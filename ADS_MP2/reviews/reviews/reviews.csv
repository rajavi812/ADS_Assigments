1.0 out of 5 stars,"I was loving my instant pot, bragging to all about it. Making my dogs food was so easy! I put in the food and the water, pressed pressure cook and like magic it was just done when it beeped.  Getting used to the pressurization wasn't hard at all.  It wasn't really difficult to use.Until last week... My pot just didn't turn on! I tried other outlets and other electronics so it was not the outlet. I moved the pot to a different outlet, nothing. It was the pot. The manual gave explicit troubleshooting directions based on what is wrong. Not turning on meant that the circuit board blew and it advised to call support, which I did. When you call, an automated message tells you to go online and put in a ticket- because this is clearly a company that doesn't want to be bothered 'talking' to their customers. So I do this. A day later no response! So I email again asking for help. This time I email them the same information. Didn't hear from them until Friday! I needed my pot fixed on Tuesday.... On Thursday though I had had enough and called Amazon who thankfully knows how to treat customers and were able to refund me the product and I shipped it back to them. The pot was less than a year of purchase and within warranty after all! Even Amazon tried getting ahold of the company and they couldn't get a response!Beware of this brand! I would look for another pressure cooker because when it breaks, and it likely will, you won't be getting help for days....My first attempt to post this review Amazon blocked for an unknown reason. It should be posted though people should know what kind of company this is..."
1.0 out of 5 stars,"Im not sure what happened here, because i know this is a good product. I attempted to cook food, my first run, and 15 minutes later The entire machine is in smokes. Quickly filled my kitchen and house with a horid smoke of burnt plastic. There were sparks coming off the bottom of the machine while it was turned on . I quickly unplugged the machine and turned it over to inspect the counter . I ask myself what would have happened if it had caught fire, or exploded in my face . The sound it was making seemed like it was going to.  As you see the plastic melted, it was liquid all over my counter, and it was not easy to clean off the counter or my tainted hands. The bottom of the machine and remaining wires where bright, scolding red. I ruined kitchen towels, had to shower again before going to work. I was running late because of the ordeal i had to deal with. Forced to eat out with my wife because, just wasted the food being cooked wich was about to be amazing. . . . The worst thing is i am writing this and the machine goes in smokes for no reason. What do i do? This thing is just going in smokes unplugged. This is terriblleee."

How did I live without this before???I live in a Sprinter van full-time and was using an induction burner for cooking, but since I've gotten this little gem, I haven't used the induction burner once!This is so easy to use, and it's the perfect size for one or two people. I've been making a lot of stews, and I'll saute the onions, carrots, and meat (if I'm using meat) then add everything else, seal it, and set it for 7 minutes on high pressure. I let it release naturally and have a perfectly cooked, tasty meal every time. This gives me enough for 4 or 5 servings.I also quick soaked beans the other day by covering them with water, hitting pressure for 5 min. then letting it release naturally and let it sit (not on keep warm) for a couple of hours.I'll often make dinner right after I reheat my lunch, and make sure the keep warm function is on. I'm able to drive with it in my sink and have a hot, healthy, delicious meal waiting for me when I'm done driving.I've even baked banana bread in it!!! So exciting, because I don't have an oven. It turned out SO good! I used one of the containers and the lid from my To-Go Ware stainless steel lunch container to bake it in on the rack.Because this cooks so quickly, it is very easy on my solar system. I can reheat leftovers on saute in 4 minutes, and it's only drawing 67a while it's on.I did have a VitaClay, that I absolutely loved for making beans, and especially bone broth, but it takes much longer to cook and is heavier. So, more battery drain, more storage space, and more weight as compared to the Instant Pot Mini and the Mini wins on each count!"
1.0 out of 5 stars,"This pot is designed to not work. The surface area of the pressure indicating valve is too small for the weight of the valve to be lifted by steam pressure. Result? The valve stays open and the pot simply boils away the liquid inside and does not build pressure. The ""solution"" is to use an implement of some sort to manually pull the indicating valve up into a sealed position once the pot starts to make steam. If this is not done, the valve will not lift and seal and water will simply boil away. It is important to note that this is not due to a dirty valve, a sticky valve, insufficient liquid or any malfunction. Rather, it is designed into the pot. Ours will be relegated to stock pot duty as we have found it to be totally unusable as a pressure cooker."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I was chatting with a friend who just got a ninja foodi, saying how I love my instant pot but wished I had the Duo Crisp version.  I had just bought a 3quart air fryer, but liked the idea of returning that one and using my instant pot to do it all.  I also was excited that this air fryer mechanism is branded by and designed for this instant pot.  I happened to find this when it was still in stock and got it!  OMG this is amazing!I did some quick comparisons between air fried things using this lid and in my other air fryer (chicken tenders, mozzarella sticks), and they both come out the same!  There are a few differences to note:1 - The air frying basket included with this lid seems a little on the narrow side.  The one on my air fryer is a bit wider and shorter.  However, this lid comes with a rack you can use, so you essentially get two levels to air fry on!  I love that!2 - You don't *have* to use the air fryer basket that comes with the lid - you can use ANY oven safe item that fits in the regular pot (or just use the stainless steel pot that comes with the instant pot).  I'm currently searching for a multi rack that can fit in this thing so I can use it as a dehydrator rack.3 - The ""turn now"" feature on the lid is pretty neat.  Nice little halfway point reminder (which is easier to me than remembering to do so.Another bonus is that the things people miss about the duo crisp (cough cough, yogurt function) aren't things I have to give up just to have an instant pot that air fries.Only ""negative"" is that you can't just keep the instant pot plugged in while you use the lid.  In fact ,the plug on the lid has this webbing type of thing that prevents you from using the other plug in the outlet.  If you're air frying things that shouldn't be a problem, but if you're doing something like dehydrating, which takes a while, you'll have a plug out of commission.Really excited to experiment with new things!Minor edit: one annoyance is that unlike a conventional air fryer, there’s no easy way to pour things from the air basket to a plate. You have to either use tongs/a spatula to remove the food or oven mitts to lift the basket out of the instant pot liner"
1.0 out of 5 stars,Just worked a year! The light is on but no heat. I called the customer service and got the answer was if it is over a year warranty that I need buy a new pot base as almost the whole cooker's price.  Very disappointed!
5.0 out of 5 stars,"UPDATED - So I finally got the 6QT and oh. my. g... - so wonderful! Such a relief! I can cook 5 lbs of frozen chicken in ONE cycle and have food for my dog for the next week! Yay! And last night I finally made that famous ""soccer mom spaghetti"" (dump a box of pasta, one jar of sauce, a bag of frozen meatballs plus a jar of water in the pot then push a button) and - perfect. I made this same thing in the 3qt about a few times and it never came out right - first the pasta didn't cook, next time the sauce was too watery, etc. With the 6QT - cooked perfectly! And I have FIVE portions of leftovers instead of the 1-2 I had with the smaller I.P.To put the 3qt vs 6qt in perspective: the 3qt pot does not actually cook 3 quarts because you can't fill it all the way to the top. There's a line that's oh, an inch or two below the lip that's the Max Fill line, because the pressure cooker needs extra room to do its thing. Then, if you're adding the trivet, you're losing another inch of space. So really your cooking space is more like 2 quarts, like a small sauce pan.Imagine you're cooking ALL of your meals with nothing bigger than a sauce pan.Then you've got the 6qt pot, which is like the big pots you use to boil pasta. Or make soup.Pasta pot vs sauce pan. You see what I'm saying?Anyway, now my problem is that I have to stop cooking so often because I have no more room in my freezer...  :)********ABOUT THE 3 QT DUO --- As Instant Pots go, I'll not reiterate what everyone else says but agree that it's a game changer, and totally revolutionizes your cooking. However, I have some regrets...3QT Too Small for Lazy Cooks Like Me --- When I to move into my Airstream trailer full time, I decided to get an Instant Pot as I thought it would help minimize the amount of cooking appliances I needed. And of course, being solo (plus a dog and cat) I figured the 3Qt was the better choice. After 7 months with it, I am desperate to trade my 3Qt for the 6QT. I like cooking, but I'm lazy and would prefer to make a large batch once and have left overs, than have to cook for every meal. Reheating leftovers is far easier to clean up than cooking a fresh meal. I'm lazy at cleaning, too.Instant Pot Learning Curve --- Instant Pot cooking takes some getting used to, and while there is a great abundance of tips and such online, which are fabulous, about 95% of them are for 6QT or larger. Finding good, appropriate recipes for the 3QT is frustrating and has led to lots of failed meals, as ingredients plus liquids, cooking time, etc are all out of proportion.Where Are All The Accessories for 3QT? --- In the same vein as above, there are tons and tons of accessories for the Instant Pot, but... they're all for 6QT, not a lot for 3QT. I'm starting to see more 3QT-sized accessories (like steam baskets, gaskets, lids, egg bites silicone molds, etc), but only from, like, a single manufacturer. As opposed to stuff for the 6 qt, where you've got a dozen steam baskets to choose from.Home Cooked Dog Food --- Finally, as I'm traveling a lot city to city, I've started making food for my dog (an 80lb Labrador) as we could never find the brand of dog kibble that she liked and that was good for her. In this situation, the Instant Pot has been my savior, as it's soooo easy to just plop a bunch of raw, frozen chicken or other meats into the pot, slap on lid, push a button and within the hour, I've got tons of fall-off-the-bone meat for my pup's next breakfast (because I inevitably forget to cook for her the night before, and have to do it right at her mealtime). But normal instances when making a batch of her food, again, because I have the 3QT, I could only cook a portion of the meat, take it out, do a quick scrub of the pot before cooking the other portion - whereas with a 6QT that could be done with just one cycle.In short, if you're thinking about getting a 3Qt for your first and only Instant Pot, don't! Just go for the 6Qt and make your life much easier."
1.0 out of 5 stars,"I was so excited to finally be able to purchase my instant pot for my birthday but was disappointed when it came. The first thing I noticed when I opened the lid was that it smelled like it had been used and the inner pot had water spots. I emptied the box it came in and it was missing all of the accessories listed on the box as well as the condensation collector, which the manual stated must be installed before use."
1.0 out of 5 stars,Had just over one year. Very disappointed. This electrical failure happened when I was cooking chicken a week ago. We started to smell something like plastic and this is what happened. Very scared what might have happened if we had not been home. Nothing seems to last anymore.
2.0 out of 5 stars,"2 Malfunctioning (and one damaged) 8 qt Duo units were shipped to me.  Not until they sent me one from different stock did I get a properly functioning one.  LOOK OUT for faulty steam release valve/handles.  If you have the steam release handle pointing to the “sealing” position, steam should NOT be escaping from it while you do the “water test” and the pot comes up to pressure, or while it is cooking at pressure.  You should only be having steam escape out of that valve when you turn it toward “venting.”  This is seperate from the pink float valve.  It is normal for some steam to escape from the pink float valve until it pops up & the pot comes to pressure.If the steam only stops coming out of the steam release valve/handle by pushing it past the spot marked “sealing,” where it feels like it’s NOT supposed to go, or if it keeps coming out no matter what you do, then learn from me: YOU have a DEFECTIVE one!  When I talked with the Instant Pot technical support with my last one, they told me to turn it off, unplug it, and not attempt to use it again.I ordered mine during the pre-holiday/ Black Friday sales (Nov 2017).  The first I was shipped came badly dented in (probably shipping damage since the outside box was bashed in, too.)  The next two I was sent were BOTH defective.  It wasn’t until I requested I be sent a replacement from different stock, that I got a properly functioning one!  I’m so relieved to finally have a functioning one as of today, January 29th, 2018, two months later!  4th time’s the charm, I guess?  Seriously, it took them sending me 4 Instant Pots, and a lot of headache & my time before I got a properly functioning one.  I will say, that they did at least cover the shipping (as was Amazon’s responsibility since it was an Amazon fulfilled order) for all the replacements, and did even over-night ship one of the times (the third pot...by the fourth, I got the sense the customer service person suspected it was MY fault, so they seemed less eager to help.  I do have pictures & proof of the problematic units they shipped me, and verification that it was NOT user error or my fault.  I’m just so relieved that my 4th one works so I don’t have to deal with this anymore!)So, Quality Control Issues.IF you get a functioning unit, these really are nice.  Seems everyone around me has one & loves them.  I may not have figured out that my second unit was defective, if it hadn’t been for me brining it to a group get-together where two other friends cooked the exact same recipe (with no problem) in their Instant Pots, while mine malfunctioned with it because of the defective steam release valve/handle, which caused the subsequent “burn” code when trying to come up to pressure.  I had suspected it might be defective before, but was having a hard time ruling out novice user error, or bad recipes, etc.Pictures: 1) First one came dented in.  2 & 3) pictures from one of the units with defective steam release valve, in case Instant Pot sees this and wants that info. to help correct manufacturing/quality control problem.  4) Shows manual saying that the problem indicates “pressure control fails”and to “contact support.”  Also shows where I wrote ticket number from my call with Instant Pot technical support.If I knew how to post videos, I have video of what it looks & sounds like doing the “water test” with the defective steam release valve.  Basically, it noisily spits steam and water out the steam release valve, even when it is in “sealing” position.Hope my very bad luck helps things go better for someone else, especially if there are any other defective units still getting shipped to people!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"My instant pot never gets put away. It cooks to perfection everything we cook. Perfect, pasta, boiled eggs, rice, chicken, broccoli. Everything. The secret is the fact that you can time everything to the perfect time setting.No need to get the latest most expensive unit. They all do the excact same thing. The more expensive options are things like a button that says egg. The egg button will cost you $20.00. It sets a timer for five minutes."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Just received this air fryer lid today for my existing 6 quart instant pot.  It worked amazingly well with the two batches of chicken wings and fries that I cooked.  The chicken wings turned out crispy and juicy, and the fries turned out even better than the deep fried version!  I also tried making crispy brussel sprouts which turned out deliciously well.The fryer circulates air effectively and definitely gets hot enough to make food crispy.  Lifting the lid to check on the food is easy, especially with the included plastic pad that you can rest the lid on while it's hot.  Keep in mind that this air fryer only works with certain instant pot models, so make sure to check that yours is compatible.No problems so far with this air fryer lid - my instant pot is now my go-to and most used kitchen appliance!  Very happy with this purchase and can't wait to use it more."

4.0 out of 5 stars,"I’m used to cook once a week for 5 days, you call it meal prep. It means Sunday is a busy day and sometimes, we’ll most of the times, you have no time or you are too busy with raising your kids so you end up making food at night.When I first saw it, I ignored it as another gimmick I usually ignore. ADs don’t work on me and this also didn’t. After couple of days I saw a news company report about the most selling product on Amazon, it was this POT.So I did my research and bought it, DUO nova. Very confusing names and you basically have no idea what’s the difference between them. 10in 1 or 7 in 1... they are doing the same thing and you NEVER going to use these options, most of your food will be cooked on manual cooking.This pot is very good and easy to work with. I hate washing it but food is done faster and better. Basically if you follow Youtubers recipes, it’s foolproof. I like it so far, time will tell... I’ll make sure to update this review in a few months."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I looked at this item for a long time before I finally decided to buy it. What I don't need is another device in my house, but I use my crockpot almost every weekend and loved the idea that I could cook stuff so much quicker with the instant pot.I unpacked it and read over the instructions for testing it out to make sure everything worked. After the test, I decided to try my first dish. I had a frozen salmon fillet and this was one of the selling points, that you can cook frozen food and it will be just fine.  My problem is that I always forget to take food out of the freezer to thaw.I grabbed a frozen filet and per the directions that I found online I added water and lemon juice to the pot and sprayed the steamer rack with non stick spray. I put the filet on the rack and cooked it for 4 minutes. I didn't use any seasonings. The salmon was perfect and so yummy! I couldn't believe it.Over the weekend I made chili and mac and cheese. The chili only took 14 minutes after browning the meat and the mac and cheese took 4 minutes.I love this so much. I can't wait to cook more items using the different functions."
1.0 out of 5 stars,This product is a piece of crap.  It stopped working right after the 30 day no-return time frame passed which I didn't even know existed.  I found an Instant Pot website and wrote in for help but got no response.  I didn't even know there was a 30 day policy to return it because it stopped working just before the busy holiday season.  I can't believe it.  I just paid $119 to add to the landfill.  So disappointed Amazon does not stand behind this product.  DON'T BUY THIS PRODUCT.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've been using the 6 qt IP, but always had way too much food left over.  I bought the 3 qt mini for use in our camping trailer.  However, I ended up dragging it home and using it there.  It's a perfect size for just the wife and myself.  Things have gotten to the point that my wife says, ""I don't want to cook.  Pull out the little pot (IP mini) and make dinner (spaghetti, soup, whatever).""  My fault for becoming proficient with the use of the Instant Pots.  When we have company to dinner, I use the 6 qt. IP.  I love it!  Just had to order a stainless 3 qt. liner pot for it (with a silicon lid) in case I need to put something in it in the refrigerator ... or use it to cook something separately."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"For a long time, I wasn't a believer.  I mean, I'm all for electronic gadgets in the kitchen.  If I want to cook something for hours until its delicious and tender, I've got a traditional slow cooker.  If I want to feel fancy when I'm preparing perfectly-cooked meats, I've got my Anova sous vide, and a wireless meat thermometer for the grill.  But friends and family were always like, ""Oh but you gotta get an Instant Pot!""  But no, I didn't _have_ to get an Instant Pot.Eventually, though, there was a sale, and I bought one.  Now, I didn't really have any meaningful concept of the differences between the sizes and models.  This 8 quart Duo Plus came up as a daily deal thing, and I bought it.  It was a good price.  And you know, it can make like 2 gallons of yogurt or porridge or something, so...great...whatever.I'll be the first to admit that I didn't count on the sheer size of the thing.  At the time, it was just my wife and I and our two-year-old daughter.  When I unboxed this 8-quart monstrosity, I experienced a moment of trepidation, a fear of ridicule from my wife, who would point out that we don't need a really really ridiculously huge pressure cooker for just us.  But I moved on from that anxiety, and I set about putting this thing to work.The first time each of us used it, we felt what I'm sure every other pressure cooker rookie feels at first—the crippling fear that you're about to die in a horrific high-pressure home explosion, and that your family will always be embarrassed to explain that they were related to one of _those_ statistics.  But, as I'm sure most pressure cooker owners do, we survived.And it didn't take long before we realized (my wife especially, since she does a lot of the cooking) how fantastic this giant culinary autoclave really is.  Cook an entire dinner of roast chicken with red beans & rice in one go?  Done.  Steam a whole mess 'o veggies when some friends show up with their gaggle of kids for dinner?  Easy.  Meatballs.  Tamales.  Artichokes.  Corn on the cob.  All quickly and (perhaps most significantly) very simple.  And there's just a single pot to scrub at the end!  Then just throw it back in the pantry until next time.Last night I think I reached my true peak of giant Instant Pot appreciation.  I cooked two racks of BBQ pork back ribs.  I thought about just taking the meat to my dad's house and letting him do them in the smoker.  But that would have taken like 10 hours!  I could have tried the sous vide, but that would required me to cut up the ribs into ziploc-sized portions, to come up with a way to cook that much meat together in a bigger cooler than I usually use, and to then clean up the mess and cook for at least a few hours to get a good texture.  And who has that kind of time when there's football to be watched and naps to be taken?  Want to know how long I spent preparing this meal in the Instant Pot?  We wanted to eat at 6pm.  I boldly began my process at 5:00.- Five minutes unwrapping and rubbing the meat and stuffing it all into my countertop sauna.  I'll leave the visualization to you.- Twenty minutes as the Instant Pot got up to cooking pressure.- 25 minutes cooking + 2 minutes decompressing (and filling the house with delicious porky aroma)- Five minutes painting on some sauce and letting everything sizzle on the grill.Seriously.  Delicious, perfectly cooked barbecue ribs—enough to feed at least eight people—ready in about an hour.So yeah.  I'm a fan.  And even though it's comically large when we're just cooking for ourselves, I'm glad I got the 8 qt monster after all.  I haven't even explored all of the fancy other options and space-age things it can do.  But I will.  If only because I can.  Thanks, Instant Pot!  <insert smile with tooth sparkle and ""ding"" sound>"

5.0 out of 5 stars,"I just got this in the mail today and decided to give it a go. I air fried some frozen french fries at 400° for 20 minutes. Halfway through the cooking cycle it beeped to remind me to toss my food. The fries came out perfectly cooked.The box comes with the lid, basket, basket case, dehydrator pan, instruction and warranty manuals, and a base for the lid. Well worth the expense so far.I'm going to try roasting and dehydrating soon!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Instant Pot IP-DUO Plus60 9-in-1 Multi-Functional Pressure Cooker, 6 Qt  - I've wanted a PC for a long time and have done a lot of research. I was originally leaning towards the PPCXL because that's what my cousin has, but I did some more research and ended with this one, waiting until the Duo Plus came out.  So, since I'm the 4th reviewer, here's some of the thought process I went through in deciding to get the DUO Plus and also some thoughts on the IP vs the PPCXL and also other considerations on accessories, size, etc. So far, I've only had it a few days, but overall satisfied and plenty of online support for recipes and helping you decide the post PC for your needs.**Why I went with the Instant Pot (IP) duo60 Plus -Three new preset buttons - cake, egg, sterilize. It also had the yogurt function which other IP do, but not some of the other makes.Large LCD Screen with  Digital DisplayMute button for those beeps in the night when cooking yogurt etc.Plus / Minus button for both time and pressureKeep Warm Selector can be selected to on or off at anytime.Delay start of 24 hours and keep warm for 10 hours.Lid rest (right or left side)**Why I went with IP vs PPCXL -Food Grade 304 (15/8) stainless steel pot vs stainless steel with teflon coating. I felt I could scrub and treat the pot however I wanted and not worry about scratching and what utensils to not use. Yes, you can buy a replacement inner pot for a Teflon pot, but after I spend $100+ I really don't think I should have to buy a replacement inner pot.  Some of the FB group users are fine with the Teflon pot, but there are also a lot of complaints, so it might be in the handling, but every Teflon pan I ever had eventually got tossed out because of the coating coming off.IP came with some of the accessories you pay for on the PPCXL. It had the trivet with handles, condensation collector, Rice Paddle & spoon and a couple intro guides/cookbooks.Free shipping for IP.  PPCXL site wanted $29.99Buttons weren't quite clear on PPCXL site so it made me think they were hiding lack of selection on preset buttons.  Also, confusing on what you were buying - regular PPC or PPCXL. A lot of their verbiage refers to PPCXL, but not necessarily when you go select your items for your shopping cart.Yogurt Button - The IP has this and the PPCXL doesn't.  The IP allows you to bring the milk to 185 in the IP, cool to 120 (I will be using the quick cool method in the sink) and then put in yogurt mode for incubation (8-12 hours). The PPCXL doesn't have this and you wrap it and put it in the oven.Warranty on IP is 1 year and I went with the Square Trade Warranty for 4 years for an additional $14.37. No deductible, no hidden fees, no shipping, transferable. PPC has 60 day money back/replacement. After that up to one year you have to pay $24.99 for shipping. Their extended warranty if $15 for 3 years.Slow Cooker Mode had a low, medium and high heat button.IP has a + and - sign to increase or decrease the time. Others you have to select a preset and keep pressing to increase, you can't decrease time.Overall ratings - IP 4.7 and PPCXL 4.1.  I read through a lot of comments by verified buyers and the PPC owners seemed a lot more upset with customer service.  I looked through a lot of Reviewers who do this for a living or at least blog and they leaned towards the IP.I messaged with the PPCXL people online and you can tell they've been coached for answers knowing what their down faults are and not really answering the question or referencing what you know is a negative.There are more IPs on the market and most recipes are geared towards it from a ""preset button"" perspective.IP has a left and right handle that will hold your lid tilted.I belong to a Pressure Cooker group - there are a lot of complaints about other manufacturer's instructions, quick start guide, etc. Lots of issues with lids locking, not pressurizing etc and I really don't see this for the Instant Pot family of PCs.**Sizing -I measured my crock pot which was 6 quart, so that's what I ordered.  It's an OK size for 2 people, but since you can only fill it 2/3 full when cooking under pressure you should take that into consideration. I figure on a roast, I will do the meat first, then veggies. The 6 quart will hold four pint canning jars for sterilization.**Accessories -What else to buy?  I got the OXO Good Grips steamer with extendable handle and a pack of 3-IP Rings color coded (dark for savory meats, orange for desserts and I will use the clear for yogurt).  I had read they were dishwasher safe, but not 100% as they might keep flavors.On my next order I'm looking at 2 cookbooks (IP Electric Pressure Cooker Cookbook for $9 and IP Obsession for $12). There are plenty of Facebook Group pages you can join for recipes too and online reviewers. Just type in what you are making followed by ""in a pressure cooker"" or ""in an IP"". I'm also buying IP Silicone Mitts for easy removal of a hot pot since I will be making yogurt ($10).The only negative of the Instant Pot is you can't get a 10 quart and if I had a REALLY big family that would be the only reason, but basedon the above, I would probably just buy a 2nd Instant Pot.I hope this is helpful.  I did a lot of research and felt the need to share it. I will update this as I use it and get additional questions.8/9/2017 update - I've been using my IP for a few months now.  I use my steamer basket and trivet a lot. I make a ""bowl"" out of heavy duty foil and put on the trivet when making a whole chicken and it makes trivet clean-up easier.  I bought an IP plain glass lid for slow cooker & yogurt mode.  I don't use my extra rings cause I use my plain lid for yogurt, so no use to swap rings.  I didn't get the silicone mitts. I realized I didn't need them. My inner pot doesn't get that hot on yogurt mode. I like the 2 cookbooks.  I use Bar Keeper Friend to clean the pot.  Still really happy with my IP-DUO Plus 60. I'm part of a FB PC group and I don't see complaints on the IP. Very happy with my purchase.12/29/2017 update - So on Black Friday I bought the 3 qt Instant Pot because I felt like I need to have twins.  It's a great size and great forsides and especially my 2 quart of yogurt I make at least weekly, so it doesn't tie up my 6 qt IP. We winter in FL and I was able to ""sneak"" the6 qt into the truck and now I have the 3 qt here too. I made an entire Thanksgiving dinner for Christmas (Irma got in our way last month repairing) in the 2 pots. In future years, I'll prob just bring the 3 qt cause it fits better in my cabinets in the mobile home."

1.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought this due to all the highly positive reviews. Got this last night, and attempted to cook rice using their instructions. What an unmitigated disaster. Over all impressions:- The personification of ""Made in China"" cheap quality. The plastic had treads, the metal lining wore off the minute I tried to align the lid, the instructions are in poorly written English that leaves one confused as to whats what.- The rice, even though I followed the instructions to the ""T"", ended up being burnt.Going back today!"
3.0 out of 5 stars,"When the IP works, it's great. Really great. I get good food made cheap, and it's helped me explore vegetarianism and veganism, which i was interested in.That's about 50% of the time. The other 50% it screws up by not pressurising, and you inevitably find yourself wandering down an internet rabbit-hole trying to find the solution. Is it the sealing ring? Is it too full? Does it have too much or too little liquid? Should I deglaze it? Did I deglaze it (and 'deglaze' is the stupidest word in the world for 'scraping food off the bottom of the pot')? Is it something else?Yesterday I:steamed six hardboiled eggs. Easy. IP pressurised just fine.Today I:Prepared lentil curry, following instructions as closely as possible.Put IP on to pressure cook.IP doesn't pressurise. I open it and add more water.Still doesn't pressurise. I open it and deglaze the pot.Still doesn't pressurise. I check the sealing ring and it's in place.Still doesn't pressurise. Very carefully wipe and clean the inner rim.Still doesn't pressurise. Empty the contents into a bowl, scrape more hardened food off bottom of pot, wash and dry it, put it back in, fill it with only half the curry I originally put in, in case it was too full (even though it wasn't).Still doesn't pressurise.Check the condensation cup, empty that, put it back on. Why the hell not? I've tried everything else. Check the inside of the pressure valve, which is fine.Put lid back on. Still doesn't pressurise. Except this time I can hear a faint hissing where there wasn't one before and shouldn't be.Next step: bang head on wall. Employ expletives learned from the sailing community. And, frankly, consider just throwing the thing in the trash.When a machine is so sensitive to failure that it just throws a hissy-fit at random times, there's no way you can rely on it."
1.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased this Instant Pot with high hopes, I have many friends who love theirs!  I tried 5 different recipes, I didn't care for the result of the first 4.  On the 5th attempt to make something in it the whole unit shorted out in the middle of cooking time and will not turn back on.  I will be returning it today.  It made chili flavorless and watery, it made chicken and pork chops have a strange texture, and when I tried beef stew it was more like beef soup. I admit I am a pretty picky eater and love to cook, so I was hoping for an appliance that would make cooking easier and faster for my family of 6, but I was completely disappointed. I would not recommend it to anyone."
1.0 out of 5 stars,Arrived broken. The plastic tracks that hold the condensation cup had been broken off. The first person that received the item must have tried to pull the cup off instead of sliding it off. This must have been a returned item sold as new. I've requested a replacement and now will have to go through the process of repacking the whole thing.
4.0 out of 5 stars,"Was excited to try this when it arrived yesterday. While putting on the  plastic steam collector (it slips onto 2 very fragile and tiny black brackets) one of the brackets fell off. I immediately called Instapot and they told me to put a towel Near the back if I wanted to use it and return it to Amazon. I decided to try and cook Brussel sprouts and 2 large baked potatoes. Since I had to send it back I wanted to make sure I was happy with the way it cooked. I was delighted. In less than 13 minutes I had cooked perfect baked potatoes and Brussel sprouts, even though there seems to be a learning curve. I can see this is going to change my cooking habits and I can probabally store some of my cooking pots. Needless to say, I requested a replacement and not a refund. I am only giving this 4 stars due to what appears to be a defect in those fragile brackets.  The tech support guy certainly understood what I was talking about. Attidional note: there are just 2 of us so I ordered the 3 quart. I should have ordered the 6 quart because If I time things right this will take the place of 2-3 pots on the stove."
1.0 out of 5 stars,"I put the inner pot in the dishwasher before first use.  It came out covered by rusty stains.  The inner pot is supposed to be made of STAINLESS steel and dishwasher safe.  Neither appeared to be true.  I had other dishes in the dishwasher and they all came out clean so it wasn't something in the water.  I'll post a photo here for others to see.  Because of that I never used the cooker, so I can't comment on its function.  I returned it immediately."
1.0 out of 5 stars,Worked great for about 2 weeks.  After that it would no longer pressurize.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have used this a few times on homemade fries, sweet potato home fries, and what has blown me away homemade tostones. I will try this week on preasure cooking a whole chicken then browning with the air fryer attachement and I really look forward to making homemade wings. This has been a game changer for me. I have never tried another air frier so I have nothing to compare it to but this is all I will need."
1.0 out of 5 stars,"I expected this to last more than a year but less than 3 months I noticed the inner shell paint coating melted and stuck onto the inner stainless steel pot. I opened a claim with Instant Pot customer service, and this is how they handle an upset customer:""This rim is protected by a layer of heat and rust resistant paint. That being said, please note that it is not rust proof, neither is it chip or scratch proof. We can confirm that the materials in the paint are non-toxic and have passed LFGB and FDA safety tests. It is perfectly normal to have chips in the paint during normal use, and as such is not covered under warranty."".First of all, this is not rust. If it is protected by a layer of heat resistant paint as stated in the email content, then it wouldn't melt and the paint coating got stuck on the pot. Obviously either Instant Pot rep is lying or I got a defected one.  I am not complaining about the cosmetic look but I am upset that Instant Pot doesn't live up to its brand and quality. Not only that, their customer service rep is mean and they turn their customers away by lying with a ton of excuses (for example, saying that it is RUST... haha, yea right. Does that look like rust?)Secondly, I work hard for my money so when I buy a product, I do research and I expect it to last for several years. This is unacceptable."
1.0 out of 5 stars,"The airfryer itself is great but after using it, the instant pot stops working. It comes to pressure, counts down, beeps to indicate food is ready - and when I opened the lid, food is still frozen and rice water was still there.I sent their support an email about it 6 days ago with no reply.I then tried calling and after waiting online for 40 minutes I needed to hang up.I still did not receive any support.DO NOT BUY."
1.0 out of 5 stars,I used this 3 times and it quit working.  I loved it when it worked but it is taking the company too long to help me out. VERY Frustrating!!
1.0 out of 5 stars,"I have bought 2 of these over last 2 years. Lid melted both times. First time it was after 1 year, Second time within a year, so contacted Instant pot for warranty, and they directed us to buy lid from their website."
1.0 out of 5 stars,"I was very excited to get my new Instant Pot, and ready to start cooking immediately on our vacation! I love to cook & we always seek vacation  lodgings w kitchenettes. But something odd happened when I did the Instant Pot's ""initial test run"" as described in the user's manual. (3 c. water, set at ""steam"") Steam kept leaking from the closed vent, and when the cycle finished and I allowed a ""natural"" release of pressure, a big puddle formed on my counter. There is a small plastic drip-catcher that snaps in place on the back of the pot; this ended up with a 1/2"" of water. But most of the little running stream of water from the vent missed the cup. I was not able to find anyplace online that said this is normal, so I decided to get Instant Pot Customer Support. It was almost 5 PM on Fri. When I first called and got a recording that support is available weekdays from 9 -5. I wasn't sure the pot was safe--so it sat, unused, all weekend. Called Mon. AM and after waiting 10 min., the fellow on the support line couldn't tell what was going on, but said DO NOT use the pot. He also said to do the ""initial test run"" again, and video the results to show the problem, then take pictures of the seals on the back and the bottom of the pot, and the puddle after use. I was to email all of this, with a description of the problem, to ""technical support"" at Instant Pot. Between the time I made the phone call, did the ""initial test run"" took the videos and photos, wrote up the problem, and emailed it all, I had invested almost 4 hours of my time. My vacation time!! No response from Instant pot for all of Tues. Later on Wed. I finally got an email--requesting a video of the problem and photos of the seals. Clearly nobody had looked at the materials I had already, painstakingly, sent.  Resent the video and photos, and again heard nothing for over a day. Fri. I .called again, reviewed the situation & my frustration. I was promised a phone call from technical support before end of day. Surprise! No. Phone. Call. It was the weekend again--so nobody at Instant Pot was working. On Mon. I returned the pot to Amazon--having lost the opportunity to cook on vacation. I emailed Instant Pot one last time to inform them of the return, because the performance of Customer Support was completely unacceptable."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"i have had the Instant Pot for just over a week now. I love it. it has made cooking fun and although it is not always quicker, it IS easier. I don't have to stand over the stove to make srue my food won't burn, it simply cooks and tells me when it's done. Everything i've made in it so far has been a success including perfect hard boiled eggs that peel very easily EVERY time, oatmeal, delicious yogurt from a gallon of milk, the BEST rice i've ever made, and some terrific soups and even a pot roast. I really like my new appliance and will be using it frequently. One hint though, do buy extra sealing rings, especially if you are going to be cooking sweet and savory items. the ring will retain odors and you don't want your yogurt or oatmeal tasting like last night's minestrone!"
3.0 out of 5 stars,"I eagerly awaited arrival on this and found it to be not what I expected as far as air frying.  The basket is too small and too much hands on activity is required (stirring, turning).  I used it for frozen onion rings and they were very dry on the outside and cooled off immediately after removing.  If I didn't know better, I would have thought they were baked at 325 and left to cool on the counter.  I did like the 'turn' notification at the half-way mark, but exactly how does one turn a basket of onion rings - or fries?  It has several other function.  Bake - but what in that small thing, even if I used the pot instead of the basket?  Reheat - the IP can do that itself, not to mention my toaster oven with the same wattage and more room.  Granted, it may take a tad longer to warm up.  Dehydrate - ok for herbs maybe, but not anything of size.  I basically found that there is nothing here that I can't do in the toaster oven.  I just love my IP so much that I wanted to use it with the lid.  Wrong thinking on my part.I still think the basic idea is wonderful.  It just doesn't work for me.  I saw many reviews that love it, but I just can't get it to work for me.  Applause to those for whom it works.  I just asked to return it.  Thank you Amazon for your return policy."
1.0 out of 5 stars,It worked for about 2 weeks.  Then weird things started happening and I kept thinking I did something wrong because sometimes it worked and sometimes it did not.  Well here we are 7 months later and I now accept I do not trust this pot.  This was a bad purchase and now I am stuck with something that doesn't work and I do not trust.  I can not even begin to tell you how many meals this ruined before I finally have given up.  I bought this at around $75 and now they cost over $100.  There is no way I would buy this at $100.  I can not recommend that anyone purchase this.  I would rate this a do not buy.
4.0 out of 5 stars,"Purchased ""Instant Pot DUO Plus 3 Qt 9-in-1 Multi- Use Programmable Pressure Cooker"" through Amazon from Stelli Products, delivered May 27 2019, temporarily failed this morning July 13 2019, but then started again. Maybe.The idea of an electric pressure cooker combined with a slow and other cooker is great. I have used stove-top pressure cookers for years, (Fagor),  as well as many and various slow and rice cookers. Having a programmed pressure cooker, like the rice and slow cookers, takes a lot of the worry about overcooking away from pressure cooking.I have been using this for about 6 weeks now, though only the slow and pressure cooking features, there are pluses and minuses.Pluses:Stainless steel inner pot without coatings takes concern about adverse effects from non-stick coatings away, and is easily cleanable with worrying too much about damage.Ability to have multiple pot liners ready is a plus, though I have not done that, I plan to.It seems to work very well when it works.Space-saving and versatility: It takes up no space on the stove, and can be used on any level surface anywhere the power cord can reach,  so if your cooking a bunch of dishes you have an extra spot on the stove if you need one, while the cooker can be running somewhere else, even another room.Minuses:The condensation collector cup pops off way too easy.Cleanup of the outer rim is slightly annoying with all the nooks and crannys, this could be designed better.It also seems a bit delicate. This morning I filled it up with a chili recipe, set it to slow cook for 8 hours, it started but then the screen went blank. While mixing up the recipe in the pot some splashed over the rim and about a half teaspoon of the liquid got inside between the pot and the main cooker base. I unplugged, removed the liner and wiped that down with a damp towel, and cleaned out the main pot best I could, all using a damp kitchen towel. The pot lit up, seemed to start, then went blank. It would not light up  or start after that, until about a half hour later just before I sent an email to Instant Brands asking about repairs. Now it is lighting up so I will use it again another day and see if it works. But at this point the chili is sitting in my 10 year old Panasonic SR-TMB10 rice/slow cooker, which has worked flawlessly since I bought it from Amazon in April 2009.Suggestions and advice on use:Mix up recipes outside of the cooker and place in the inner pot before placing the inner pot inside the cooker base to avoid spills getting inside the main cooker base.For slow cooking beef, as in a stew, use the highest setting. The medium setting did not do the job for me even after more than 6 hours.For pressure cooking beef, as in a stew, use the normal setting as listed in the recipe booklet. This produced a very nice and tender stew.Suggestions to Instant Brands:The design needs to be improved where the inner and outer pot meet to better avoid spills leaking inside. Splashing happens.Access to clean the base both inside and rim area could also be improved.A way to better store the included utensils, either on or inside the cooker would be a good idea IMO. See the rice cooker mentioned above, and others, for examples. I have enough clutter in my kitchen drawers, and it is too easy to misplace parts or accessories that are stored separately.The condensation collector needs to be more securely attached to the cooker, there are many better design examples on rice cookers from many sources."
1.0 out of 5 stars,"I have been trying to work with this pot since January.  I have had some successes but more failures.  Sometimes it will work, sometimes it won't.  The problems have been mainly with the pressure cooker function but this week I had a meal in the slow cooker that did not cook at all.  Even my daughter, who has cooked professionally, tried it because she was thinking about buying one and she hated it."
2.0 out of 5 stars,"We're using this pot to cook for two and it does a great job, save for one problem--the little float valve in the lid does not pop up on its own.In order to get the float valve to pop up, I have to tap on it or grab the lid and press down on it once enough pressure has been built up inside the pot.I can't tell if this is a design flaw or a fault of the valve--it's a pretty basic little thing and unless the valve is catching on a rough bore in the lid or something, I don't see why it won't raise up on its own.  Once I get it to pop up, the unit works like a charm.I was hoping it was user error, but after four months of using the pot almost weekly and experimenting with advice from online, I'm pretty sure this isn't right. Maybe I should contact the manufacturer, because right now, I have to watch the pot to ensure it will build pressure."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I ordered the 3 quart on Black Friday and it has made dinner every night since then, for the 2 of us. I ordered an extra liner so I could cook several dishes when we had company but it was a little more time consuming (the Instant Pot can make you lazy) so I decided to go for the 6 quart for when we had company, and to bake cakes and bread. From black eyed pea hummus to seafood stew I have made hundreds of dishes that came out tasting great. Dressing, cornbread, apple crumble, shrimp scampi, salmon, cod, mac and cheese...just when you think there has to be something you can’t make you will find a receipe. I have always hated to cook but the IP makes cooking fun, and when you have company, you can make preparations ahead of time, dump everything in before dinner and spend time with company instead of in the kitchen. And you won’t have a zillion pots and pans to clean.Let me add that I have several friends who have IP and they are afraid of it. It is something they bring out only occasionally and then they are “iffy” about it. If you hate cooking or don’t have time to cook or just want some healthy foods this pot will change your life if you give it a little time. Keep a notebook in the kitchen and play a little and you will soon become an expert."
1.0 out of 5 stars,"We are sending ours back.  It's not nearly as versatile as we had hoped for, and ultimately it's just a pressure cooker.  The rice function is crap.  When you sautee you need to be very careful that it's completely de-glazed, otherwise the burn warning goes off no matter how much water you add for the pressure cook... then you add so much water that any sauce or broth is watered down!The lid smells.  It reeks,  It cannot be helped. I used practically boiling water to clean it.  I removed the seal, the pressure cover, the steam cover.  All of it.  Soap, soaking in vinegar, everything.  Walked into our kitchen and when I walked past it smelled foul.  Nope.  If I have to go through that just to clean it, then the time savings to pressure cook is just not worth the exchange for a watered down flavor.THUMBS DOWN- over-hyped.  Sending it back today and getting a multi-cooker!UPDATE- as we were packaging up to return... discovered a CRACK on the lid!  We have had our slow cooker for at least 15 years!  We haven't even had this thing for two weeks.  What a piece of junk."
1.0 out of 5 stars,"Although it looks good, the truth is it’ll continue to impress and amaze you if you don’t actually cook with it. Just put it up on the mantle over your fireplace and enjoy it from afar.The very first time I actually cooked with it (after doing the water test) I’d planned on doing a slow cooked pulled pork meal. I set it on slow cook and after 4 hours it barely browned the roast. Now I have an incredibly busy career and work schedule and no time to start over so I turned it off and switched to pressure cook and that’s when the four of July rekindled!After about 5 minutes the steamer nozzle began its arduous task of spewing water and steam all over my tiny perfect little kitchen in my tiny beautiful little houseboat here on Lake Union.Yes... my kitchen was turning into a rain forest and the overwhelming smell of BBQ sauce.I managed to bare through till the end. After the meal was over I began cleaning immediately. There were parcels of meat stuck on the bottom so I took a soft cloth and a pinch of comet to clean it off. It removed not only the meat but it also removed all the finish off the bottom of the insert. It was totally gone and looked horrible. After some thought into the future of my IntsaPot I simply concluded that it would continue to become more scratched and burn more food.I hope this helps you out in your purchasing of the InstaPot and good luck👌"
1.0 out of 5 stars,Died after only 4 months. Only used it 5 times.
1.0 out of 5 stars,1st one had a pressure fail after 3 weeks of use.  Replacement had a similar problem on 1st use.  Returning for full refund.  Called the mfg and was told they got a bad batch of pressure valves and to send in a trouble ticket.  Tired of spending time scalding food.  Great idea ruined by horrid QC.  Buy at your own risk.
1.0 out of 5 stars,"I used it twice and it quit working while I was using it the second time.  Had to finish cooking my meal in my crockpot and eat it the following day.  Notified Amazon and they are sending a replacement and a return label with free shipping on the return and replacement instant pot.  I hope this one doesn't quit working.  If it does, I'm will probably get my money back and just use my crockpot instead.I checked everything that the instruction book said to check.  Everything was fine.  Checked the outlet and it was fine too.  Plugged it into a different outlet with the same result.  It's such an expensive item to purchase and it quit working on second use.  We will see what happens when I get my replacement.  Just bummed."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I LOVE my Instant Pot!  But I will be the first to admit that it can be a little intimidating at first, and it can feel like it has a steep learning curve (and I'm a tech reviewer and tech lawyer, and one of those people who generally just jumps in and figures things out without reading the manuals (""Manuals? We don't need no stinkin' manuals!""), so for me to feel like I'm not 'getting' something ..well,  yeah.  So if you are feeling a little bewildered by your new Instant Pot, *you're not alone*!)  Plus, the manual does *not* include certain information that I, at least, was looking for.  Such as, how long is each pre-programmed cooking cycle?  Exactly what temperature do the various sauté settings heat to?  Things like that.So, here are a few tips that have really helped me to finally 'get' it, plus instructions for two things that you can make in your Instant Pot that will change your life:  incredibly easy perfectly poached eggs in 2-3 minutes, and baked potatoes in 12 minutes.First, it is almost impossible to mess up with this thing to a point of being dangerous, so if you're concerned about the exploding pressure cookers of yore, you needn't be (I said ""almost"", don't go overriding your pot's safety features and then blame me when you poke an eye out).  The lid audibly tells you when its sealed (when you turn it clockwise), and the pot won't even build up much pressure if you haven't properly closed the steam release handle by turning it, too, clockwise.  The most likely point at which a problem could arise would be if you try to open the lid (by turning it counter-clockwise) before all of the pressure has been released and normalized (so don't do that).  The pot visually lets you know when it's safe to open the pot, by the float valve (the little silver post that pops up when the pot is pressurized) dropping back down flush with the lid instead of being popped up.  Think of the float valve as the reverse of a turkey pop-up button, in the case of the float valve it's done when the button pops *in*, instead of out.The sauté function has three temperature settings:  'Normal' heats to 320 degrees, 'More' heats to 338 degrees, and 'Less' heats to 221 degrees (all in Fahrenheit)For pressure cooking, you will probably use 'manual' nearly all the time (nearly every Instant Pot cookbook I've read relies on the manual setting almost exclusively).  So *don't* feel badly for not using all of those other buttons very much, if at all (I've never used any of the preprogrammed buttons).The preprogrammed settings each have their own timing, and *variable* pressure, which the pot manipulates by manipulating the temperature of the contents (the higher the temperature, the higher the pressure).  That is primarily what makes them different from manual, which provides one consistent pressure (either high or low).  However they *generally* bring the contents to high pressure, fluctuating the temperature a little so that the pressure fluctuates a little too, for a set period of time (the main exceptions to this are the rice button, and the multigrain button).  Personally I just find it easier to use 'manual' and set the time that I want.After you hit 'manual' to start cooking, you then set the amount of time you want it to cook at pressure, after which you will have a 10-second grace period (for example to add more time, etc.), after which the display will switch to displaying the word ""on"".  Then it will be a while before the display switches to the timer countdown.  This is *normal*.  The amount of time you enter is for how long it will cook *after it reaches full pressure* (either high or low pressure, depending on what you selected), and so the timer will switch on when it reaches full pressure.The cooking time in any recipe is the time *at full pressure*, not in total.  So you need to take into account the time it will take to reach full pressure (which depends on many variables, including what is in the contents of the pot, what temperature they started at, and your altitude), *and* how long it will take for the pressure to be released and normalized (i.e. for the float valve to pop in, which of course is really ""dropping in"", but you get the point).  And this brings us to the two different types of pressure release.All Instant Pot recipes will include (or *should* include) either one of these terms:  natural pressure release (also known as NPR), or quick pressure release (QPR or QR).  What these mean is simply either ""let the pressure dissipate on its own"" (natural pressure release), or ""force the pressure to escape immediately by turning the steam release handle counter-clockwise to the open position (quick release).  The reason for using quick release (QR) is not because you are too impatient to wait for natural release, but because your food will be over cooked if you don't get it the heck out of dodge once it's done cooking at pressure.  A really good example of a food needing quick release is poached eggs (which come out *perfectly* in the Instant Pot (see how to poach eggs in the Instant Pot below)).  On the other hand, lots of (if not most) foods need the natural release - it's part of their cooking process and processing time.Natural pressure release generally takes between 15 and 20 minutes.Quick pressure release takes about a minute, plus the hours spent in the ER if you forget to KEEP YOUR HANDS, FACE, AND ALL OTHER BODY PARTS AWAY FROM THE STEAM VALVE WHEN YOU DO IT!!  Many people put a towel over the valve before they turn it, to help suppress the steam, which you may want to do (I don't because then I just end up with a scalding hot towel - but I also rarely need to do QR, and those times that I do, I'm sufficiently respectful of the power and heat of that steam to keep my distance).Finally, in my experience, unless you are doing a ""dump everything in at once and turn it on"" recipe, you will definitely want to have all of your ingredients ready to go before you start cooking.  For example, for any recipe that includes sautéing in the pot first, then adding ingredients and then starting pressure cooking, you definitely want to have everything lined up before you start.Oh, wait, *this* is actually the final note:  the stainless steel inner pot can take a real beating, and cleans up just fine..BUT...after the first use or so (it was after my first use) you will see little ""stains"" (not sure what else to call them) and, if you are anything like me, you will think ""Oh no! I have ruined the beauty of this pot! How can I fix it?"" It turns out that this is *very* normal (at least the 'staining', not sure about my reaction being normal :-) ). In my case I had made beans, and my pot now still bears the ""imprints"" of beans, even though it is completely clean..it's sort of like the chalk outlines from a little bean murder scene. ;-) I'm in an Instant Pot forum on Facebook where many IP cookbook authors are members (including JL Fields and Jill Nussinow) and they have all said that this is perfectly normal and just what happens (in fact they said it in response to my ""Oh no, I've ruined my beautiful pot"" post).Ok, I think that those are about all of the things that I had wished that I had fully understood on my first day with my Instant Pot.Oh, actually there's one more thing.  I didn't fully appreciate, until several days in, just how amazing this aspect of the Instant Pot is: you can start something cooking in it, and then *walk away* - even leave the house, and it will finish cooking just like you instructed, and be *perfectly done*, and then it will *keep it warm for up to 10 hours*!  Not keep cooking it, just *keep it warm*.  For up to 10 hours!  You can put something in there in the morning, leave for the day, and come back to a perfectly cooked whatever, just waiting for you!  Booyah!  (I think this is the thing that pressure cooker purists who try to talk people out of getting an Instant Pot, rather than a stovetop pressure cooker, fail to understand.  You can't just walk away from a stovetop pressure cooker after the stuff starts cooking.)Now, here are the *the best* accessories (in my opinion) that you will want for your Instant Pot.You definitely will want 

  
this steamer basket









  
  
    
   for your Instant Pot (the Instant Pot comes with a little steaming trivet, but this steamer basket is *way* more useful - in fact it's how you make both poached eggs and baked potatoes).  Actually you will want *a* steamer basket, but trust me, this is the one you want, both because of the big handle, the fact that the handle telescopes, and, most importantly, you can use it with or without the little legs flipped down, and when you flip the little legs down, they give you plenty of space for as much water for steaming as you could ever need without worrying about the water touching the food that's in the basket.Or, instead of, or in addition to, the above steamer, you can get 

  
this steamer basket and steaming rack / trivet set









  
  
    
  .  The legs on this trivet are an inch and a half high (the rack that comes with your Instant Pot only gives 3/4 of an inch of clearance). and the flat-bottomed steamer is very versatile.Personally, I have both, as they each serve their own purpose, and the trivet that comes with the set is really useful for pot-in-pot cooking, at which you may also want to try  your hand.  Pot-in-pot (or ""PIP"") is where you put a second, smaller vessel inside your Instant Pot's main internal pot.  There are different reasons for doing this, ranging from ""I only want to cook a small amount of something like oatmeal"" to ""I want to cook a cheesecake in my Instant Pot"" to ""I want to cook two different things at the same time in my Instant Pot (like cooking beans, and having a bowl of rice on a trivet (see why you want a good trivet?) above the beans, steam cooking at the same time).For pot-in-pot cooking, I recommend any stainless steel vessel that is no greater in diameter than 7.5 inches, and no taller than 4 or so inches (your internal pot has a diameter of just over 8.5 inches and a height of about 6 inches).  Lots of people use glass vessels such as Pyrex or Corningware, but I personally prefer to use stainless steel because if you drop it you'll just have a mess, rather than a mess plus broken glass.If you're really keen on making cheesecakes, steamed puddings, flans, and that sort of thing in your Instant Pot, you may also want to grab this  stainless steel

   that is sold by the Instant Pot people.  This lid fits on your *inner metal pot*, and this way when you are using your Instant Pot for *non-pressurized* cooking, such as when using it as a slow cooker, or with the sauté function, you will be able to see what is going on in there.  Basically, in these usages, you can think of your Instant Pot as a counter-top stove burner (albeit one with really cool bells and whistles) - that may help you to understand why you want a (see-through!) lid for that inner pot.  Plus, once you are done cooking in any mode, you can use the inner pot to store the leftovers in your fridge, and use this lid to cover it.In terms of Instant Pot cookbooks to get you started, they are a relatively new genre, and a *lot* of them are only available as Kindle or other digital format books.  Personally, I like to have a physical book when it comes to cookbooks, and so I like this one...you can't go wrong with America's Test Kitchen cookbooks, and their pressure cooker cookbook is no exception:

  I also happen to be a strict vegetarian, and for vegetarian and vegan Instant Pot cooking, this book by J.L. Fields is considered the best book out there (it's pretty darned good!):

  
Vegan Pressure Cooking: Delicious Beans, Grains, and One-Pot Meals in Minutes









  
  
    
  And if you also are vegetarian or vegan, you'll appreciate the recipes in this one:

  And speaking of recipes - here is how to make those poached eggs, and baked potatoes.Poached Eggs:  Lightly grease 1 to 4 (depending on how many poached eggs you want) Pyrex custard cups with butter or oil.  Put a cup of water in the bottom of your Instant Pot, put a steamer basket or trivet in the pot (making sure that the water doesn't come over the top), and set your Pyrex cups in the steamer basket or on the trivet. I use my Oxo steamer basket for this, and I love that when they are done I can just grab the handle and pull the whole shebang out (remember the handle will be HOT, be sure to wear an oven mitt).  Use Manual setting, low pressure, for 2 to 3 minutes.  2 minutes will probably be enough unless you're at a high altitude.Baked Potatoes:  Remember how I said you could make baked potatoes in 12 minutes?  And remember how I said that the recipe times are for the time *at pressure*? ;~)  Still, even given the time to come to pressure, and to have the pressure come back down, you can have perfectly steam-baked potatoes in under half an hour, and the best part  is that you can start them, and then *walk away*! When you are ready for your potatoes, they will be perfectly done and waiting for you, even if you have abandoned them for hours!  Just put water in the bottom of your Instant Pot, flip the legs down on your Oxo steamer, put the steamer in the pot and then dump your potatoes in on top of the steamer.  Using the Manual setting, set the cooking time for 12 minutes, using high pressure.  Then walk away!  Now, because these are 'steam baked' (i.e. cooked whole over steam, but not in water), the skins will not be crisp, but these are otherwise exactly like the baked potatoes you know and love - they're great with butter, sour cream, etc.!  This works with new potatoes, and regular potatoes!Happy Instant Potting!"
1.0 out of 5 stars,MY INSTANT POT STOPPED WORKING AFTER 5 WEEKS!!!AND AMAZON WOULD NOT COVER RETURN....NIGHTMARE
1.0 out of 5 stars,"So very sad to write this review. I originally had given this item 5 stars because when it worked, it was amazing. However, it broke after 6 weeks of use. Emailed the company and they gave us instructions to take it apart to fix a wiring issue. Fixed the issue for 2 uses then broke again. My husband has done this twice now. Seriously so sad. Not a good investment."
1.0 out of 5 stars,Yes like everyone else I went by the reviews and ordered this item. It was great when I started using it. We are an indian family and you know how much we like eating rice :) I actually recommended it to lot of my friends and 3-4 of them bought it as well. Happy times ended soon!It only lasted for few months :( I started getting C6 error on the panel and it stopped working. I made several attempts to call customer service. And to my surprise there is no response or even acknowledgement! wow how can a great company which built such a good product have a horrible support ? I mean if you dont even care about customers who genuinely bought your product ...then please clearly call it out on your packaging!we dont want to buy your products anymore if you are not standing by it as per the gaurantee! I hope some from support looks at this and makes an attempt to reach out!
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Day one with the new toy... Chuck roast, baby carrots, fresh thyme, rosemary and garlic, a whole onion, beef broth, salt and pepper... Seared both sides for about 5 minutes on the saute setting, then used the meat setting for 65 minutes. The meat literally fell apart as I was pulling it out of the pot. A huge hit on it's first run, we have a bone-in leg of lamb thawing out now for tomorrow night.This was supposed to be a Christmas present for my wife, but she passed away a month ago. Instead it is a way for us to remember how much she would have loved it."
1.0 out of 5 stars,"I've been an Instant Pot owner and user since the first ones were offered for sale in ~2014.  We really liked our first IP but we replaced it in 2015 when the Duo model was introduced in order to take advantage of some of its new features.  That IP lasted for two years and we used it a lot, both as a pressure cooker and as a slow cooker.  In September 2017 our Duo failed and we replaced it with the then current model which was known as V2 (version 2).It didn't take very long for us to realize that something was wrong with our V2 Duo because it couldn't Slow Cook.  It would try but the temperature of the liquid in the pot was in the 150-160 degree range rather than 180-200 range.  After discussion with IP customer service, the pot was replaced with a new V3 model in January.Unfortunately, the V3 IP appears to have the same or worse problems as did the V2 it replaced.  Our efforts to use it as a pressure cooker have resulted in ""Burn"" warnings for recipes we've used for years without problems.  Unfortunately, it also appears to be useless as a slow cooker.  Today I nearly ruined a simple pot roast because after 3 hours the slow cook function stopped heating even though the control panel showed that operations were normal.I'm sure that the folks at IP will offer me a new pot; frankly, at this point I just want my money back. In the past 6 months I've ruined quite a few dinners because of cooking failures.  This is totally unacceptable and I hate to have to hover over my cooking utensil to ensure that it is working correctly.  If I can get my money back I'm going to buy a Breville.  Yes, it costs more but in this case I think you may well get what you pay for!"
1.0 out of 5 stars,"I just ordered this and received it yesterday.  So excited.  Started going through the manual set up process and as soon as we plugged it in, it starts flashing and beeping and we get an error code ""C6L"" (faulty low pressure sensor) which apparently means it's a piece of crap right out of the box.  How did this pass quality control?  The ""QC passed"" sticker on the bottom is an obvious lie.  I had to open a ticket with instant pot and waiting on their technician to tell us what to do.UPDATE:  2 days since we received our defective pot and no response from customer service.  what a waste.  DO NOT BUYUPDATE 2:  It has been a full week and we still don't have a new base.  We finally heard from customer service last Friday, a full 3 days after submitting our ticket.  We were told a new base would be sent to use because the error can't be fixed.  I was assured a new base would be sent to use and we should keep the other parts from the original one.  I expected the new base to be shipped yesterday but it was not.  I emailed customer service again and was told there's  ""a slight delay in fulfilling our warranty shipments"".  I should have just returned it to amazon and gotten another one.  What a waste.  Do not buy!UPDATE 3:  Now nine days after the faulty cooker arrived.  Emailed customer service again asking why the new base hasn't been shipped.  Just got a reply that ""Currently these bases are out of stock. They will be available by the end of next week and shipped out as soon as possible the week after.""  I am livid.  I should have just returned it.  I hate instant pot.Update 4:  Returned the pot to amazon and was sent a brand new one that arrived today.  Lesson learned: if your product dies before 30 days, just return to amazon.  Don't try to use their crappy customer service until you have to.  And even then, good luck getting anywhere with it.  They wanted me to wait 3 full weeks to get a new base.  Tried the initial setup on the new one and so far, it seems to be working.  I'm pretty sure it will die again because these things do not seem well made at all.  They didn't even want me to return the faulty one which either means 1) they know its so cheap that it's not worth fixing it and/or 2) they are so overwhelmed with issues that they don't have time to figure out what went wrong."
1.0 out of 5 stars,"At first, this product worked well. However, after a few months, the lid began to malfunction. The pressure value no longer floated up correctly. Thus the pressure cooking feature became useless and my food began to leave a burned residue on the bottom of the pot.I have contacted the Instant Pot customer service department twelve days ago, but have not received an answer or resolution to this problem.It seems to me that the Instant Pot should last and continue to function well more than a mere three months."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"My husband doesn't like leftovers. Being a stand up guy for 50 years I figure he's worth the indulgence. This makes just the right amount for us without waste. I have the larger unit when I must cook for more people, but this is my most frequently used small appliance."
1.0 out of 5 stars,"I own 3 Instant Pots, including this DUO80.  The pot has been defective since I unboxed it.  It failed the initial water test by displaying the ""burn"" message.  Customer service at Instant Pot has consistently taken the position that I, a Chef of over 40 years, don't know ow to cook rather than admitting that I have received a defective device.  They even went so far as telling me that I purchased the product from an ""inauthentic"" seller (Amazon), and that they would honor the warranty as a ""one time courtesy"". When I asked them for the contact information for the regulatory agency in Canada that is responsible for oversight of their industry, they have been silent.  No response to my email request. Fortunately, Amazon has stepped up to the plate and said that they would replace the product since the manufacturer has failed to live up to their responsibility.  Amazon is WONDERFUL!!!  That's why we purchase several thousands of dollars of products per year through them.  Amazon rocks!  Instant Pot has gone from a company with superior products and outstanding service to an entity that doesn't deserve to remain in business.  Unreliable products and very poor customer service.  They have been totally unresponsive to emails sent to sales and marketing. I use 3 Instant Pots simultaneously in my day-to-day meal preparation. When it comes time for replacement of these units, I will certainly be looking at other manufacturers because I cannot trust Instant Pot to provide quality products and honest customer service.  Buyer beware!"
1.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought this based on reviews and ""What's the best pressure cooker of 2016"" websites all saying this is the best. Well it came today and I will be contacting Amazon for a return NOT an exchange. This passed the steam test the manual recommends you do but as soon as you add food it doesn't come to pressure and just starts counting down. I not see other reviews stating the same issue and wish I read more of them before ordering. Please keep in mind I AM NOT a pressure cooker noob, I own 2 others and have no issue with them. For the money and the amount of reviews I am soooooooooooo disappointed.Hope this helps someone who is about to blow $160 on this thing, don't do it."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"One hundred percent worth it. Bought it thinking it may not work - nah. Comes with all the info and accessories you need, used it the first night for frozen fries and came out tasting like a restaurant. You won’t regret it.By the way heard it doesn’t work with the 8 qt, just FYI"
1.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought this cooker for my wife a little more than 1 year ago. We had good luck with the first one and based on that experience purchased 4 additional cookers as gifts for family members. Two of the 4 gift units we purchased stopped working inside of 5 months and the manufacturer is not honoring the warranty. After having you jump through hoops sending electronic photos and receipts they assign a ""ticket number"" via an email that also says someone will be getting back to you. Except they never do no matter how many times you follow up. It's clear that their strategy is to simply ignore you until you give up and go away. With a few minutes research it easy to verify that there are hundreds of complaints regarding this company and their refusal to honor warranties. Wake up Amazon. Unethical companies should not be allowed to continue selling on your site."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This product is my best friend and I would marry it and grow old with it if I could.  I’ve put pork loins, potatoes, yellow bundt cakes from boxed cake, rice, corn on the cob (look up INSTANT POT MILK CORN ON COB & you will never eat it any other way again!!!)... I’ve made piergoies, lasagna, apple dump cake, a whole chicken, bone broth, chicken noodle soup... and more.  This is all in less than a month.  I’m eating heathlier.  Eating out less. Cleanup is easy.  The food tastes awesome. The pork loin never dried out after it sat on the serving tray.I suggest getting the Nordic bundt pan (SMALL) multi color, extra seal rings (1 for savory, 1 for sweet)... a large steamer basket RSVP Edurance Stainless steel steamer basket wide rim 8 inch mesh basket 3 quart capacity ...And then,snap off the handles when you get it & read the reviews under it to make sure it’ll fit your new IP, kitchen towels to throw over the release valve, a 7inch springform pan (not the silicone one!!)... and a “HIC porcelain soufflé 8 inch” to make a 2 person lasagna in.  Also, A good pair of tongs."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"If you are on the fence about buying this, I say, “BUY!!”  Got mine last night & made WW air fry donuts this morning. So easy & Yummy!!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have used it three times since receiving it and am about to use it again. I had a cheap (huge) separate air fryer before. Everything had to be single layer, turned repeatedly. For my family of 5 that meant anything I cooked took over an hour. This one things can be in their together as long as you flip them around some. The ability to first pressure cook and then air fryer is awesome for chicken. I just generally love it. The instant pot was already my favorite kitchen device and this lid makes it even better."
1.0 out of 5 stars,"This is the second one that has died on me, I'm trying to do something in the instant pot and it all of a sudden stops working stops functioning I'm taking this one back as well I already had one that I took back."
1.0 out of 5 stars,"We loved this at first  but after about a month of use we are having problems with the lid sealing properly.  We always put the lid on the same way, according to the manual instructions, and this has now happened twice.  The problem is that the lid appears to be truly sealed, but after the unit gets hot, steam starts pouring out of the top lid sealing component.  When the cycle is eventually finished and we open the pot, the water inside is completely gone (and yes we are using the proper amount of water) and the bottom of the pot is all burned and brown.  Today a simple batch of har boiled eggs resulted in this and an egg explosion inside the pot.  We have only had it a little more than a month.  The Amazon return window appears to be over and we are at a loss for what to do with this now.  This is pretty much a disaster."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"My wife and I have held off trying an Instant Pot primarily because of the somewhat hyperbolic reviews we've seen on the internet.  If I am to believe the internet (a tenuous proposition to begin with), as soon as we owned an Instant Pot, our entire world would improve - from better dental hygiene to more confidence in job interviews.  I'd win friends and influence enemies.  My bowling score would be way up and my mini golf score would be way down.  It all sounded a little too good to be true.But...when the rice cooker died, there happened to be a really good sale going on with Instant Pots, so we splurged.  A typical rice cooker would likely have cost half an Instant Pot, but hey, who doesn't want lower mini golf scores?  It was worth trying.  I have yet to go to the dentist since we got the Instant Pot, but I can report that this thing is pretty darn amazing.  The rice it makes is fabulous.  Potatoes are cooked in 15 minutes.  We don't need to soak beans overnight because this thing can cook them right out of the bag.  Things that we wouldn't typically cook because they are time- and effort-intensive are well within reach on a weeknight.  We are converts.The Instant Pot seems to be well-built.  For what it's worth, since it is a pressure cooker, it really needs to be well-built if the company expects not to be hit with a lawsuit.  This thing can boil water in no time, however.  I'm not sure how it can heat that quickly.  My first guess is that it's sucking mass from the nearest star, but as I stated above, we can make potato soup - start to finish - in about 30 minutes.  Two cups of dry brown rice is ready to eat in less time than that.  We have not tried it as a slow cooker, since we don't eat many dishes well-suited to slow cooking, but I have little doubt this would do it.  Now we need to buy one of those books with vegetarian Instant Pot dishes in it.  I'm actually excited about trying new things in the Instant Pot."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"I like the product however, I have just opened a ticket with customer support regarding a defective weld in the inner lid which holds the sealing ring. I used the pot approximately three times and the last time I used it I noticed the defect while cleaning the inner sealing ring.  I am concerned that not sealing properly will create a safety hazard. I will update review when I hear from customer service.Update: 1/22/18, Customer service did take care of my issue and mailed a new lid. Credit where credit is due. Just be aware that opening a ticket with customer support requires you to jump through a few hoops. Apparently the Amazon order number for this product is not enough documentation that you purchased it. Customer service requires you to send a copy of your invoice and pictures of various affixed labels on the pot and a picture of the problem which is a reasonable request.  Also there are a ton of recipes on the internet and how to videos  on how to use the Instant Pot DUO, just in case you are someone who does not want to carefully read the instructionmanual."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Alright, y'all. So after much deliberation, I ordered an Instant Pot last Monday.I was hesitant because I'd recently purchased a Dutch oven and a sous vide immersion circulator and three different blenders before deciding that I should probably stop buying kitchen appliances considering I hardly even cook and generally consume most of my meals in a nutrient sludge meal replacement (that plug will have to wait for another day). But ultimately my unbridled consumerism and constant hunger for new gadgets won out (they always do in the end) and before I knew it, I had a 6-quart Instant Pot 9-in-1 DUO Plus sitting on my counter.Being that it was 11pm on a Wednesday night by this point, I decided I would wait until the next day to try out my new toy.But being that I was extremely hungry for both food and instant gratification, I immediately changed my mind and brought out a chuck roast I had been thawing for this very occasion.This was the test, you see. The electronic, pressurized crucible. Could this shiny, button-covered cylinder the size of a large rice cooker make a pot roast faster than my slow cooker? Surely it couldn't make it as *well*, but could it get at least 85% of the way there in a fraction of the time?Turned out the answer was a resounding ""yes"". In fact, the meat was exactly the way I like it, tender but still slightly firm. Easily pulled apart, but not yet a tasteless mush. And the whole process took about an hour and a half, including the time it took to brown the roast and pressurize/depressurize the pot.From that moment, I was completely sold. See, the problem I had with even just a pot roast in a slow cooker was that I always ended up having to plan my day around it. It wasn't enough to just dump in the ingredients and let them sit. I'd found that 6 hours was too short, but 8 hours was too long. I needed to leave it in for 7 hours, but my workday was 8 hours long, not even counting the commute. Plus I had to add in the vegetables 2-3 hours before the end so that they would cook but not have all the nutrients obliterated into a mush.Thus, pot roasts were for weekends. But even then, if I wanted a pot roast for dinner, I had to get up early and do all the prep, just to let it sit for hours while I salivated in torment. And I had to make sure I was there at the end to turn it off.The Instant Pot eliminates most of these issues. I can set a timer for when I want it to start. I can set a cook time, after which it will either turn off or go into a ""Keep Warm"" mode. I can dump ingredients in the pot in the morning (though probably not something with raw meat) and have them freshly cooked and ready to eat right when I get home at night.I made the pictured beef stew earlier and cooking only took about an hour. Without a pressure cooker, it would have taken several hours. I'm seriously considering bringing this thing to work and just cooking my lunch there. I mean, why not? Assuming I have ingredients prepared, making a meal in this would be easier than making a sandwich.I've only made two things in it so far, but I'm already really digging this thing. Four years ago, I bought a slow cooker and it was probably the best thing I'd ever bought myself up to that point. My Instant Pot is shaping up to take up that mantle.There's a lot of hype around the Instant Pot. People describe it as ""magic"". It's not magic-- it's food science. But when you can reduce a several-hour cook time down to about an hour, is there really a difference?(Note: I realize this review, especially that last paragraph, probably sounds like I'm some paid, professional reviewer, but I assure you I am neither paid nor professional; I just really dig this thing and I'm a decent writer. Not that I would turn down a company who wants to send me free stuff to give my honest opinion on! ;) )"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Ohhhh wow! I originally bought the IP 6 quart Lux, and liked that pretty well, but had wished that I had done more research and gotten the IP DUO Plus... so I got on Amazon and ordered it I believe Christmas Day, and it was supposed to arrive Tuesday January 2nd... Got a message today (December 29th) that it was being delivered... had planned on making soup in my Lux, but held out for my Duo Plus to be delivered... first off, I think there may have been something wrong with my Lux, it took forever to heat up and released lots of steam (and yes I had the vent closed)... it seemed to cook ok, but my DUO is a dream! It has a big bright display, lights that let you know where you are in the cooking process, and way more features. Also love that you can change the pressure from low to high... you have no idea how long it took me to figure out the Lux only cooked on high! Kept seeing these recipes that would say “cook on High pressure” but didn’t know if I was or not?!?Needless to say I’m very happy with my new IP DUO Plus and shipping was so fast, 5 Days early!!!"
3.0 out of 5 stars,"I really can't say anything terrible about the pot.  Its a pressure cooker and a slow cooker, but they try to sell it as so much more.  Most of the functions and buttons on here are superfluous.  And the worst part as a chef, is that it takes away a lot of the control you have over cooking.  My first stew in there was a disaster...veggies turned to mush...and the lid was pressure locked so there was no way for me to get them out. With a traditional pressure cooker you have the option of running cold water over the lid and using a quick release method in those cases.My other issue is that it takes a LONG time to come to pressure. My regular, stove top pressure cooker (Kuhn Rikon) takes between 5-7 minutes generally to come to pressure. This one can take as long as 15-17 minutes, and even longer if anything is frozen inside.  That means that food is rapidly boiling/cooking before the pressure timer even starts. And then you have to also adjust for the amount of time your food is just locked away ....boiling/cooking away long after the pressure timer is over.All in all, people are raving about these pots, and the one thing I do love about it - is that I can set something in there and forget about it if its something like dried beans or rice on the rice setting.  Just add ingredients, click the lid, push a button and walk away. Thats a great function for busy moms I'm sure.I'm a chef, so of course I can figure out how to use any cooking device/tool and make something delicious.  But ultimately, I like to have more control of my food and the outcome! :)"
1.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought one Instant Pot DUO Plus 6 Qt 9-in-1 from Amazon on Nov. 27. I found something terribly wrong with the product. Yesterday, I cooked white rice using high pressure. I left the rice in the pot about 10 hours. By the time I tried to serve the rice, I noticed that the bottom part turned to chromium/slate color. It is obvious that the color is coming from the material of inner pot.  I have reported the issue to the manufacturer but I also would like to encourage other buyers to check this out. Food safety is most important."
1.0 out of 5 stars,"The model I received is an original version, not a 3rd generation of the 8-quart Instant Pot.There is no such thing as a 3rd generation DUO 80 I found out. None. Due to an error on Instant Pot's website and copied by Amazon, it was advertised as a 3rd generation on Prime Day. I can't blame Amazon because they trusted the manufacturer's description..All 8 qt models as of this writing are the same. They have attached cords and lack other programmability features found on new, smaller models. I noticed this right out of the box when I saw that the power cord was hard-wired rather than the removable cord advertised in the product description. If that were the only difference in this old model and the current models, I could handle that. Unfortunately, the 8 quart models do not have the same programmability functions as the 3rd generation models found in 6 qt designs. If you want to know the differences, do a search on the instant pot website.I returned it in favor of another 8 qt. brand that is more modern in every way and I'll keep my 6 qt.

   I received the Instant Pot (8Qt) as a birthday gift and really only used it to cook rice in bulk (it does a wonderful job). Recently I decided to try cooking beans in there, to discover that the Pot has a defective option for beans. Fortunately it is covered by a one year warranty, unfortunately that means I have to deal with their less than stellar customer service and I am currently still stuck with the effective product. All in all, the product works well when it works. If you purchase their product make sure the first thing you do is go through and try every option on the product, it would be unfortunate to discover a defect once the warranty has expired. (Also I apologize for filming in the vertical position, I figured their would be dead space if I recorded in the landscape position)."
1.0 out of 5 stars,We used it 8 times and it died. And now it's too late to return. Terrible product.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I didn't want to like the Instant Pot because it seemed like such a fad/trend, but... I am now one of its biggest promoters. I LOVE this thing. I think that I've only used my stove and oven a couple of times since I got an IP. I had the 6-quart at first and when I realized how much I was using it and needed a bigger one, I got the 8-quart and gave the 6 to my SIL for Christmas.PROS:You can cook almost anything in it. So far, I've done chicken breasts and wings, burgers, collard greens, turkey breast (for Thanksgiving), and a yogurt cheesecake. INo heating up the kitchen (in the summer, this will be really important)Less cleanup (Basically it's just what you fit into the IP)Easily moved and stored out of the wayAttractive to look at and you won't mind leaving it on your counters (if you have the room)Quiet operation.Has a Delay Start button. I find this perfect for most days. It's like that old saying of  ""set it and forget it"".CONS:The Steam button confuses every new user. If it's up, you don't want to open it. (** On the 8-qt model the button stand way high out of the hole when cooking.  I have attached photos showing the button positions on the *8 Quart model ONLY*)You will most likely need more accessories. I got a set of Pot-in-Pot pans and still would like to have more IP items.Can be awkward to remove foods/pans from the pot. Most people have learned to make slings out of foil or string.The steam release can be confusing & scary to new users. Basically ""quick release"" is using something to lift the steam nozzle to let the steam shoot out fast until the button pops down. ""Slow Release"" is when you just let the food sit for a while when it's finished cooking. I do this when I am cooking ahead of time. The main thing is to learn what position the button needs to be in on your model before you attempt to remove the lid.It does not brown or crisp foods. You can get some result on some foods using the Saute function but using the oven or air fryer to finish is bestLike most people, I didn't even use my IP for a few days after getting it because I was so scared of the thing. I joined a Facebook group and did a lot of online research before I finally took a chance. Now that I've used the IP, I can't imagine being without it.A couple of notes I wish I'd known before:1. The difference in size is important. I started with a 6-qt and moved up to the 8-qt and I'm cooking mainly for oneThis is a great photo showing the difference in sizes is courtesy online of ""Mama Shire""2. Do make notes of temps and times for things you cook. I put my notes in my cookbook and a copy on the fridge. Not everyone else's times and temps worked for me.3. You can use the handle of a wooden spoon or something to do a quick steam release.4. For some reason, I need to use more seasonings when cooking in the IP with the lid on. That, or adding a little oil on top of seasonings seems to help.5. There are recipes for cakes and bread, etc online. Take time to experiment and don't just stick to the pressure cooking button.6. For browning some foods, the Saute function is really useful.7. If you preheat IP with the Saute function while prepping food, the machine gets ready faster when you start to cook.8. That Steam/Vent switch is not meant to be tight as I thought it should be. I thought mine was broken because it was so loose. Nope. It's just like that. You simply turn the thing toward Steam when getting ready to cook/pressurize. When done, if you want to do a  quick release and open the pot, that is when you use something to lift the switch to let the steam escape. Or you can just wait until it finishes releasing on its one and the nozzle drops back into place."
2.0 out of 5 stars,"I have two main issues with the air fryer lid.  1.  Everything I've made so far sticks to the bottom of the air fryer basket and the tray.  I've made potatoes, homemade french fries (twice) and bagels.  All of these stuck and made it difficult to turn the food.  It was also a pain to clean.  2.  The basket is small but it has a tray.  I thought this was great, but the food on the bottom of the basket didn't cook and get brown like the food on the tray did so we had to keep cooking the food on the bottom.  It's also hard to turn the food on the bottom with the tray in.  I thought this would be great to replace our big air fryer, but I can't get behind it."
1.0 out of 5 stars,"We were excited to jump on the ""Instant Pot"" bandwagon. When the Instant Pot first arrived, we prepared several items and were happy with the results. It truly was a remarkable product...then, just 31 days after we received it...and with probably only 12 times of actual use, the Instant Pot malfunctioned and displayed a C6L code along with a bunch of flashing lights and beeping. I unplugged the pot and waited unto the next morning to see what button or combination of steps that needed to be done to get the IP back up and working. After trying several things, that didn't work, I decided to Google the issue and see if others had the same problem...It was then that I found out that the dreaded C code was a ""fatal"" error in the machine and that it was not repairable. I was given a link to the IP customer service and the support area. Was told to photograph the serial number, error code, Model sticker, and my receipt (from Amazon). I did all of the 6 days ago (4 Business days) and I have still not head back from the company. Which leads me to believe that there are far more people with catastrophic problems with their Instant Pot than me....Do NOT buy this product! We took very good care of this machine and NEVER overloaded or overused it. Most of the food we cooked in the IP was for less than 5 minutes each time. It does not hold up and the company is super slow (still waiting) to respond to issues. Save your money and your time! Don't purchase!"

If I had any common sense I’d throw it in the trash.  I’ll keep trying even though I’ve lost hope.  If I find a sliver of success I’ll update here.  I paid close to $80 for this misery."
1.0 out of 5 stars,"I ordered this item on July 10. As of Aug 27, it no longer works, won't turn on at all.....It seems that for the price, it should last longer than 6 weeks. Amazon says I can't return it because it's been longer than a month!!! Can this be true?????"
1.0 out of 5 stars,"Love this product BUT I didn't get everything that I was supposed to get in the box...which was pretty disappointing.  I called Instant Pot customer service and they mailed me the little condensation cup that was missing *no cost of course* and then I was a happy camper. Then, I realized a few days later that I was supposed to have gotten a rice cup and a metal rack as well! I still had the box, so I double, triple, checked AGAIN, but I already knew these items weren't in there. I looked on the box and these are listed on there as supposed to be included. I didn't call customer service back, though. I'll just count it as a loss and lesson learned for being too excited at first and not taking the time to check everything before unboxing and using. Just be wary---but definitely BUY! This is an absolute amazing product and has cut down cooking and cleaning time so much."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love this appliance but be warned, the 8qt one is pretty big. See the pic of it I uploaded next to my rice cooker. It dwarves my air fryer too. I got the 8qt because the 6qt was out of stock and I didn't want to wait ""one or two months"". I figured the extra size would give me flexibility to make more stuff while still being able to do small quantities. While that's true, it takes longer to get to pressure and it takes up quite a bit of counter space.. Kinda wish I'd waited now to get the 6qt."
1.0 out of 5 stars,lid dropped and broke with cheap plastic coating. Manufacture and insurance both denied the claim. Lid cost more that the product itself. Amazon its terrible that you would put up with these type of companies.
2.0 out of 5 stars,I have had my Instant Pot for just a few weeks shy of a year and really have enjoyed many good meals.  I have used it about a dozen times.  It just died.  I prepared my food as usual and turned it on (slow cooker setting which I always use) and left the room for only a minute when I heard it sizzling away.  Came back to find it smoking from just about everywhere.  I yanked the plug.....and was thankful I didn't leave the house.  It's now in the trash.  So just beware of leaving it unattended.  I will not be replacing it.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This was a good purchase. Especially for meal prepping. The instruction manual is pretty good, but I recommend you watch a youtube video on the product and how to use it. This is a game changer for those that are short on time due to busy schedules."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Updated 12/9/2018Still going strong, still using the heck out of it.  Made a cheesecake last night after I cooked a corned beef!  Glad to have two different color sealing rings so the cake doesn't smell like corned beef.  The Instant Pot folks have a two pack of rings, red and blue, quite handy.  I use red for everyday and blue for sweets.  I also finally broke down and bought a steamer basket with a handle, works better than the one I mention below.Updated: 9/26/2017I’ve had my Instant Pot (IP) going on two years; I bought it on Black Friday 2015. I am still as enthusiastic about it now as I was when I bought it, but I don’t use it as much anymore. I use it a few times a week mainly for side dishes or one pot meals. I love it for steaming vegetables, easy peeling hard boiled eggs, creamy risotto, and it makes a mean mac’n’cheese!  Lots of one pot meals like chili, sausage and peppers, butter chicken, even ziti spaghetti.  Super for soups.  I love, love, love making an Olive Garden copycat Zuppa Toscana in it.It’s not Instant Cooking... it takes time to get to pressure, add the actual cooking time, and then a cool-down (or natural release) period.  Your recipe might state a cook time of 30 minutes but it doesn’t mention the 10-20 minutes it takes to get to pressure and the 10-15 minutes it might need for a natural pressure release.  Be sure to factor that in so your family isn’t waiting at the table 30 minutes before your dinner is ready.  You’ll know what ‘hangry’ means then!There is definitely a learning curve with this cooker. Pressure cooking is dependent on density – and you’ll see that in the charts that the Instant Pot company has on it’s website; something cut into chunks will cook faster than a big solid piece.  I think the hardest thing to learn to cook in the IP is meat. I pretty gave up on roasts.  It just takes practice and patience.I recommend using recipes when you are learning how to use your IP. There are great free recipes online, some of my favorite websites are Pressure Cooking Today, This Old Gal, and Dad Cooks Dinner. Instant Pot also has a company sponsored Facebook group that posts recipes and is a good place to learn about your pot.I love that I can cook pot-in-pot, in winter I put steel-cut oats with all my add-ins (raisins, vanilla, cinnamon, almond milk) into a small stainless-steel bowl, set that on the included trivet, throw a cup of water in the bottom of the IP, set it for 5 minutes manual pressure and then go get ready for work.  By the time I’m done, it’s cooked, depressurized, and so yummy.  Way easier to clean a little bowl too.  The recipe for that comes with the IP.I rarely use my Instant Pot as a slow cooker, I have found that most everything I cooked in my slow cooker can be cooked at pressure. The pea soup I cooked all day in the slow cooker took an hour in the IP (15 min to come to pressure, 30 minutes on the Soup setting, 15 min natural release) and tasted just as good. I can do a corned beef in 90 minutes (plus that extra half hour I mentioned above).  If you do use it as a slow cooker, please know that the low setting on the IP is equivalent to ‘stay warm’ on your slow cooker. It also only heats from the bottom not the sides like a traditional slow cooker.  That hasn’t seemed to make a difference from what I can tell though.Now to some specific tips:Getting the lid on properly: The instructions say to line up the arrows to get the lid aligned with the pot before you close it and seal the vent. The arrows are really hard to see and honestly, you don’t need them. Don’t bother painting them white like some folks suggest.  Instead, learn this: at the back of the Instant Pot is a black ‘ledge’ that the lid fits onto, the lid then slides to the right to close it. Put the lid on with the sealing mechanism at that point.  It will make sense when you start to use it. Look from above when you put the lid on and you’ll see what I’m talking about. Kind hard to explain, see the 3rd photo below.Accessories: My sealing ring lasted nearly a year. Towards the end of the 10th month it had stretched out so much that the only way to have it stay inside the lid was to freeze it. Although it worked, it’s not the best thing to do. I keep two rings on hand now, one for sweets and one for savory. The rings DO pick up odors and you don’t want a green curry smell on your custard. They are relatively inexpensive so buy one with your IP order.I use the

   for a steamer basket. I did pry the riveted handles off but if I was to do it again I would bend them upwards in a vise. It’s hard to get this basket out of the pot without handles. I bought a pot lifter (see last photo) but it didn’t work well – it is designed to lift from the outside of a pot, not the inside.  Now I just put my silicone mitts on and pick the basket up.  That said, I am very happy with the basket. It can hold 5 lbs. of diced potatoes with a few raw eggs balanced on top (which by the way can be cooked together for 4 minutes on high pressure, quick release, for a great potato salad base– don’t forget to put one cup of water into the bottom of the pot though).I use these style silicone mitts when handling the inner pot.

  . The inner pot (stainless steel liner) spins when you stir food. I had tried binder clips to hold it in place when I stirred but it’s just easier to hold the pot while wearing one of these. Lots of recipes call for stirring something in at the end, or sauteing something at the beginning, and the spinning is just annoying. As mentioned above, the mitts are great for taking the hot stainless-steel liner out of the pot. Highly recommend.I resisted the lure of the cheesecake for about 10 months then I finally succumbed. Way too many pictures of IP cheesecakes on Facebook. Pretty much anything that can be cooked bain-marie style can be done in the IP (think custard, crème brulee).  I bought the

   which works great. Some people like push pans. The only thing I can say about this is that a 6” cheesecake has a few less calories than a 9” one. The IP makes cheesecakes a breeze to cook. Beware.Two last things 1) This cannot be used for canning. Electric pressure cookers do not come up to a high enough pressure to safely can food. They also don’t maintain a steady heat, they have on/off heat cycles.  You need a stovetop pressure canner to be safe. 2) Don't be scared of this thing - it has lots of safety features. As long as you follow the directions you will be fine. Never force the lid off - it slides easily when pressure is gone. Open the lid away from you so any residual steam is blocked by the lid. Use common sense and you will be just fine!This is a great purchase – you’ll love it!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased one for myself and love it so much that I purchased this one for my son. But he had already bought one for himself. I'm not sad, it means I have 2. With the holidays coming up I'm sure both will be very useful. I've always wanted a pressure cooker but was afraid of them. With all the safety features the Instant Pot has I'm not afraid to use it. Hard boiled eggs, rice, stews, chicken, veggies - all have come out fabulous!It's best to do some research to learn how to use it at first. There is a very helpful Fb group should you have any questions."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"I just received it yesterday Jan 19, 2020. It looks like a quality product, just like my Instant Pot Ultra. I glanced at the instructions and then YouTube and cooked sweet potatoes fries. It was easy to use and the fries were delicious.Having said that, this is probably not the optimal approach to ""air frying"".Why do I say that?I usually do more research than this time before I order a product. Instead, this time, it was an impulse purchase after having read somewhere that Instant Pot had announced it recently, based on my excellent experience with Instant Pot Ultra and a quick glance at the positive reviews in Amazon about this lid. However, once I got it, it “hit me” that this is just a half-appliance and that between the lid and its accessories, it occupies as much space in my kitchen or cabinets as a full air fryer; it costs as much as a typical air-fryer, and I can't use it simultaneously with my ""Instant Pot"". So, it might be better to buy a stand-alone air fryer."

4.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought this for my wife who is slowly learning to use it. It works great. My only criticism is the lack of full instructions on how to use the various settings. The accompanying cookbook is helpful but doesn't have information on some basic things. For example, how are Ball jars sterilized? Do they go in the pot upside down or right side up? How is plain white rice cooked? What is the water to rice ratio needed?  It appears that trial and error is required. The instructions contain information on what each programmed button does but not how to use them."
1.0 out of 5 stars,"The documentation and user material provided is inadequate, incomplete and makes the Airfryer Lid unusable. There are no recipes in the Getting Started Guide and, in fact, the User's Manual that came with my product was missing: information on the control panel; cleaning before first use; detailed instructions on how to cook with the Airfryer Lid; detailed information on smart programs and a cooking time chart. After spending 30 minutes on hold, I talked to a very pleasant customer rep who sent me a link to the ""full manual"" which contained all of the missing info, plus some that was in the ""safety, maintenance and warranty"" brochure -- but still no recipes.I know this is a new product -- all the more reason to provide complete and useful information WITH the package.If I ever figure out how to cobble together enough information to actually use the Airfryer Lid, I'll write another review."
1.0 out of 5 stars,"Slow cooker function did not work. Set up the pot and turned on—eight hours later came home to a slightly warm, raw pot roast.  Tried the function two other times while at home, and the cooker defaulted to the warm position after a short time. Had my sister in law program it also without telling her my problem—she ruined a roast also.  Very disappointed after reading so many positive reviews."
3.0 out of 5 stars,"The only reason I give this a 3 star is because it is finicky about making yogurt and bad recipe booklet. After a couple failed attempts, I discovered that it doesn't heat the milk to the necessary temperature. Hence I got syrupy sour milk instead of yogurt. The highest milk temperature I got was around 150F using the yogurt button. So I ended up having to check the temperature after it finished boiling the milk, then boiled again, and check again until it reach the temperature needed. Then chill, add yogurt culture, and then finished the cycle. What should have been a push of the button turned out to be more steps involed. I would expect their built in thermostat to do a better job of regulating the temperature. Other than that I love everything else. Brown rice turned out nicely. Stew (I tried both beef and chicken) were fast and delicious. The included recipe book (4th edition) needs major review and revision. I have not read the entire booklet, but of the 2 recipes I looked at: (1) the brown rice listed cooking time of 4min which is the same as white rice. (2) Vanilla yogurt by Maomao Mom, good luck following the instruction. I threw the booklet away after reading those 2 simple recipes. The manufacture intention of providing some simple recipes is to help users succeed while they get acquainted to this new tool. However, the bad instruction had just ensured I would fail right out of the gate. Not very good for first time users."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought this for my husband, as he does 95% of the cooking for the both of us and he likes kitchen gadgets.  He has an old-time huge steel stove-top pressure cooker that he uses on occasion, but for some reason it scares the crap out of me so I figured I would not be afraid to use the Instant Pot.  I bought the mini since it is just us.  My first try with it was a pot roast.  I bought a 2.5 lb roast, which left just enough room for the vegetables.  I followed the cooking timer table in the recipe book that came with the Instant Pot.  It said 15 minutes per lb for a roast, so I set the timer for 45 minutes just to give it a tad more time.  It actually took close to an hour and 15 minutes before it was ready, as I checked it and turned it back on, but still better than roasting it all day in the oven and heating up the house.  I then threw the vegetables in and in 10 minutes we had a great dinner!  I am looking forward to trying some different recipes and maybe coaxing my husband to use it.Pros:*Even though I bought the mini, it was larger than I thought it would be; just enough for dinner for 2 and leftovers the next day.*Super easy to clean; just throw the stainless steel pan in the dishwasher and easily wipe down the rest with a damp cloth.*Quiet!  Once you plug it in and turn it on, you can't even hear it.Cons:*Extra parts that are needed are super expensive, and some not available at all for the mini.  They could have thrown in a little steamer basket instead of a bunch of goofy plastic accessories that I won't even use.*The cord is a little short, at only 36 inches.*The steam release valve seems flimsy, but it does the job.  Just BE VERY CAREFUL when releasing the steam and don't put your hand or face anywhere near the top.  Just kind of stand back and flick it from the side."
1.0 out of 5 stars,"Returning this... Too difficult to use.  I bought it because I thought it would make quick dinners but the time it takes to come to pressure is so long I could have already made something the ""old fashioned"" way and have been done.  Tried a seafood boil and then a whole roasted chicken.  The seafood boil never came to pressure after 40 mins and the shrimp over cooked with the small amount of heat that it did produce and the chicken smelled great but had no flavor because the seasoning was on the skin that was gooey and unappetizing.  Also, the chicken, even though it was cooked through did not fall off the bone like it does when I cook it in the oven.  Sorry, I gave it a shot but could not see the value!"

1.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought one of the Instant Pot DUO60 models a few months ago. It never sealed properly, but it took me a few times to realize that it was a defective product since I didn't have any experience with pressure cookers. Their warranty support is terrible. Most companies will ask you a few questions and send you a replacement unit. Not Instant Pot! They've been emailing me for weeks, and here are some of the things they want me to do:-List the recipes I've used-Manually inspect the unit and take photos with a ruler to make sure that it is flush and not dented or warped-Run a ""quick water"" test which takes 30 minutes, record a video of it and submit it to them-Set up a separate timer and record three separate measurements of when the Instant Pot does stuff during the cycle-Take pictures of the heating element, inner pot, stickers on the unit, etc.Getting a bad unit replaced should be a straightforward process. A person shouldn't have to run a science experiment and document their results with videos and photos sent to this company. This has wasted hours of my time with an endless back-and-forth. Do yourself a favor and get a different brand of ""smart"" pressure cooker."
2.0 out of 5 stars,"So after 30 days my first IP broke, and Amazon exchanged it for me. Now, 8 months later the same issue. I turned the pot on for a rice cycle of pressure cooking, it started up fine and came back 20 min later and the LCD was dead. Checked both ends of the plug and explained this when I sent in a ticket to IP with the receipt and 4 days later got a response:If the power cord is detachable, ensure it is firmly plugged into the Instant Pot and the outlet.In an effort to troubleshoot your pot, please answer the following:- Did anything unusual happen the last time you used your Instant Pot?In addition, please send us the following:- An image displaying both the Instant Pot plugged-in and the LCD screen- An image of the heating element (with the inner pot removed)- An image of your inner pot turned upside down, with a flat object (such as a ruler) laying across the top- Place your inner pot upside down on a surface and turn it 360 degrees. Observe if the inner pot’s rim is flush with the surface- An image of any small dents or warps to the bottom of your inner potThank you, we look forward to your reply.So a standard letter and didn't read my ticket at all, fine. When I asked why they need a bunch of pictures of the inner pot,  they just replied that it was required to process the claim.  People scam companies for warranty returns all the time, I get it- but I still thought this was a bit much in that it has nothing to do with the inner pot. If there is a relationship between the electronics pad breaking and the inner pot having a dent, then be prepared to explain it, otherwise they are just hassling me and looking to weasel out of the warranty in my book.  Seeing as this is the second return I am making I am a bit peeved and not impressed with the build quality on the electronics at least. It a useful and great product when it works, but I am not going to stick with them if this keeps happening.  I do use the pot frequently but not daily, and expect it to last at least a few years especially considering  they are one of the most expensive pressure cookers on the market.Hey IP-- you aren't the only ones who make a nice pressure cooker and I can go elsewhere. I have a larger Mealthy that I love also and works flawlessly, so maybe I will just get another one of those.  Really expected better customer service or at least service that makes sense."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"Fantastic addition to the Instant Pot.  However, I find the lack of documentation frustrating.  If you have never used an air fryer, It’s not intuitive to use.  A more comprehensive users manual and some sample recipes to help get you started, would greatly improve customer satisfaction."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I already love my Instant Pot(s) - I have a 5 qt, 6 qt, and 8 qt.  I've been seeing all these people talk about about their air fryers and I just don't want another appliance to have to house in my kitchen.  Enter the Instant Pot (IP) air fry lid!Mine came in the mail this afternoon and I've already used it to air fry tater tots and chicken tenders.  Both turned out beautifully crisp and tasty.  And now the same IP is making yogurt for my family.I already use my IP to proof bread dough.  Now I can actually bake the bread in my IP instead of heating up the whole oven.I have an Excalibur dehydrator that I wouldn't want to do without, but the IP dehydrate option will be handy if I just want to do like a handful of herbs vs 9 trays of something.The accessory pieces that came with the lid are all dishwasher safe (the lid IS NOT.)  But they cleaned up super easy with a brush and soap.  They've made it almost idiot proof - the plug prevents you from plugging the base in at the same time as the lid (you only use the actual Instant Pot as a vessel to hold what you're cooking.  The lid does everything else.)  It chimes to remind you to flip food halfway through when using the air fry setting.  It doesn't get hot.  There's a piece that you use to place the lid when you're using it, but have it off the pot and that piece turns over and is used to store the lid - it locks into position and protects the inside.I also love that there's a shelf that you can use to cook a second layer of food. Very handy when you have multiple children waiting for their chicken.I love my Instant Pot products and have had zero issues with any of them.  I have very high hopes for this item as well. Two thumbs up!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased an Instant Pot Duo Nova on sale before Christmas.  I have been LOVING it.  Didn't know why I never got one before.  Then my attention went to Air Fryers.  I discovered Instant Pot had a combo 8 qt Air Fryer/Pressure Cooker but I already that the cooker part.  Bummer.  I started researching Air Fryers in the store.  For a basket this size they are HUGE.  I have a nice amount of counter space but didn't want to give any up for a big appliance.  Then a lady in the store told me Instant Pot had an AIR FRYER LID!  What!  That's Genius!  I basically has the parts the Combo Unit has,  but lid plugs in separately.  Unplug cooker part first.  The cord is longer than the cooker.  The lid has a hotplate you sit it on when taking it off to stir things and to store the lid on.  VERY EASY to use and clean.  Storage is awesome.  The fryer basket can be kept inside the pot, and make a place in a cabinet for the lid.  This is very well made and thought out  like your Instant Pot.  This will ONLY WORK with the 6 quart models as listed.  It will not fit the 8 quart model and some 6 quart models.  Make sure it will work with your Model,  I have the Duo Nova.  I cannot say enough about this.  BUY IT NOW!!!!"
1.0 out of 5 stars,Hello quality control? Looks like something chewed a giant hole all the way through 2boxes and the Insta pot is badly damaged in the same place. I can’t believe InstaPot/Amazon would ship something in this condition. Maybe it’s a sign.
5.0 out of 5 stars,I had the bigger one and I liked it so well I got the small to do veggies in I'm 80 and I'm loving the new tricks you can do in the kitchen with the instapots
5.0 out of 5 stars,"It takes about 12 minutes for this to pressure up. A tiny whiff of your concoction will fill the air as the unit switches to the countdown you set, and usually 10-20 minutes later (whatever you set), your meal will be ready to eat. You can let it take its time or nudge it using the slow release method before being able to open the pot. But it is darn fast!At first it seemed no one would ship this to Hawaii, but fortunately for me, this seller does and it arrived as promised and I have been delighting in experimentation since I started two weeks ago. I bought the 3-qt mini which gives me enough for one hungry person - sometimes I have leftovers to freeze. I can probably cook more volume than I have been but I want to be careful to not overfill the pot (2/3 is absolute limit). I needed the smaller unit for my place but if you have the space, get the 6 or 8 qt. i scour the net for recipes, then concoct my own (which doesn't always turn out). I love to saute onions first so the option to pressure, slow cook or saute is nice, you can also reheat meals and make (steamed) cake even though the mini has no cake setting. I just read some tips and may switch to using the slow cook for cakes. So far I made brownies (dry but my fault as I followed my gut instincts on ingredients), cheesecake (not bad) and (failed) cornbread. The trick on meals is finding items that require similar cook times, like my (frozen) chicken breast, thick wedge of cabbage, whole small potatoes and carrots, 17 min pressure cooked. This is keeping me eating happy and healthy, at home! And cleanup is not bad, either. The nicest thing about having one of these, is that once you get hungry and prepare your meal, you are just a quick chore (or shower or leisurely beer) away from eating -- instead of munching on unhealthy snacks while waiting an hour or more like with normal meals as you eventually spoil your appetite,"
1.0 out of 5 stars,"Bought it on Jun 01, 2016 , and now it is dead. The reason I purchased this one is because the previous one I got is dead only a little over 12month. Very bad quality."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought the 8 qt after doing a lot of research, but despite all my careful research there were some unexpected surprises. First, I was under the impression the only difference in the 6 and 8 was size. The 8 quart requires more water or liquid to reach pressure (2-2.5 cups vs. the 1-1.5 cups for the 6 qt)-- this can affect many recipes that call for only 1 cup of liquid! The 8 qt is really for cooking larger quantities, but I thought I could cook smaller portions in it too, and you can but, again, you have to add more liquid than some recipes require. You can get around this by doing PIP (pot in pot) cooking, but what a hassle if you want to sear or sauté something--you would have to do that in the inner pot, then transfer everything to the PIP smaller pot (which you have to figure out what to use and buy it), you can then add the amount of liquid to your dish, and if it is not 2 cups, then you would add 1 cup of water to the inner pot itself, so, combined you have enough liquids to reach pressure. The 8 qt, because it holds more, takes longer to release pressure naturally (and maybe a little longer with quick release, too). It is a wonderful size, and I thought it would be versatile, allowing me to cook large or small portions, but I am cooking for two and this is just too big since it requires the extra liquid. I exchanged it for a Duo60 without doing anything more than the Pressure Test. Please note, I spoke with customer service at Instant Pot because the Manual says the Pressure Test natural release time would be 15 minutes and it took 55! They said the manual has a misprint, the ""3 mark"" should read 3rd mark, not the number 3 because the 3 is 3 liters and the 3rd Mark is 3 cups, so yes, big difference. I thought the pot was defective, so was glad I called. Very nice people!! I gave the 8qt 4 stars because it is a wonderful appliance, the -1 star was for not explaining the differences better so people can make a more informed decision on which size to buy. Gotta love the ease of returns on Amazon,"
1.0 out of 5 stars,"So I opened my new instant pot, super excited to try it out, unfortunately, it was clearly not new. It smelled like food had scrub marks, watermarks, and the utensil unfortunately, it was clearly not new. It smelled like food had scrub marks, watermarks,  and the accessories were in a beat up Ziploc bag. I am so disappointed!  I can't believe they felt like this was acceptable  :-("
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've already used this twice and similarly to the convection cooker I recently purchased, this thing has me coming up with new recipes and ways to cook.First off, the time saved with this justifies the purchase alone - I can cook an entire meal in this, doing each step from start to finish in the one pot.  I've used it three times so far and in each case the prep + cook time was probably around 40% less than if I'd cooked using traditional methods - this includes clean-up too, as I'm only cleaning one pot out later on.Then there is the versatility.  Meat, poultry, baking, soups, stews, whatever - I can use it as a crock pot, use it to saute things, etc.  Last night I did a beef roast - seared the roast in the Instant Pot with some salt and garlic, added beef broth, added veggies, and then closed that sucker up to pressure cook it all.  Because the pressure cooker keeps all the flavor locked in, I used less seasoning than I normally do, letting the various food's natural flavors shine through.  The meat was tender and everything was flavorful - and because everything was done in just one pot, cleanup was simple.If there is one drawback - when pressure cooking the pot takes awhile to build up the heat and pressure.  This means that you have to factor this time into your cooking schedule - I haven't actively measured it, but it seems to be about 10~15 minutes additional time which sort of sucks if you haven't planned ahead.I'm looking forward to doing more things in it; so far just the beef roast, turkey tenderloin, and boiled eggs, but I'm impressed so far."
2.0 out of 5 stars,"I must be the only person alive NOT loving my Instant Pot.  So frustrating.  I consider myself a good cook, but thought maybe this appliance would allow me to make healthy meals that would normally take too long after work, more quickly.  Slow cooker has not cooked my beef stew recipe well at all.  Meat is overdone; potatoes nearly raw.  I’ve made this recipe in my trusty Crock Pot for years, but tried this so I could have an all-in-one appliance.  Steaming vegetables is hit or miss.  Frozen broccoli took 3 rounds of cooking by the book’s instructions and some were still cold.  Fresh Brussels sprouts were mush cooked per the book.  The book is next to worthless.  Three different ways to cook rice are given, and the one I tried tonight, even though I added some time, turned out not fully cooked.  I made rice once before loosely based on a recipe I found on-line, and it turned out ok, but I didn’t write down how I did it.  Rice should not be that hard to cook!! I did look up how to cook eggs on-line and they turned out great.  But not any faster than boiling.  Cooking the old-fashioned way, i.e., steaming on the stovetop and cooking rice, is much faster and turns out better."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"Before the instant pot I lived on fast food and delivery. I was a sad sack of a human capable of only culinary horrors. I had given up. I had nightmares of measuring cups and smoke alarms. Any time I was in the kitchen the fire extinguisher was nearby. I had lost all hope in any kind of Martha Stewart prowess.Then this wonderful thing came into my life and I can’t describe how much my life has changed. All I do is just throw stuff in there and push a button. That’s it! No risk of fire or maiming. The neighborhood breathed a collective sigh of relief when this wonderful machine came on my doorstep. Julia Child herself rolled in her grave once I figured out how to turn it on. The instructions that came with it were a bit vague, but we live in the internet age and there was nothing a few YouTube videos couldn’t solve! I only ever cook for one so the portion is perfect for me and a perfect excuse to stay home and not ever have people over!Overnight this magical instant pot has turned me from some lowly dishwasher not allowed to touch anything hot, to some kind of Pseudo-Rachel Ray.Highly recommended for those of us who were never allowed in the kitchen as a kid. This has got to be the biggest leap in kitchen appliances since the invention of the microwave."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"I loved this item purchased in Aug of 2015, but when I accidentally dropped and broke the lid, and called for a replacement lid, I was told my only choice was to return the item. What happens to my extra two years of appliance protection I purchased (3 years worth but one had elapsed). Need I find all the little spoons and rack I didn't keep track of when I replace it to get my money refunded. I was told I couldn't return the extra lid I ordered for it, and gasket because I'd not purchased insurance for those two (small) items. Frustrated with this situation. I see these pots are still being sold, why can't they just replace my broken lid?Please say it ain't so and the clerk I spoke with on the phone made a mistake."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've been living (with gritted teeth) with our air fryer for over a year now - huge, bulky, and super hard to clean (only some pieces come apart for deep cleaner, the whole freaking basket stuck to handle and not dishwasher safe, things stick like tar). After using this air fryer lid - life changing!!!! it's a pretty big lid - but way smaller and more practical than having a separate air fryer. Super easy to use, very thoughtful design (plays music when it's correctly on top of the pot, plays music when you remove it, comes with the protector lid which also doubles as a place to put down mid use).We've done fries, fish sticks, bread rolls, even potstickers - perfectly crisp!I think people who don't love this lid never own an air fryer so they might not appreciate the functions.Now that we're used to how this lid works, we're giving away our air fryer and free up my counter space!"
4.0 out of 5 stars,"* I like the pressure cooking feature. It cuts down the traditional 45-minute adobo to 10 minutes.* I wouldn't recommend cooking pasta in it, as it fills the steam collector quickly and makes a mess.* Beans are all right, but make sure to have a lot of water to prevent burning the beans.* Saute mode is nice, the tall pot keeps the oil from splattering on the top rim.* One star less because the odor stays no matter how well you wash the pot, gasket, and lid.* As long as you don't use abrasive scrubbing pads, the stainless steel pot retains its shine!* Removable cord is convenient and is a safety feature!* The noise it makes when opening and closing is cool and is akin to those fancy Japanese rice cookers."
1.0 out of 5 stars,"I broke down and got one of these the 8 qt. people rave about them (it was on a half price sale), I am not one of those people. I cooked a whole chicken with carrots, onions and baby potatoes. I cooked the entire meal together, the chicken was thawed and slathered with a compound butter, recommended cooking time is 6 minutes to the pound. The pot took 32 minutes to come up to pressure and then the 36 minutes of time on high (a six pound chicken) time in was 1 hour and 8 minutes (68 minutes). I routinely do this done in 1 hour in my convection oven, with much better results. The meat was fall off the bone tender (OK) and moist. However the next day the meat was very dry and pasty. The carrots were mushy (hard to do to a carrot) and the baby potatoes tasted like they had been cooked from frozen, the texture was unappealing, the onions were good. Overall it was a long way to go for a not so good meal. I would have been much better off cooking it in my convection oven. Had it cooked for just the 36 minutes I would not be so put out. The extra time to come to pressure was ridiculously long,to me. Then factor in the inconvenience of the unrealistic size of the jumbo monster and how much valuable space it is going to take up when not in use to store it (which will be almost never), I an totally unimpressed."
1.0 out of 5 stars,I love the Instant Pot...but absolutely HATE the smell of the silicone ring!  I was so excited to try out the pot when I got it.  I put in all the ingredients to make tortilla soup...I set the timer and off I went to run errands.  When I got home the soup was ready and delicious.  I was so happy...I thought this pot is going to simplify my life...UNTIL I could not get the smell of the soup off of the silicone ring!  What?  I tried everything to get rid of the smell and nothing seems to work.  Other recipes I tried took on the smell...now I can't even look at the pot without getting that rank smell in my head.  I think I'm going to send the pot back!
2.0 out of 5 stars,"So far, the Instant Pot mini has sort of worked... and the 3 qt size is perfect for me.  The LED display does not go from ON to HOT on the Saute selection like it is supposed to.  Should I return it for that, I haven't decided yet.  It was hot so I sauteed the onions.But, why on earth do they suggest that you can SEE the black arrows embossed on the black lid and the black neck of the pot-----  when it would be such a simple thing to print these in WHITE so you can actually see how to set the lid onto the pot?  I took a marker and outlined the arrows, which helps, although of course, you cannot actually make a really visible mark with a marker pen on a black surface.  When the light shines just right, it is sort of makes the marker ink shine slightly."

3.0 out of 5 stars,"Recently my Cuisinart pressure cooker died, so I decided to try something different.Guess I don't need to repeat the pros since there are already plenty of those. Here are some suggestions for the manufacturer:1. the rubber (or silicone) pad under each foot is way too small, it cannot hold on a smooth granite counter top. To press a button, you have to hold the cooker using one hand, push the buttons using another hand. More importantly, the cooker may slide off the counter top easily when serving food.2. the little stem with a silicone cap in the lid: in a busy home, you don't expect to watch every small parts which may drop out and get lost. Unfortunately, the silicone cap seems to be easy to rub off from the stem when washing the lid by hand. Cuisinart cooker doesn't have such small loose parts.3. The lid top: why the metal top is not covered by plastic? I agree it looks cool with a shining metal top, but it doesn't make sense to prioritize the visual appeal above safety. It can be very hot to touch. And if the user gets burned by the metal top while holding the lid, he/she may drop the lid all together. This could break the counter top, the floor, or hurt anybody around, especially little kids.4. the silicone ring is way too hard to get out and clean. I am sure the designers of this product never do any housework.Other than those, it seems to do its job as expected, i.e. cook food."
1.0 out of 5 stars,"This delivers. On everything. You want to cook it? This baby can handle it. I put in several packages of chicken thighs that were frozen into blocks. I added a few minutes to the preset poultry setting and it cooked all of them through so quickly! I love this and if it wasn't so expensive I'd buy another in a heart beat. I'm sure you could do gourmet meals with this, but I'm more of a dump it and forget it type of gal, and this thing makes dinner a breeze!! I can't emphasize enough how amazing this thing is. GET IT! It's not possible for you to regret it!Update: This doesn't come to pressure anymore. I Googled it and I'm not doing any of the common mistakes. Everything is clean. I've done manual vs a preset time. Its not too much liquid or overly full. However now this only burns the bottom food and doesn't cook the rest at all. it will not pressure cook. At all. I'm going to try to contact the makers to get a return. Such a disappointment."
1.0 out of 5 stars,"We must have gotten defective piece, ours has been nothing but pain to use. It gives constant 'burn' error messages and cancels cooking program, taking forever in restarts to cook what should take minutes the first time. We followed all available advice from manufacturer and elsewhere, starting with clean vessel inside and out and plenty liquid, but unless boiling just water, it will throw 'burn' and cancel. The slow cooking function is also not functioning, even high setting undercooks everything that cooks fine on low in stand alone slow cooker. Garbage. Amazon does not provide support, and makes us contact manufacturer, let's see if they stand behind their product."

So my meals cost me 31 bucks each and the 'not so instant unreliable pot goes in the trash.Seriously, buy something else.1 year warranty is useless. You pay for shipping both ways to Canada and back.Amazon replaced the pot with a new one and now the inner pot is rusted all the way around-can make you very sick-since the one year warranty is up, the whole thing is going in the trash with the first one"

5.0 out of 5 stars,"Ok, so I've jumped on the instant pot bandwagon. My mom, my friend, the internet all convinced me that I need this pot. Now, I'm an instant pot lover. So what is it about this pot that makes it such an internet rage? Is it really just a glorified rice cooker? If there is a place that really knows how to make perfect rice, it would be China. Which is why I think its appropriate that this cooker is make there.But its more than just a rice cooker. This pot has 7 different functions, and a plethora of recipes that can be concocted in those 7 functions. Its like an experimental cook’s dream machine. If you are familiar with a pressure cooker, this is exactly that, it has the pressure release valve that will scare the (*#!&) out of you every single time you switch it over. But don’t let that intimidate you out of this purchase. This is better than a crock pot, in that you can cook some of the same meals, like beans or pot roast in a fraction of the time.No, its not instant, so, don’t get mad that your dry beans didn’t cook in 30 minutes, because that’s not realistic, but they will get done much faster than stovetop or crockpot. Now, lets talk about space. I have an RV, and this is perfect for making so many meals in this small kitchen space. Maybe you have a great big kitchen in a house and this is just another gadget that you can’t justify adding. I can understand that. But, if you already use the crockpot, rice cooker, and make lots of beans, maybe this would be a good upgrade to your kitchen appliances.So, here I am, joining your mom, friend, and the internet into trying to talk you into buying your own instant pot. I hope my review helped you make that decision. I have no personal gain in whether you purchase this product or not, and I didn’t receive my instant pot for free (unfortunately). Happy experimenting!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have finally jumped on the Instant Pot train! After hearing friends rave about their Instant Pots and after the crock in my crock pot cracked, I decided to invest some of my Christmas money in one of my own. It took me days to decide which model to purchase. I looked at every store in town and they were sold out everywhere with the exception of the small 3 qt size which I had decided was too small. Forced to wait on my 2 day prime delivery, I ordered from Amazon. Finally it arrived Monday prior to lunch. I rushed out and bought a chuck roast to christen it with. I scoured the instant pot recipes I had found on Facebook and found one to try. What would take hours in the oven or crock pot took about 1 hour total in the instant pot. Next day I boiled eggs in it. Push a button, walk away, no worries about water coming to a boil or how long you leave the eggs in the pot. They peel better than any egg I've ever boiled. Next I cooked a turkey breast. It was still partially frozen and was done in an hour and a half start to finish. I've made bone broth in it as well. Again you just push a button and let it do it's thing. No need to stick around and watch a pot boil. It's fabulous and I can see this becoming one of my favorite kitchen items of all time. Is it for everything? No, but then again no kitchen tool I've ever bought is for everything. But it's for a lot of things and that's what I love about it!"

There is an error stating that the pressure censor has malfunctioned and to ""contact the manufacturer"". We have done that and have gotten NO response. Not even an acknowledgement much less a solution. So save your money and get an off-brand pressure cooker, it will work just as well and you'll get better response from the manufacturer."

1.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought an Instant Pot that was delivered on Jan. 13. I raved about it. I told all my friends. I made: hummus, roasted chicken, couscous, risotto and spaghetti and meatballs. That is all. This morning (Sunday - Feb. 3), I turned it on to Saute and put in ingredients for Instant Pot Taco Soup. When I went to cancel Saute and turn it to Pressure Cook, I realized I no longer had a display. Hmmm... I unplugged it - both at the wall and at the pot. No success in getting it to come back on. I jiggled the plug. I made sure there was power to the outlet. Nothing. I looked on the Troubleshoot page of the manual and it said that either I had no power to the unit or the fuse had blown. I've used it FIVE times. I've tried to call support numerous times this morning - it rings one time and then I immediately get a busy signal. I go to their website to fill out a support ticket and they tell me they need:Photo of the inside of the cooker base without the inner potPhoto of the silver sticker located at the back of the unitA copy of your purchase receiptA picture of the silver sticker on the back of the cooker baseSerial number from bottom of potCurrent shipping address and phone numberThe serial number should tell them all they need to know about my IP. I've gone back and read the reviews - it seems that it's not terribly unusual for a pot to stop working and that their customer service sucks. It is Sunday morning, I'm trying to make a pot of soup to watch the Super Bowl and I have an IP inner pot full of soup that needs to cook. I cannot even believe this. I've used it five d*%n times. I've already blown a fuse? Seriously?!? I will update this once I get some sort of solution, but I won't ever give this thing 5 stars. (By the way, I bought an extended warranty but, apparently, it doesn't start working until the IP warranty expires. And, apparently, good luck to me getting any sort of solution from the good folks at Instant Pot!) I seriously need to apologize to everyone I told to buy an Instant Pot..."
1.0 out of 5 stars,"I have had my instant pot for two years and I LOVED it. I use it multiple times per week. However on Saturday while trying to make dinner the pot failed and I kept getting a c6H error on it. This one requires contacting customer service. I did so, and after some back and forth, they basically blamed the error on me and then offered to sell me a new one with a loyalty discount of 30% that makes it cost the same price as it currently is on Amazon!  I have taken good care of my Instant Pot, and was a loyal customer and convinced many friends and family to buy the device. However, if it is going to have fatal errors in only two years and I will be required to pay to replace it, it is a waste of my money. This shouldn't be a disposable device that has to be replaced every couple of years, and if normal use following the directions is enough to cause it to stop working after that time, it's a poor deal. I had another non-Instant Pot electric pressure cooker that worked just as well, cost less, and could stand up to heavier use than this one has turned been able to. I'm disappointed in their customer service, and will be looking for a replacement from a different company. Instant Pot has lost me as a customer, and I had been considering buying multiple other devices from them."

It reminds me of a small Presto electric pressure pot I had 35 years ago and I cried when it quit working and I couldn't replace it.  It took a long time for someone to come up with a replacement, but I'm sure glad they did.  I've used it at least twice a week since I got it.Update:  I tried my first effort using it as a slow cooker.  It's been 4.5 hours and I can't get the temperature to rise above 164 degrees.  Definitely not hot enough to cook meat.  I had intended to get rid of my slow cooker, but I can see that I still will have to use it.  They shouldn't advertise it as a slow cooker if it doesn't perform as such.  I'm still entirely happy with it as a pressure cooker."

I went back and read reviews and turns out this has affected many other people. Not a fan of the brand because of customer service. If there is a faulty part, at least stand by your product and make it right."
3.0 out of 5 stars,"We jumped on the Instant Pot bandwagon and have given it a try preparing several meals with it. While it’s a perfectly decent product, we found that there are limitations to what a pressure cooker can do well.  In fact, so far I would say that we’ve found that while it is capable of cooking some dishes quickly, we haven’t found any that it’s done more than a fair job with. Typically, we found that texture and flavor were better when dishes were prepared in a more traditional manner.  We’ve also used the Instant Pot as a slow cooker using the optional glass lid. Again, it did a decent job but I wouldn’t say it matches the performance of a true slow cooker.UPDATE: After six months with our Instant Pot, we gave it up and passed it on to a family member. We just didn’t find the utility in it."

3.0 out of 5 stars,"So, I loved using my previously purchased Instant Pot, but it died after 2 years.  The company told me it sounded like a blown fuse.  Unfortunately, they use a proprietary screw to access the fuse and I would not be able to change it myself.  Therefore, they recommended I purchase a new Instant Pot.  To make the new purchase less painful, the company’s representative said she would send me an invoice to my email address with a small price reduction.  Yet, I never received the invoice.  She told me to check my junk folder (but it wasn’t there).  The funny thing is that the customer service rep could send me emails each day and I would receive them.  But, whenever she would send me an email with the reduced-price invoice, it would, mysteriously, not make it to me.  I suspect she was just testing my patience (and she won).  I ended up paying full price for a new Instant Pot.In short, the product is awesome, but the company appears to have a greed component.  The Instant Pot is definitely well-made and should stand up to many years of use—if not for the fuse that’s designed to fail right after the warranty expires.  If you can’t tolerate this type of behavior from a company, then don’t buy this product.  Otherwise, be prepared to buy a new Instant Pot every couple of years (like me)."
1.0 out of 5 stars,"DONT' EVEN BOTHER... I think the concept could have been good; however if has failed to deliver a meal. Just poor performance. I have been using pressure cookers for decades, I am following not only the specifications, but the directions in the booklets and cooking tables from their website. Even a simple beef-stew does not get done right.The juices get fully evaporated because the moisture/juices escape through the valve even when in the sealed position and in full pressure, so the meat comes out tough and dry. Last week I reached out through their website with questions and concerns, and was asked to fill out a ticket, which I did, I have never heard back. NOT A GOOD PRODUCT.Irene"
1.0 out of 5 stars,"The new 'safety feature' which notifies user when food is burning is so finicky that it makes the appliance unusable.  If even the smallest spec of food remains stuck to the pot after saute, or a thicker sauce is used, proper cooking becomes impossible.  It is no convenience to have to remove the food from the pot after sauteing to clean the pot...or to have to saute in a separate pan for this to MAYBE work properly.And yes... tried and true recipes were followed to the letter...some with even more water added than suggested but to no avail.  Everything....and I mean EVERYTHING thicker than water burned.The pot simply gets too hot, is not thick enough for the heat used to properly cook the food without burning.  Can only conclude this is a defective and deficient design that the company will not acknowledge.  They will tell you to do all sorts of things, or to buy add-ons to prevent this until such time as it is no longer returnable.  Read the comments on their web site....at least they don't seem to edit out negative comments to their credit.Pot returned to Amazon as defective."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This fits on my Darth Vader Duo perfectly. Instructions were easy to follow and the heat pad makes it easy by giving me a place to put the hot lid. The first day we got it, we airfried up some homemade Vietnamese spring rolls (egg rolls) and they came out so crispy like they were fried in oil! All we did was spray the two layers of spring rolls with Pam and air fried them at 400° for 15ish mind. I gave the bottom layer another 4 mins without the broiler plate and they came out the same crispiness as the top layer on the broiler plate. The basket with the broiler plate (2 layers) held 10 spring rolls (4”x1” size). I suspect the basket could fit 10-15 wings too.I was on the fence about getting it, but now that I did, I do not regret it one bit! The lid works great and I don’t have to have a separate appliance sitting on the shelf to air fry.  Totally recommend for anyone that has a 6qt IP!"
1.0 out of 5 stars,"Unless you are only air frying for one person this is useless.  The basket which you put one layer of food into is only 7 inches in diameter.  You can only put a small number of veges, fries, or chicken wings in there.  If you pile them on top of one another they will not fry up evenly (to say the least).  Also, you need to turn them over half way through.  Which means lifting this bulky lid (it's enormous for a cooking implement) place it on a special pad and then reach into this hot pot or pull out the hot inner basket and turn everything to the other side.  Compared to a real air fryer this is a joke and a total pain to use."

We considered just buying another 6qt to add to the mix, but after some research we came across this Wolly Mammoth size 10qt and took a chance. A success! Today he loaded 10lbs of chicken breast, a variety of spices and 2 large bags of frozen corn at 80minutes cook time with 19 minutes of depressurization and Viola! Spicy, Juicy falling apart chicken breast to dress up anyway you want! And enough leftovers for a couple of days! (Family of four with teen and pre-teen) I highly recommend it!!!!!"
1.0 out of 5 stars,Used for Chicken (overcooked it)It does not brown (I thought it was advertised for that)Three other models Released at Costco  were 30% Less (Approx) and did more.I think we are done!The cook book arrived 2 weeks later.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Boy do I love my IP. I made the Savory blue cheese cake among other things using the 7” springform pan. Have cooked chili, chicken stock, soup, quinoa, potatoes etc. It’s great for just sauté and “regular cooking” not just pressure cooking. I have the IP Miracle cookbook too. Lots of internet sites offering tips & recipes. It was a smart purchase for me & my small kitchen. It’s like having an extra burner I can plug in somewhere else, leaving more room in the kitchen. It put fun and “adventure” back in my cooking. You won’t be disappointed if you buy one. Someone with really limited kitchen (or no kitchen) could do just about anything with this appliance. Really! It is so versatile & efficient! And Safe!"
4.0 out of 5 stars,"Got this because I heard it's very versatile and replace a lot of kitchen appliances, saving up space.After trying it out, this seem not to be entirely the case.For example, it does not cook rice wellMy family consume rice several times a week, and thought this would be a good rice cooker replacement. Sadly it wasn't. After experimenting and researching different methods; i couldn't get the right texture. Either it's too wet, too dry, or not consistent throughout.My main rice cooker is still my Zojirushi 604976 for reference/comparisonAfter using it for several months now, found it only good for making wet, moist products like soups, stews, curry and chili (wet/soup style).Basically makes for a good crock pot. Downside is there's no glass lid, but cooks contents in a shorter amount of time.What the insta-pot is really good at is being a rice porridge maker. Makes rice porridge way better than my Zojirushi rice cooker. This is the main use I have for the insta pot at the moment, aside from some soup recipes.For actual use, it's very easy. You get used very quickly to it like trying to program a new microwave.Note when done cooking you have to release pressured air, before you can open the lid.Opted for the 3 quart over the 6 or 8 quart since those were too bulky and takes up too much space in the kitchen. 3 quart is perfect for a 1-4 person household.Overall, will not replace several appliances in your kitchen, but has it's uses."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"The three-quart pot works as easily as described.  Add about ten minutes time to what the recipes say for the pot to get up to pressure.Only real complaint is that the company referred me to a recipe web site when I asked about adjusting recipes for the smaller pot.(I know: adjusting quantity for a smaller batch is trivial, but is there a cook-time adjustment, or an adjustment for liquid quantities, as a higher percentage of the liquid will be lost during cooking in a smaller pot.)  The recommended website had ZERO information for adjusting for the smaller electric pressure cooker, and did not respond to my blog questions."
1.0 out of 5 stars,I have a regular air fryer and an instant pot. I was hoping this could eliminate one of them from my counter because I use them both regularly. This lid is very heavy and bulky. It took longer to cook than my air fryer. Sadly I returned it.
1.0 out of 5 stars,"Broke after 2nd use. The electrical plug entrance on the pot is faulty in design and manufacturing. This can lead to the pot not working and/or blowing the internal fuse. Either way you will be stuck woth this  experience. I got in contact with their customer support 3 times by phone taking 30 minutes or more for the phone  call. I have also three emails into them with a response saying to attach pictures of the serial, inside the pot, label on the back and a receipt. I have attach the photos and get a reply to the email that I sent them with the same automated blurb as before requesting the same pictures that are in the reply. I researched further and found numerous complaints with the BBB and other similar reviews with the appliance not lasting a year. If you plan on using it twice get it. If you want a dependable customer service and appliance buy the competitions."
1.0 out of 5 stars,"We have only owned our Duo Plus for a month and after the fifth time using it, we received a fatal C6L error code.  Too late to return to Amazon.  Major inconvenience for our family to deal with returning it to Instant Pot. I found many users dealing with faulty pressure cooker sensors soon after purchasing the appliance."
1.0 out of 5 stars,"With much anticipation and excitement, I opened my 'new' instapot, and it was very visibly and obviously used! I am appalled and disgusted! There were greasy fingerprints all over the outside of the pot. Inside, smelled like old food, there was old crust and such on the outer rim! Not just that, but the measuring cup and recipe book was missing. I am very disgusted and disappointed."
2.0 out of 5 stars,"Maybe I just dont have the patience to figure this thing out, but it seems to me that it's just not worth it. It's pretty big and takes up a lot of counter space for starters. Which isn't really a deal breaker since crockpots also take up a lot of space, but I figured it's worth mentioning. I got this because I clearly misunderstood the advertised cooking times. I thought a recipe that claimed to take 35 minutes really only took 35 minutes! (plus 10 minutes of prep time of course). Unfortunately, it takes 10-15 minutes for it to come up to pressure, 35 minutes to cook, and potentially up to 20 minutes to release pressure. In the end, it's just doesnt do what I needed it to do and I am returning it. If you are buying the Instat Pot for the purpose of giving you more a more hands off cooking experience; maybe to free up your hands/time so you can do something else, then I could see how this would work out for you. But if you are considering buying to make cooking ""easier"" and all around ""faster"", it's not really worth it IMO."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"Works great, have 6qt ultra, and am very happy with this purchase. My only gripe is its not very apparent how to get the multi level tray in and out during cooking (when using both levels), to flip food on the bottom. Would also have liked some recipes of some sort."
1.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased two of them. Both worked well for the first couple months. However, they both started working improperly in recently months (after about 20 months of very gentle home use, like once a day). Both of them would not steam properly, they were unable to increase the pressure and the clock starts to run  before pressure is reached, which makes the food not fully cooked. Furthermore, both of them started to have temperature control problem, that they both would over cooked a thick layer of rice on the bottom of the pot. Such issues never happened in the past.Based on the above experience, I would rate the pot as poor since I am not expecting a $140 pot to last for less than 2 years."
2.0 out of 5 stars,"I feel like the reviews are overrated. It’s a nice unit that does a lot of cooking chores. I’m very happy that it’s stainless, not aluminum inside the cooking pot. However, I don’t think I will be using it very often. Chicken does steam easily and quickly so it’s good for shredded chicken. But having to pre-brown things before cooking is a nuisance. Also the cook times are crazy—nothing in any of the books match..each one tells you something different. At one point it says to never turn it on without 32oz of liquid in the pot. The directions seem to be written by people who don’t all speak the same language because measurements aren’t consistent and they use recipes referring to buttons this doesn’t have(good luck looking for that program button to pressure cook!) Even accounting for lousy instructions, the finished products are never what I’d hoped for. Brown rice turned out a bit al denté than I like...and you can’t make any adjustments while it’s cooking..it just comes out however and you can deal or start over. I think if you do a lot of ‘pot’ style meals, like soup, this would be lovely. But it doesn’t replace my AirFryer that can do literally anything—only downside is that’s all aluminum and the coating comes off really easily..so the Instant Pot wins for having the stainless steel pot...but there’s nothing I want to cook in it. Overall not for me, and I’ll prob re-gift this to someone.Update 5/7/20: I’ve discovered this will cook rice quickly and effectively. Brown rice is 12 minutes, jasmine is 4. Cooking chicken for shredding is easy and quick. However, there’s nothing else u can cook in it. Literally everything burns regardless of how much liquid u use. I hate this thing and only am keeping it bc I eat a lot of rice and this makes rice in no time...but it simply is the worst at anything else. Even chili!! How do u possibly burn chili??? This can and does. I need to get my slow cooker out of storage bc this thing even burns if u use the slow cook function. Basically it’s an overpriced rice maker. Never again, Instant Pot!"
4.0 out of 5 stars,"This is as cool as everyone says it is. But I'm deducting a star for two reasons, and I hope the manufacturer will take note. The major reason is that the metal edges around the inside of the lid, especially where they stick out (see photo), were not properly buffed out and had some very sharp edges. I got two small cuts on my fingers from them. Nothing serious, but this should NEVER happen in a product like this. It's a problem on the line. Second, the silicon gasket that seals the lid has a very strong, chemical smell out of the box. We have many silicon appliances, and I've never noticed anything like that. Washing in hot water and the ""trial run"" they suggest took care of it. But it makes a very bad first impression when you think that something with such a nasty smell is going to be intimately connected to a hot, high pressure cooking process. I emphasize that we are very happy with the purchase and with what we have prepared so far. This would be a 5-star review if not for the points I have raised."
2.0 out of 5 stars,"If you're considering an Instant Pot ... well, let me tell ya that, as a first time user of said Instant Pot, and as with everything else, you should take all advertisement with a grain of salt! The recipe I made last night was advertised as a 20 minute ""ridiculously easy"" bean soup recipe.What happened in real life is this:1) shop for all the ingredients which cost about ... ummm, maybe about $50 - 1 hour2) chop all the ingredients - 1 hour give or take3) figure out the Instant Pot - well, that's complicated, but let's just say about 30 minutes of watching videos on line and scratching head4) turn on the Instant Pot and set it to 5 minutes. Consternation ensued when 7 minutes later the Instant Pot still showed as being ""on"". More online searching revealed it takes 10-15 minutes for the Instant Pot to actually begin to cook. Aha, noted. Then the 5 minute timer kicked in. Oooohhkkk. I'm thinking we're done now. Well ... WRONG!!! It's now time to release the pressure, which has to be done naturally, which according to the book takes between 10 - 40 minutes. After about 15 minutes, we decided, we'll do a quick release of pressure, which took another 5 minutes.So, about 2.5 hours worth of chopping and cooking and figuring out the Instant Pot led to a wonderful, if somewhat expensive, home cooked bean soup.The jury is still out on this one, and frankly I don't know how to rate it."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have only used my Instant pot 3 x's in the past 2 years, but this attachment is a game-changer for me. Yesterday and today I made zucchini fritters, salmon, chicken and tempeh and they all came out perfect.  I really don't like to cook or clean up so this makes things a lot easier for me. Making fish in there a dozen times will make up for the cost of buying the lid for me.  No splatter, no sticking, no smoke, no strong odors, minimal cleanup. I love how I just set the timer and I don't even have to check up on what's cooking.  I've actually canceled my Blue Apron subscription with plans to look over more recipes.  Looking forward to dehydrating something."
1.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased this after hearing so many people rave about them and was excited about using this.  I have used a pressure cooker and canner for years, but this seemed to promise easier meals and it was a huge draw to me that the pot was stainless steel and not aluminum like my other pressure cookers.  Other than the stainless steel factor, though, it's just a glorified pressure cooker, which I can understand would be a draw to people who have not used pressure cookers before.  I didn't use it very much because it was a clunky appliance and I don't have counter space for it, so it had to be put away each time, and honestly it didn't do anything that a good ol' basic pressure cooker does except turn off after a certain amount of time and get to the correct pressure on its own.However, I would not have left a review at all except a few weeks ago I went to use it and plugged it in, and... nothing.  No power at all.  No lights, nothing.  It had rarely been used, always cleaned up right after use and put away dry, always cared for well.  I had it filled up with ingredients to make chicken stock and it wouldn't even turn on.  I tried everything - different outlets, looking for a reset button, removing everything and putting it back together again..  nothing.  I was sure it was something simple so I got online and looked up problem solving, tried everything I could find... nothing.  I moved everything to a regular pot on the stove and simmered it the regular way, and contacted instant pot customer service.  I told them it was past the warranty but that I had only used it a handful of times, and they sent me an email with a list of detailed photos to take and send them.  The rim, the inside, the outside, several stickers, a picture of it plugged in, the control panel, the pot with a ruler laying across it to show that it is still level, photos to assure that there was no damage caused by me, etc.  So I took all these photos and sent them over, which took a good bit of time but since they knew it was past the warranty and still asked for the photos, I figured they were standing behind their product since it was obviously defective.  I got a reply email saying they hadn't received all the photos.  I resent them.  I got a reply saying that  it looks like the cooker base is dead and their suggestion was that I purchase a new one.  ???  First, why did I go through all the trouble of demonstrating that it was truly dead if they weren't going to do anything about it?  And second, why in the world would I purchase a whole new instant pot when it completely stopped working after only a few times, and has such poor customer service?  Are there people who are really so gullible that they will just repurchasing poor quality products, and expensive ones at that?  I am extremely frustrated with the company and with myself for falling for this overpriced gadget.  My recommendation - get a good ol' fashioned pressure cooker with no bells and whistles, no electronic dashboard or computer chip, no beeping noises of flashing lights.  It will last you a lifetime.  And if you do feel you need a computerized pressure cooker, go with a brand who will stand behind their products and provide great customer support."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"My husband cooks with this all the time to make things like risotto, soups, and roasts. He likes that the programming is intuitive compared to our old one. We also like the safety features. For example, we made chili and put the beans on the bottom when we should’ve put the thin liquids on the bottom and layer thick on top. This caused burning to occur. The Instapot recognized this when the burning started, however, sounded a warning, turned off, and put “burn” on the digital display. We were then able to open it and corrected the issue before it continued."
5.0 out of 5 stars,In love with my Air frier lid!! This thing is awesome! The basket is super easy to clean! And it’s super easy to use! I did want to mention it does not lock on your instant pot like you’re regular pressure cooker lid. It just sits on top of your pot. I had a mini heart attack at first and thought my pot wasn’t compatible haha.
1.0 out of 5 stars,"I recently purchased this item to replace a previous instapot that worked for two years but stopped pressurizing. I was excited when it went on sale on prime day so I immediately bought it. When the new one arrived, it had the same problem as the broken one and wouldn’t pressurize. I followed the recipes exactly as written. I called instapot to see if there was anything that could be done. After being on hold for over an hour I was given a ticket number because there was nothing they could do and told someone would contact me in 2 business days. After 7 business days and no contact I sent the item back to amazon after reading the reviews that instapot customer service was terrible. Instead of a refund I asked for a replacement. Big mistake. I had the same problem with the new one, No pressurizing. I never had this problem with my original one. I am finished with instapot and sending it back to Amazon. Only positive about this experience is Amazon’s amazing customer service."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm new to pressure cooking, and it makes me a little nervous! But I read a lot of good things about the instant pot so I decided to take the plunge and buy one.I originally bought the 6 qt size and it was too heavy for me to lift in and out of a cabinet frequently. It might have been ok if it was going to stay on a counter and always be out. This smaller size is easier to move around, and since I'm not feeding a family, it's fine for me. I might get the bigger one if I had the counter space so I could make larger batches of food at once, but for now this one's fine.So far it's worked well.It doesn't always save time.For starters, there's a sear function. I guess some people like the idea of searing and then cooking in the same pot. I think it's faster and easier to sear something in a pan on the stove and then put it in.As a matter of fact, anything that can cook in an hour or less on the stove, will probably be easier and faster on the stove. Because keep in mind, the instant pot takes about 15 to 20 minutes to heat up, then there's the actual cooking time (usually 15 minutes to an hour for most recipes), then depending on what you're cooking, you can do a quick release of pressure, or let the instant pot cool down on its own.When I tried to do a quick release (as one recipe told me to do!) it didn't just release steam, but a geyser of liquid and grease all over my kitchen! So now I let it cool down on its own - which takes another 20 to 30 minutes. So anything I make in the instant pot will take me at least an hour start to finish. Maybe more. And it's more pieces to clean up than one pot on the stove. However, something cooking in an instant pot doesn't have to be watched as carefully for that hour its in use. I can walk away and do other things that I might not be able to do while cooking on a stove for an hour.But in general, for something that would normally take more than an hour on the stove or oven, this can work well. For me, if I can cook it on the stove or oven, start to finish, in an hour or so, I'll usually chose the stove or oven. The instant pot cook time might be 15 minutes, but with the warm up and cool down, it can take an hour there too.Safety issues I have are with the steam release valve. The open and closed position are not clearly marked. They're marked, but in small raised black lettering on a black background that's hard to see. So what's the logical thing to do? Lean in to read it! But you do NOT want to lean in or have any part of your body near the steam valve! I wish that was marked in a way that was easier to see.Another issue with the steam release valve is the same as it would be for any pressure cooker. If you're not used to pressure cooking, it's easy to grab it from the top which will result in major burns if you open it that way! This isn't a problem that's limited to instant pots, but it's a safety feature I wish someone would address with pressure cookers in general. Maybe invent a steam release valve that is not easy to grip from the top, or impossible to grip from the top. Something that can only be opened using a side lever.I worry about older people or distracted people using these or any pressure cookers. If you have children around, make sure they can't get near this. - Much like any item that gets hot during cooking and can burn. There are safety features to keep the pot from being opened if the steam has not been released (quickly or naturally after it cools down on its own) but the quick release steam valve can be really dangerous if it's moved to the open position by a child, a distracted person, or a curious pet who might lean in for a sniff!Another thing to know is that the silicone seal will absorb food odors - as all silicone does. I don't really mind much. I've read that some people buy extra silicone rings and use one for savory cooking and one for sweet so the odor doesn't affect their cooking flavors. I'm not sure that's needed, but extra silicone rings are inexpensive on amazon. (about $5 I think?)Other than the things mentioned above, I'm happy with the instant pot! It works well, cooks well, you can set the pressure and time manually or use a pre-set setting, and it even has a slow cooker setting if I decide to go back to slow cooking instead of pressure cooking.I don't use mine regularly like people who are nuts about these. I use mine once in a while. Maybe about 10 times so far. Overall, it works very well and I'm happy I bought it. I'm especially happy with this size. It's more manageable to lift and move around if you'll be keeping it in a cabinet and not out all the time."
3.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought this a few weeks ago, and was thoroughly intimidated by the apparent complexity and lack of information.  As one reviewer said, the manual doesn't tell you how high the cooking temperatures are or the length of various cycles.  And speaking of the manual, the manual Amazon sent shows items that don't match the pot.  The manual says to line up the arrow on the lid with the arrow on the pot and then turn counter-clockwise.  No arrows.  Had to turn clockwise to close.  My manual says in one place that selecting the function key (the food item you are cooking) will automatically set the pressure.  It doesn't.  If you want high pressure you have to also press the pressure button to raise it from low to high. It says that in a different place.The other problem I have had is in finding recipes for items I want to cook.  I make milk braised pork shoulder ala Marcella Hazen but could only find a recipe for milk braised pork loin; I had to guess at cooking times.  The recipe book that comes with it is written for Chinese people and sometimes doesn't make sense.  I bought a recipe book, but it is full of recipes that I would never want to make.  Why would you bake a pie or a cake in this thing when a regular oven works just fine?  You can't possibly save any time.  I expect that it will be great for cooking lots of things, but the learning curve is steep.  There are blogs available that are helpful.One thing that I give it low marks for is that it is much larger than it appears in pictures.  I thought I would be able to leave it out on the counter, but it takes up far too much room.  Luckily, I was able to rearrange one cupboard so I can put it away."
4.0 out of 5 stars,The only issue I've had is that the rubber seal tends to absorb smells and it's been pretty hard if not impossible to get the smells out.
1.0 out of 5 stars,"Everything was great until I need some customer service. My girlfriend accidentally poured a bowl of beans into the pot base without inner.  there's no way to get them out unless open the bottom of the pot. We did our research and called the customer service but there's no indication about what size the little screw is!!!!! Absolutely unbelievable!!! In the end, the man in the customer service told me it's a ""1/8 size flat head bit"", I trusted him, bought the set with ""1/8 size flat head bit"" at Home Depot, but it didn't work!!!! Can you believe it?  Absolutely terrible experience!!! I decided to trust myself and I finally find the correct one. In the picture the top screw is the correct size, it's something with a curve, and a T10 or T15(I can't understand what it means sorry). Hope this comment is useful for people with the same issue and also hope Instantpot can increase your customer service level!!!!"
1.0 out of 5 stars,"We were very excited to finally get a pressure cooker, but that excitement was short-lived. After only 3 uses, the instant pot is now a paperweight. We've contacted Instant Pot to see what we can do, and they're having us jump through a bunch of hoops before they'll do anything. (UPDATE: I've sent them 6 photos of the instant pot now. Still waiting for confirmation that they'll replace it)If it IS the fuse, it doesn't look like a very straight forward process to fix it. It's not just ""unplug the dead fuse, plug in the new fuse"". We would have to open the bottom panel, remove a board, pull out the cable with the fuse running in-line, cut out the old fuse, slip on heat-shrink, solder in the new fuse, heat the heat-shrink to protect it, then reassemble everything.If I fix it, I'll sell it and buy something else. Terrible product made by a terrible company."
1.0 out of 5 stars,"We bought the book with 100 recipes for the mini pot.  After just scanning through it and viewing the prep times, it was obvious that this is not a time saver.  We made beef stroganoff, which normally would take about 25 minutes, but with the ""Instant Pot"", it took 10 minutes to gather steam and then 25 minutes to cook and then about 20 minutes to clean up.There is no handle for the inner pot, so on our first try, we miscalculated our grip and spilled the stroganoff all over the floor.  It needs a handle.The design is such that it is easy for food to get into all of the nooks and crannies built into the pot.  Impossible to really clean.The book is not kidding about having several of the plastic seals, because they absorb smells that can never go away.The advertisement says the cooker does not steam up the room or release odors.  We had steam all over the kitchen, and the odors have to go somewhere.  They did.  Into the kitchen as well.  That was even before we opened the lid to take out the food.  If used with any food that has grease in it, like hamburger, the kitchen will soon be covered with grease from the mist that spews into the room.My feeling is that this ""gadget"" appeals to people who think that the cute buttons actually mean that they can just push a button and have the meal printed on the top of the button.  It's great for people who have no idea how to cook in the first place, and it gives the perception that little cooking knowledge is needed.As usual with Chinese manufactured products, they don't make any effort to make a manual that ordinary American-English speaking people can understand.  Right off the bat, we did the First Time Use section.  It explained a little about how to start it and build a head of steam for pressure cooking and then dropped us off a cliff by not explaining what to do after it is pressurized.  It needs at least one more paragraph to finish that section.Remember to add at least 50-100% more time to clean the pot after you are done cooking.  And, if you drop the pot, add a couple of hours to remove the grease all over the floor.This is an example of whiz-bang technology that has a lot of promise, but is much less useful than the user would think.  It does NOT save time in cooking.  Just go to the internet, find a recipe and cook it in your pot or pan.  Save yourself money and oodles of time."

Just FYI that's the way to go!!***Purchased this over priced pressure cooker then had it shipped to my husband in kuwait & it never worked.

Submitted the problem over a week ago with photographs and everything and they have not responded.

Which happens quite a lot in my house. Until I got this amazing invention!I've had it for about 2 weeks now and all I can say is Oh. MY. GOD! Why am I just now finding out about this?When I did cook, one of the best meals I used to make was chicken tikka, it would take me 3 hours or more and I'd have 300 dishes to do after. So I stopped making it. It pretty much was your basic food for a while. And it was the same things over and over and over agin. Blah.Then my friend kept telling me about this and I was like, I don't need another dang appliance in my house that I won't use. She brought it over and showed me how to use it and cooked something that would normally take me two hours to cook, cooked in less the 45 mins. All I had to do was sauté, throw some stuff in there and turn it on.So I bought one and now my chicken tikka is done in half the time!! And I only have one pot to clean!!!! I can't say anything negative about this bad boy. I'll never cook on my stove again!!!!"
1.0 out of 5 stars,"This seemed like a great product - it was my first pressure cooker purchase. It was great for a short while - lots of options for making one-pot meals, including baby food.  But it stopped working suddenly not even 6 months after I bought it.  I had been frustrated by its not infrequent inability to seal properly which then ruins whatever you are cooking.  The company, despite a one year warranty would not replace.  They said liquid had gotten into the core, which is almost impossible not to do, based on the design (if you make pasta it almost always spills over).In any case, I went and bought a Fagor instead and it’s a much superior product."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"so far, so good. anything ""not so great"" about the IP is down to me & my being a newbie at this! i've turned to pinterest for help… i boiled water first, then made a dozen hardboiled eggs… then tackled steak chili.the only issues i'm having so far are ""venting"" related. because of where i have to place the IP, the vented steam is shooting straight into my cubpoards and items on the kitchen wall. i just ordered a little steam release ""vent"" gizmo thingy that redirects the the steam so it's not shooting UP.the only other issue i've had is the BURN notice, but pinterest to the rescue again! google helps, too. basically, there's a LOT of help out there if you look--don't let any ""bumps in the road"" deter you from using this amazing device! i did purchase a *nonstick* inner pot to help eleviate the BURN issue, and, following online advice, i just make sure there's enough liquid and try to layer the ingredients instead of mixing them up. also, cooling off the inner pot *after* i sautee and *before* i actually pressure cook the ""meal.""i have a teeny tiny kitchen, and i donated my rice cooker & relocated my slow cooker to the basement--this is all i need & use!"
1.0 out of 5 stars,"Worked great... when it worked.  After telling so many people how much I loved it, our InstantPot was dead after less than 2 months.  Middle of a cycle just powered off and wouldn't turn back on.  Tried to contact support, no answer.  Finally called and was told they had a two week wait to answer a support request.  After much hemming and hawing they finally put my ticket into a queue just for dead pots, but it'll be another couple weeks minimum before I get a replacement."
1.0 out of 5 stars,"If I could rate ZERO and I would, but the option of the rating is only from 1-5. After I contacted the Instant Pot manufacture regarding dysfunction of instant pot pressure valve, I decided to write the review to share with others. I bought Instant Pot DUO Plus 3 Qtr. 9-in-1 last Thanksgiving for my parents gift, Unfortunately, just little over 6 months, the instant pot no long pressurizing because the pressure float valve could not pop up creating pressures needed while it is on sealing mode. I cleaned and checked the sealing ring as well as float valve; the float valve still does not pop for the pressure. Finally I contacted amazon customer service, they immediately told me there in nothing to do with them that I need to contact manufacture myself if it is under the warranty. When I contacted the manufacture, the service representative requested me to answer the questionnaires then do the heating test for him, and send the results back via email. I spent my time did all that in my very busy schedules. Guess what, He replied email said that everything is fine. We cannot do anything for you at this point, but if you want to purchase another one, we can compensate you with $10 coupon. I think this is completely insult, and mostly the quality of the instant pot sucks. NO product should only last for 6 months and manufacture refuse to replace it under the product warranty. That alone is very disturbing and makes me angry."

2.0 out of 5 stars,"UPDATE: after nearly 2 years of use the fuse blew and I had to get a replacement cord (the fuse is built into the cord). The replacement cord doesn’t have a ground (sold here on Amazon and listed as UL - it is not!) I wrote to Instant Pot and they said I’m using the pot at my own risk now, but offered me $10 off my next pot. This is more unreliable, disposable garbage. (See the response from Instant Pot at the bottom of my post).The newly re-designed Instant Pot (“design 2”) is not nearly as a good as the old version (“design1”). We bought a 6 quart pot in July 2016 and LOVED it. We used it so much we decided to give it to good friends and order the 8 quart. But while the old model was reliable and easy to use, the new model that arrived in December 2016 had a redesigned valve and seal. This new unit had a floppier seal. It doesn't seal 75% of the time unless I watch it and either push it down to seal during the pressuring period, or open and forcefully press down the lid. The old one was set and forget. The new one sometimes never seals, or it has lost most of it's moisture through steam before it does seal, leading to dried or burned food. It's awful. I wrote to the company to ask for a replacement rubber ring (it's much floppier than the old design) and they were snide and accusatory in their response. They gave me a long list of things to check before writing back to them. No thanks for the hassle. I found replacement silicone rings for $10 and hope it might solve the issue. What a disappointment.“Thank you for the response. It is appreciated.As we cannot confirm how any alteration affected the integrity of your Instant Pot, we recommend a replacement. If you do continue to use the altered Instant Pot, please be advised that it is at your own risk.As there are no certified Instant Pot repair technicians nor repair process, we cannot facilitate nor condone any repair of an Instant Pot.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"What else can you say about an Instant Pot except ""perfection."" I already had a 6 quart Instant Pot which I love and another brand 3 quart pressure cooker. Although I used the 3 quart a lot, it had a non-stick inner pot. I decided to buy this 3 quart Instant Pot because of the stainless steel pot which I prefer. I am only cooking for myself, but I like to make large portions of whatever I'm making so I can freeze and reheat it later. I make lots of homemade soups in my larger Instant Pot but love this 3 quart for making smaller portions, especially steel cut oats for breakfast or a rice dish for dinner."
2.0 out of 5 stars,"When the InstantPot works, it's one of my favorite ways to cook. Unfortunately, the inner seal, which is made of rubber is pretty cheap. It often results in the seal not staying in its place within the lid, which then causes the instant pot to be unable to seal. Once it's unable to seal, you sit around and wait for it to heat up, which can take 15-20 minutes, only to realize it was all for nothing as it cannot seal and cannot pressure cook. You repeat this process several times and maybe it works and maybe it doesn't. I would love to use it more, but due to it's poor craftsmanship, it now sits mostly unused and I use a more dependable crockpot."
1.0 out of 5 stars,"I loved my original DUO60 7-in-1 and when I accidentally killed it after a two-year love affair, I wanted the same model.  And apparently it's an ""Improved Version"".  It is NOT improved. I absolutely HATE this one. I have nothing but trouble with it...not coming to pressure, burning, really REALLY hot...what changed? Unfortunately, I can no longer return it (bought it 63 days ago).  I'm just so disappointed...especially with all the raving I've done to everyone I know, telling them they had to get one.  My original IP would get 10 stars from me. My 3-qt IP gets 10 stars. This one gets ZERO."

5.0 out of 5 stars,"My beloved Cuisinart Pressure cooker had a badly scratched and dented cooking pot and new one is more than half the cost of new appliance! Ridiculous right?  I've been hearing about the Instant Pot and it's modern technology so I decided on Duo Plus after some research. I wanted the cake and egg setting and I wanted the feature that holds the lid in the side handle. Ergonomics matter!I LOVE LOVE LOVE this pot!It has a nice nice display that tells you it's On. I got perfectly steamed hard cooked eggs in 5 min (I used the 5/5/5 method), I can use metal trivets, tools and steamers in the stainless steel pot, and throw it in the dishwasher later!The yogurt feature- wow! I used to make it in my crock pot but it was tricky and I would often burn my milk during the ""scald"" stage. No more baby! It boils the milk for you and then maintains the correct incubation temperature for however long you want. It took me a couple tries but I got a good batch of homemade yogurt. No more wrapping my crock pot in towels.The display is really nice and clear. You can tell what function is being used and when pressure is set. The diagram on kid shows you what direction the ""steam release"" valve needs to be. All around thoughtfully designed. Haven't tried cake yet. I need to get a pan. I could probably have paid less and just gotten the Duo but I figured if I'm gonna upgrade then I'm gonna upgrade!"

Except..... after just less than 12 months use, the element burnt out.I raised a trouble ticket with Instant Pot, but they never got back to me.I updated the ticket with a request to contact me - nothing!I updated the ticket again. I asked them again to contact me to see what could be done.They closed the ticket without contacting me.I've sent them emails, raised trouble tickets...nothing.Customer Service is an absolute joke...which is a shame as I would've bought another unit, as when they work, they're awesome, but if it breaks, you're most definitely on your own!Beware of this company... all care, no responsibility!"

1.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought this primarily for the pressure cooking feature.  I constantly get the BURN error message.  If I try to saute and then pressure cook, forget it, no chance it will come up to pressure.  The BURN error message comes on at least 75% of the time I try to use this.  I've even tried recipes from the best selling cookbooks, following the exact methods outlined, and still get the BURN error message.  I've researched this thoroughly, and it is a known issue.  There are countless tips out there on how people are trying to avoid the BURN message (not enough liquid, too thick, using tomato products, wrong day of the week, etc.), however it seems inevitable.  This product was a total waste.  After multiple ruined meals because it doesn't comes up to pressure and flashes this error message, this hunk of junk went into the dumpster."

I now have a pressure cooker that leaks pressure. Go buy from Costco or Sams, at least a reputable dealer. DO NOT BUY FROM THIS SELLER!"
3.0 out of 5 stars,"Buy the cheaper one. Although this has more functions on the menu, you barely use them. Every recipe you look for will feature the time and pressure level. No need for more buttons at all but it is a really nice cooker. Just as good as the cheaper model."

The UPS driver told me he delivers these all the time so asked his wife to order one. he said they love it and feels good each time he delivers one, knowing people will have the same reaction. The Instant Pot brand is unique in that it statutes. We use that feature a lot. Cook your unpeeled potatoes and eggs in shells in this thing and you will be creating the best potato salad you've ever eaten. It tastes like....potatoes! Don't get me started on the beef stroganoff, stews, soups, rice and chops, etc., etc."
3.0 out of 5 stars,"I've wanted an Instant Pot for a while now, mainly for brown rice and steel cut oats. Anything to help prepare them faster and with more consistent results. I opted for the 3 quart model since I usually make only two servings at a time. Unfortunately, after reading the included manual and recipe book, both brown rice and steel cut oats are best cooked on the ""Multigrain"" mode, which isn't in the 3 quart model!I called Instant Pot and they recommended using ""Pressure Cook"" instead. Supposedly the only difference in the ""Multigrain"" mode is a ""warm pre-soak"" before the main cycle. I've made a few batches of both long grain brown rice and steel cut oats and they seem to come out fine. But it's hard to say if they'd be even better with the proper multigrain setting. 🤷‍♂️Be great if it was clear that this mode is not in the 3 quart version BEFORE you purchase it. Even in the comparison chart on Instant Pot's site, they don't call out ""Multigrain"". You kind of have to dig to find official word that it's not available."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have had my instant pot now for a few days and I am absolutely in love!If you are reading reviews trying to figure out if you should buy one or not here is my opinion after research and my own trial and error!Why Instant pot over other brands? Instant put is stainless steel on the inside .. not non stick. you don't have to worry about cooking your food in chemicals or worry about the nonstick coating wearing down and into your food.I would recommend getting the 6qt unless you have a huge family i could see the 8qt however the 8 qt is quite big and may be bigger than most would care for. We are a family of 3 and the 6qt is way more than enough for us or even for a family of 5!If you feel scared, overwhelmed, intimidated... that is NORMAL. There is so much information it is complete information overload. You may even feel like ""what the heck did i get myself into ?"" when going through the directions.  Breath- take it slow- youtube some videos if needed or if you have Facebook look for the instant pot Facebook page- you will find many nice and helpful people there to help you!Some tips on getting started..Be sure to start out with doing the water test.. it will test to make sure your pot is functioning correctly, it will steam clean the inside for you before your first venture and it will even help ease the nerves a bit too.Start with something easy... like hardboiled eggs! I have done 3 batches of hardboiled eggs in the past 5 days! They are so incredibly easy,  taste SO good and they are SO easy to peel! I do the 5-5-5 method. 5 minutes on high pressure cook, 5 minutes natural release (leave it alone for 5 minutes it will count up to L 5  manually release the rest at that point ) and put into an ice bath for 5 minutes. PERFECTLY hardboiled eggs!2nd I made something easy but more difficult... Homemade Mac and Cheese  IN TEN MINUTES! it only took 10 minutes to make homemade mac and cheese! The family loved if.. i don't think i can go back to Kraft...3rd.. I wanted to try meat and a bit more of a challenge... I made this most amazing meatloaf ever.I still get nervous and feel overwhelmed and second guess myself. I can't wait to be so comfortable with it i am willing to experiment and do my own thing... I am not there yet but the learning curve is worth it. This is life changing!For cleaning, you will need to clean the different pieces which can be a pain but its the sanitary thing to do, don't be lazy :) The Stainless steel insert is dishwasher safe.. if you find you are having a hard time with burnt on food a good soak in hot water and soap and it comes off easy.. for anything REALLY burnt on you can scrub with bar keepers friend. The cover you will want to wash by hand. I was the silicone ring by hand too.. not sure if you have to but i do.... don't forget to wash the plastic drip collector thing.. if you forget about cleaning that.. it may be growing your own science project.... gross."
1.0 out of 5 stars,"First the good part: it really works and works very well. The snacks I tried that are usually fries came out crispy and nice being air fried. The setup and using is quite simple and the on board buttons are intuitive, like the Instapot itself.That said the people who did the industrial design of this thing are possibly rank idiots and looks like they never talked to their electrical engineers. The fryer top has its own power supply and cord. It is designed to take up an entire outlet (top and bottom) to avoid overloading the circuits. This makes total sense. So you’ve got to plug this thing into a wall outlet and find another one in the kitchen to plug the instapot itself.Now here’s the kicker: the power chord for this kid is just about 3 feet and with the instapot also with less than 3 feet of cable you better have two outlets in the kitchen that are with 6 feet of each other. In spite of finding such spots mine is set at a crooked angle and is sitting dangerously on the counter with no slack on either cables.Design thinking and execution at its stupidest!"
1.0 out of 5 stars,"Worked about 3 times. Hqs power, but none of the buttons will work. I asked the manufacturer for an answer and they said more info was being released in about 2 weeks.  In the mean time, I have missed the return window and now I am out $80 for this piece of garbage that doesn't work. I also had to buy a second instant pot to try and get this led to work because it wasn't even compatible with my 1st 1. For what I've spent on trying to air for I, I could have bought a ninja foodie and only had to deal with 1 appliance. Disappointed in this air fryer lid, but really like all of the other functions that I have already used on my instant pots. I just would not recommend this lead until they figure out how to make it work right."
1.0 out of 5 stars,"I tried the lid as soon as I got it. I was so excited. However my chicken was taking forever to cook!  So I threw a temperature gauge in with the chicken and even though I had the lid set to air fry 380 the temperature inside was only at 200 degrees after 30 minutes. After 40 minutes it was at 250 degrees. I don’t think this will air fry anything at these temps. I have asked for a replacement, we will see how that works. So disappointed."

5.0 out of 5 stars,"For my first try, I took a 3.5 lb beef roast out of the FREEZER one evening, put it into the Duo+ 60 Instant Pot with potatoes and carrots and had a perfectly delicious dinner in less than 2 hours.  I LOVE that the lid and stainless steel inner pot can be put in the dishwasher. I like that the cord detaches from the unit because I can put everything inside to keep it all together. It also came with two relatively small plastic utensils. (I think one of them is actually supposed to be a trivet, but I'm not very experienced with these gadgets. Looks like another spoon to me.) This gets stored on the countertop because I use it too often to bother putting it in a cabinet. It's has a footprint of about 1 Sq ft. HOWEVER, I have to say that the first one I received had a DOA sensor and it took a couple of weeks to get a replacement from the manufacturer in Canada. In hindsight, I should have just exchanged it with Amazon instead of calling them. On the other hand, though, they didn't want the broken one back, so now I have an extra inner pot and lid. I suppose that was worth the wait. I don't have one yet myself, but I suggest the silicone lid accessory if you sometimes go straight to the fridge like I do. It probably works better than foil or plastic.I am NOT a seller or advertiser or paid/compensated in ANY way for my review. NOBODY asked me to write this. I made my purchase decision from reviews like this and other research and I paid full (Amazon) price for it with no regrets. Do your own due-diligence before making your decision. :-)"
2.0 out of 5 stars,"This thing is just too big for what I'd use it for.  The lid is so bulky that I'd have to store it somewhere besides the kitchen.  I love my Instant Pot, but I already make awesome chicken wings using the convection feature of my oven.  I did a head-to-head test of Tater Tots in the oven and using the air fryer lid and they came out pretty much indistinguishable from one another. Nice idea, just not for me I guess."
1.0 out of 5 stars,"I was hearing good things about this instant pot. I just moved so I discarded my old cooker and bought this.Somehow they didn't give me a power cord in the box and therefore I couldn't cook anything with it, which means at this time I have to eat out for every meal. I contacted their customer service, while they're trained to say things like ""Oh I understand your concern"", ""Don't worry I'll solve your problems for you"", the ""solution"" they provided is that a ticket has been created for me and a customer service expert will contact me through email and handle this. It's been a day since I contacted them and I heard nothing so far.I don't quite understand why this simple matter has to become so complicated -- all I need is that you send me a power cord, ASAP, so I CAN START COOKING. Now I have to wait for an email, and I have no idea when/if I can get my power cord."
1.0 out of 5 stars,"First off, HORRIBLE customer service!!! They have quite possibly the worse customer service I've encountered. My pot I  believe was defective,  it was not sealing and customer service would not respond at all to my requests. I'd only had for about 2 weeks. Luckily Amazon is amazing and everything worked out. I returned it and ordered a different brand and have not had one problem with it.  Horrible, unreputable company that does not stand behind their product. Also, the sealing ring gets a terrible odor if you cook with garlic or other aromatic ingredients and the flavor can seep into other dishes you make so you have to buy new rings which are not cheap, about $5 each. You could be investing quite a bit of money over time"
5.0 out of 5 stars,love the instant pot. 6 qt is my 2nd one.  had an 8 qt but too big for two people.  ordered this 6 qt because i really miss having one.  have not used this one yet because it arrived with the lid handle broken.  wrote to the company.UPDATE:  company says I must report to Amazon.  I did that bit I live full time in the rep. of Panama & cannot afford to SHIP this back to the USA.  a friend tried the IP & it works just fine.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I am in love! My first impression of the lid was that it felt heavy and heavy duty, like it’s going to last a while. My first time using I made crispy crowns. They cooked in half the time verses my oven and were nice and crispy with limited grease. I like that it beeps at you to rotate your food and it has a nice loud beep when it’s done. I also love that I can simply pull off the lid when I want to check on the food, no having to pause or stop or restart. Just pop the lid back on and it continues. Not to mention, it saves me room because I don’t have another huge appliance. Don’t walk, RUN. I highly recommend."
1.0 out of 5 stars,"We were excited about getting the 8 qt DUO....when we ran the initial water test however there was steam coming from the release valve continuously.  It failed.  We ran a second time and it worked.  We cooked with it twice and it failed again.  The company had us video the steam coming out which we did.  They also had us take a picture of the seal.  (don't know why since it was not leaking from the seal)  They finally had us return it to Amazon and said it was a pressure sensor problem of some kind.  In other words it was defective.  We ordered a second one which came faster than we could return the first.  We ran the water test again...and again....and both times it failed worse than the first unit.  THANK GOODNESS we ordered through Amazon as I suspect the second one will also be going back.  The question is, why try a third time.  Really disgusted  with what clearly is a manufacturing defect that effects multiple units...at least in our case  it happened with BOTH of them...."

5.0 out of 5 stars,"I went back and forth over buying one of these for a month but when my rice cooker finally died it was a done deal.  It’s AMAZING!  If you’re a normal size household 6 qt is more than enough... 8 would be overkill. Plus if you plan on leaving it out on the counter the 8 is huge.  I’ve made ribs (so freaking easy and delicious no more babysitting a smoker!) rice (omg the rice! We make sushi frequently... rinse the rice and use a 1:1 ratio) and bone broth! (4 hours instead of 24!) Coq au Vin white or red is delicious! making a whole chicken today then using the carcass for more bone broth - all in one pan!  You can sauté or sear all in the same pot then use the slow cooker or pressure cooker.  You can use any pressure cooker recipe and there’s soooo many!  Artichokes... best I’ve ever had, so evenly and perfectly cooked!  Yes the building and releasing  of pressure takes time but if it’s not the same amount of time it’s definitely better tasting.  The pot is stainless... so easy to clean.  You’ll love it just buy it."

5.0 out of 5 stars,"Having a wonderful time discovering all of the great stuff this thing will do. Love making perfect hard boiled eggs. Last night it accelerated boeuf burguignon nicely. Reheated a baked sweet potato for me. In no time flat today it steamed zucchini, potatoes and carrots for my supper. It is making short order of my extra veggies in the fridge. Tomorrow we will have ratatouille. Delighted that I found just the right sized glass lid to use for non-pressurized applications. The regular extra Instant Pot®️ accessories truly are overpriced, IMHO. I have a set of basichaus®️ silicone circular covers in assorted sizes that also work well; (you just cannot see through them, but the seal on the pot is excellent).Fortunately I have so much kitchenware that I can substitute most anything. I’m so glad it was the 8 quart DUO Plus that was on the Special of the Day. You can put LOTS of stuff into it all at once. I’m “keeping warm” my cooked veggies and leftover boeuf right now. DO watch all of the YouTube videos for new owners with excellent helps such as: the ends of the heavy lid fit into the handles to hold it out of your way and there is a little hanging hole on the rice paddle that can be used to release the pressure inside so you do not steam your fingers. I’m so eager to make a cheesecake and a regular cake — sounds so much fun. The one item that I decided I must buy is a pair of the gaskets for the pressure cooker top; one for sweet and one for savory. The scent of stew lingers despite washing and soaking. Off to try to discover how I can use the pressure cooker feature to make an authentic steamed plum pudding."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"Works as advertised. I’m still on the fence about the Instant Pot usage, not sure it’s worth the effort."
3.0 out of 5 stars,"This is good for a single person, not a family by any means. It is good for a max of about 12 chicken wings, or a handful of fries. That's about it. Remember you are inserting a smaller basket into the Instant Pot that is already pretty small. And as with all air fryers the food should not be touching to ensure airflow.I does work nice to get a crispy effect on your pressure cooked food that you otherwise would not have.  For instance if you cook a whole chicken, when it's done pop the air fryer lid on, run it for 20 minutes or so and your skin is now nice and crispy. I also did this for a BBQ pork roast, I wanted to get a crunchy bark on the outside after it cooked, worked great.But as a stand alone solo air fryer it really isn't worth it. Buy a larger unit dedicated to air frying."
1.0 out of 5 stars,Well I used this only 8 times and it's broken.  It won't pressurize or something.  I contacted Instant Pot and they want pictures of the ring inside.  If it is the ring then that reflects how cheaply this is made since I had used it only 8 times.  I tried to make brown rice and it's not doing anything.  I'm frustrated because we are beyond the return period through Amazon.
3.0 out of 5 stars,"I have used the traditional style cooker and I have a smaller electric cooker. This one blows both of those out of the water! The only thing I can say is the inner pot already has some water stains and some deep scratches in it which is surprising as it is supposedly stainless steel. I figured with it being ""stainless steel"" that I could mash my potatoes in the pot, hence that is where the scratches came from, so if you don't want scratches, don't use a mixer in it. Needless to say, I am not very happy with that, but it does perform well and has lots more room than the pc I had previously."

5.0 out of 5 stars,"I was skeptical.I have wanted an air fryer for so long, but don't really have anywhere to put one. Beyond that, I often make things in my Instant Pot that I end up transferring to the oven or elsewhere to crisp (or skip crisping and wish I did). I couldn't imagine having the IP and an AirFryer out.When the Mealthy crisp lid was released, I was tempted but decided to wait and see, and I went back and forth between the Mealthy, the IP Vortex Air Fryer and an air fryer I'd been eyeing at Aldi. I'd even toyed with selling my IP and switching to the Ninja Foodi and then to the IP Duo Crisp.In fact, two weeks ago I had the Aldi air fryer in my cart and my husband told me to wait a week and look some more online.Then I saw Jeffrey from Pressure Luck reviewing this lid and figured I would give it a shot. It is compatible with both of my Instant Pots, it was made FOR use with my pots. It looked idiot-proof. It was cheaper than every other option I was looking at.I have zero regrets. It has cooked everything wonderfully so far. I have because I am lazy,  even just dumped a full bag of frozen tater tots into the air fryer basket, set it for 20 minutes, given it a quick shake with some seasonings halfway through and they came out evenly crispy and as amazingly delicious as if they'd been deep-fried. So much better than in the oven, even on convection!Anything that makes my life easier with kids and school and work and sports and everything we have going on is a huge win for me."
2.0 out of 5 stars,"I wanted to throw away my crock pot, but not so fast. As a crock pot this thing cooks SLOW! Using this mode, should've started it yesterday. As a rice cooker, the water calculated in recipes didn't work. Burned rice first time and undercooked the second time. Instructions on how to use this are vague. After watching many You Tube videos, my buttons are different. Disappointed that I can't make any recipe using milk or cheese without several steps. Purchased the pot inserts to fix that problem, but they are so small, I can't cook for my whole family at once. Now I'm $100 dollars in, and I have a glorified pressure cooker. I already have a pressure cooker! In a perfect world, this would have given me precious cupboard space by tossing 3 appliances. Sadly no one in my family want it either. Do significant research before purchasing this, I wish I had."
1.0 out of 5 stars,"Bought in June 2019. Stopped working in October 2019. I treated it as I should and nothing appears broken. The pressure valve no longer rises and after it goes through the cook cycle, my food is still raw, just slightly warmed."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I kept hearing about electric pressure cookers but I always thought back to the noisy monster that mom used on our stove when I was a kid. The one that she wouldn't even allow me into the kitchen when she was using it. And that picture floating around Facebook of the pressure cooker lid embedded in someone's ceiling didn't help! But I read a lot of reviews and webpages and finally broke down and decided to try one.I bought a PPCXL from Costco and jumped in with both feet. I made several delicious meals using recipes from the web and I canned peppers, jam, and applesauce using recipes from the included book. Then I found out that electric pressure cookers are not safe to can with even though the PPCXL company said it was and included a recipe book for home canning. I ended up having to throw away everything I had already canned and that just annoyed me to the point that I didn't want a product from that company in my home so I returned it and ordered the Instant Pot Duo 7-in-1. I chose this one because a) the company specifically says this product is not safe for pressure canning, it has a stainless steel pot instead of non-stick, and it has the yogurt function.We’re trying to eliminate all non-stick cookware from our kitchen so going to the stainless pot here was a step in the right direction. I really didn’t think I would use the yogurt function much. I don’t dislike yogurt but it’s not something I ever wanted all the time either so I thought I’d try it once and then go back to buying the occasional container at the grocery store. I couldn’t have been more wrong! Even if I wasn’t cooking tons of other fabulous recipes in my IP, the yogurt feature alone has made the IP my one “can’t live without” kitchen appliance (I even took it RV camping with us!). The yogurt is crazy simple to make and so much healthier than the preservative and sweetener loaded stuff at the store. Milk and a starter (a tbsp. or two of yogurt) are all you need and the IP does all the work while you sleep!I could go on and on about the yogurt, but then I wouldn’t have time to write about all of the other things you can make. Dishes like Pineapple Pepper Chicken (less than 1 hour including ALL prep and cook time!), Jambalaya (also less than an hour!), and absolutely melt in your mouth fall off the bone ribs. Yes, RIBS! In less than an hour! Want to make some desserts? How about cheesecake or dulce le’ leche? Homemade hummus in less than an hour? Not a problem! Bread? It can do that too!This really is the most versatile appliance I own. And on those hot summer days when you don’t want to heat up the kitchen it’s a lifesaver! No more hot oven heating up the house for hours, just grab the IP!If you’re still reading, what are you waiting for? Order yourself this miracle gadget now!All of the attached photos are of food I've made in my Instant Pot. Pineapple Pepper Chicken, Crustless Quiche, Sausage & Spinach Scrambler, Beef Chili, Roasted Garlic Hummus, Sausage & Kraut, Boiled Peanuts, Yogurt, Jambalaya"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I cannot say enough good things about the Instant Pot. I have told so many friends and family members about it that they should be giving me a commission at this point (but, sadly, they don't).  I used to use the crockpot fairly often since I work pretty long days and wanted something ready and hot when I got home. The problem I found with the crockpot was that a lot of things end up tasting the same no matter what you do. That is not the case with this!!! Not only can you use it as a crockpot and maintain the integrity of the ingredients you put in somehow, you can do so much more. I have made my own Greek yogurt, you can saute ingredients first (only ONE pot messy!!), and cook things in the most delicious way in record time. We cook at home about 6 nights a week, and at least 4-5 of those nights now involve the Instant Pot. It is great for meal prep and so. much. more. This is a MUST have kitchen accessory for anyone who wants to cook with convenience."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"Just got the duo plus and the buttons shown on this pot and what is shown on this page on amazon are not the same arrangement. Where Amazon got the picture shown, is beyond me. Picture to follow soon! Update 12/5/19 the instructions that came with this are awful.. NO explanations on what the icons on the display mean. Nothing included except a little clear condensation cup and a small little metal rack that sets inside on the bottom how cheap can we be. I could not find the condensation cup, because it was the same color as the clear bag the pot came in. I was lucky to find it. I'm starting to think this instant pot, is maybe, an instant pain the the you know what!. So far on my first try I  got burn food and steam was coming out all around on the sides upon using this! Why I'll tell you why! Because there are no detailed instructions to look too and this is not a toy item I cant believe they dont pack better instructions with this item! Don't quote me on this but I think your suppose to use at least 2 cups of water with this I could be wrong who knows. I hope things get better but my oven is looking  real good right now.  Will update this review as I go along.."
1.0 out of 5 stars,"Unfortunately it isn't compatible with all electrical outlets. It's very powerful and can blow a fuse in older homes. Plus you absolutely can not use an adapter or a surge protector.  There are two reasons I had to give it one star. One, you can't leave a review without leaving a star rating. I didn't want to. Second, I can't rate something I never used."
1.0 out of 5 stars,"I have to repaint my kitchen after using this thing! Bean juice leaking out the back, steam escaping out the top, takes 3 times hitting the beans setting (1 and 1/2 hours) to pressure cook beans, and sometimes so much liquid leaks out that they burn. The low temp setting cannot cook beans in 7 hours time. Very slow customer service, it took me a month of emailing to get a plastic piece for the back that they had forgotten to put in the original purchase, and with this installed it still leaks. My husband has been begging me to throw this thing out before it ruins our house. Ver disappointed. I don't understand all the good reviews."
1.0 out of 5 stars,"I am writing this review with much dismay. I have had this for a few months now, and i always enjoyed making new recipes - but the allotted cooking time isnt accurate at all. Most recipes suggest it will take 8-12m for 2 chicken breasts. Even frozen is under 15m. But not for mine - from get-go it has taken anywhere from 35-1h to cook two thawed chicken breasts that i cut in half. Half way through id slice them in half again before seeing how pink they are inside. I went to contact customer service on their site, and there are errors all over the place and a complaint cannot be sent. There are other customers complaining about lack of support for over a year and none of them have even been helped yet.If it takes over 30m to cook in an INSTANT-pot, then i might as well go back to oven, shake-n-bake or a skillet type meal. DISAPPOINTING.i cannot further recommend this product, and i regret suggesting a family member buy one. - at least theirs works currently."
1.0 out of 5 stars,"I was in love with my instant pot the first few months. And then I got “the burn”... Apparently this is a thing, based on other reviews I’m seeing now. Anything I cook without the trivet - which is 99% of what I used to use it for burns. I’m talking about wet things like soup-having enough water is *not* the problem. I follow the instructions to cool it down & it immediately burns again. I purchased this about 9 mos ago & stopped using it about 6 mos age.I rated the easy to clean aspect as 3... the insert cleans up quite easily with soap & water (even the burnt stuff!) But trying to clean the rim where the lid sits down in it to seal is kind of a pain. But that may be par for the course with any pressure cooker. I like that it doesn’t have a nonstick application but is still easy to clean.I wish I could write a better review, but what can you say when you can’t use something for exactly what it’s supposed to be made for??"
1.0 out of 5 stars,"After reading rave reviews of the mini, mine is going back. I'm waiting for a new one, hoping the one I'm returning is just a fluke.I tried to saute some onions and they never got golden, just mushy. The saute function wasn't hot enough.I tried to use it as a slow cooker. After waiting 8 hours on high, the food wasn't cooked and had only reached a temperature of 150 degrees F.I switched it over to pressure cook for 30 min to try to finish the chili and it still didn't cook the beans.I kept it on warm for 45 min. and the temperature was only at 117 degrees F.Hopefully the new one that's on its way will work because these temperatures are no where near where the instruction booklet says they should reach."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"I figured the 3 qt would be fine for a 1-2 person household.  And most of the time it is.  But it really only has a 2 qt capacity.  It is hard to find accessories that fit the 3 qt since it has a smaller inner diameter than the 6 qt.  I have trouble fitting ""all in one"" recipes such as beef stroganoff or pot roast into the 3 qt.  For the former, I have to cook the pasta separately, which loses some of the flavor.  For the latter, I have trouble fitting the potatoes and carrots in on top of the meat.  And trying to do PIP in the 3 qt is more difficult.  You can always cook less in a larger pot, but are often limited by size of the mini.  All in all, I love the purchase but wish I had gotten the standard 6 qt."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love this 3 qt instant pot! I also own a 6 qt, 6 in 1 instant pot but felt that I needed a second instant pot to make sides while making dinner in the larger pot. The 9 in 1 pot has a lot more features than my 6 in 1.  I did not use my larger pot to make hard boiled eggs but decided to try it out in this pot using the egg button. The eggs are perfect every time and peel very easily.  I have also successfully made coconut milk yogurt in this pot using the yogurt button. I did need to purchase a different steamer basket and cheesecake pan to fit in the 3 qt pot due to its small size.  I like the 9 in 1 so much that I am considering upgrading my 6 in 1."
1.0 out of 5 stars,"It’s been a few years now since I purchased this. Let me just say, I’m a huge instant pot lover. I’ve had the 6 quart for 7 years, and it’s still going strong. We use it so often that we decided to buy the 8 quart. I’ve had problems with this since the beginning. It doesn’t seal properly, taking multiple times and troubleshooting to get the IP to just come to pressure. By the time we get through this, It’s kind of pointless to even use it. Now, just a few years later, it’s dying. It takes an extremely long time to come to pressure, even to sauté veggies. Really bummed out. Not sure if I just Got a lemon, I’m assuming that’s what it is. My 6 quart is still working wonderfully, though!"
1.0 out of 5 stars,"I had this Instant Pot for 2 years and used it four times, nothing messy.  Worked great.  Tried it the other day & it wouldn't warm up.  Everything else is ok, lights up.  I looked on YouTube and I'm not about to take the elements out and solder parts.  Contacted the sellers.  I realized my warranty ran out, I just asked them if they knew anyone in my area that could look at it, fix it.  I would pay....just needed a recommendation.  They wouldn't accommodate me.  Apparently they have these rules and they can only recommend warranted repair people if the item is still under warranty.  They actually said to buy a new one.  I don't think so.  Now I have this nice clean looking pressure cooker that is useless.  I'll probably call around small appliance repair shops but didn't appreciate Instant Pot customer service.  Will never buy from them again."
3.0 out of 5 stars,"It will take you a while to get the hang of this. The cooking times do not account for the heat up and steam release time. When these are added to the cook time, most things are in no way instant. I have also had trouble getting foods done. I am close to sea level, so I don't think I should have to add time, but always use the longer end of time ranges but sometimes I still have to restart the cooker for 5-10 minutes because my food is not done.I do like it better than my crock pot. The temperature controls on the newer models usually overcook if you don't keep a close eye. Another advantage of the InstantPot over the crock pot is that it doesn’t require as much planning in advance.I would recommend getting multiple seals because the seal gets stinky fast if you cook chicken with skin on. I bought the color coded ones for when I attempt to do a non-savory dish. Another inner pot would be handy too if you want to store food in it or cook one thing then the next in short order."
1.0 out of 5 stars,"This was a great thing to have in the kitchen for the two months it worked and then it stopped sealing. I sent in a warranty request, complete with all the information and pictures the instructions asked for, but the only response from the company was basically instructions to conduct like 15 separate tests (with pictures) and then send them the results, and then (only then) would they maybe replace the unit. I don't have time for this. Poor customer service."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Absolutely love it.  I have only used it once (made Indian Butter Chicken), and realizing how beneficial and convenient this is, I've decided to buy all 12 of my employees who are all very busy working mothers there.  I'm going as far as preparing all the meals for our Xmas party with it so that after they open their gift I'll be able to brag that all meals they ate that night were cooked with the IP."

4.0 out of 5 stars,"I have had the Instant Pot for 3 years, and use it on average at least once per week -- mostly to make broth or stew. And it has worked flawlessly. But a few months ago as I was removing the condensation collector, I felt a small snap. I was thinking, ""Ok, maybe the collector has gotten brittle and the plastic broke.""After closer inspection the thing that broke was one of the thin plastic tracks into which the condensation collector slides. The condensation collector I could replace. But I couldn't replace the plastic track because it is attached to the pot. It is a really poor design. So now I just tape the collector to the pot (see picture)."

5.0 out of 5 stars,"I was swayed by the positive reviews for this item and wow I'm glad I bought it.This is probably one of the best things I've bought on Amazon - probably the best.I decided to make my own curries since I could never buy them exactly how I like them. After a couple of attempts, I can now make a daal and also a lamb saag to restaurant quality. I use this thing for everything and usually by the 2nd attempt of something its close to being how i want it - because it's so easy to use.Sauces do not separate.Rice cooked to perfection.Can cook chickens from frozen!Saute option means you can do everything with this pot alone. Seriously you don't need a stove.Vegetables are crunchy and a sinch.It just goes on and on,It just works.Cleaning is easy peasy. The metal tin inside is great to clean.I don't think I will ever be without one of these or something like it - ever.Amazing amazing product."
1.0 out of 5 stars,"First, the Instant Pot is so overrated.  I'm embarrassed for falling for the hype.  However, I was going to try to make it work (and save face.)  After the first use and cleaning, the seal/gasket smells so disgusting I couldn't leave it in any kitchen cabinets.  Yes, I did all the recommended tricks to get rid of smell.  No amount of white wine vinegar, lemon rind, steaming or Voodoo would kill that smell.  More importantly, we shouldn't have to take extra steps to make it tolerable after even one use.  The Instant Pot was supposed to be about convenience and time saving, right?  I want my money back, but I'm pretty sure I'm just stuck with it.  BE SMARTER THAN ME.  STAY AWAY!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"You may think pressure cookers are useful mainly for cooking tough cuts of meat in a short period of time. And they are great for that, but they are SO, so good for vegetarian meal prep as well. I had purchased a bunch of Rancho Gordo heirloom beans, but they had been sitting in my pantry for 6 months. I never think to pre-soak beans the day before I want to cook them. I'm not good with planning ahead, I guess. With the instant pot, I can throw un-soaked, dry beans into the pot and they're ready in less than an hour. It also helps me cook rice in minutes without resorting to using boxed, sodium-laden instant rice. Lentils are also a breeze.I even use them when I'm just feeling super lazy. It only takes 10 minutes to boil pasta or steam veggies on the stovetop, but when I don't feel like waiting for water to boil or I don't want to clean a pasta pot and a sauce pot, I dump even these quick-cooking things in my Instant Pot mini and I literally have dinner on the table in 5 minutes. 10 minutes if I add sliced mushrooms and greens to my pasta. So easy. I got mine on a great deal - I think it was a returned or refurbished model, but it works great, and as a single person I'm glad I got the mini. Haven't missed the size of the larger pot at all, but it can take some trial and error to adjust recipes down to this size. Don't worry if the first few recipes turn to mush, keep at it and you'll find what works for you and what to avoid making in this."
1.0 out of 5 stars,"I was so Excited to order this Popular InstaPot.  I was upgrading from a Farbreware 6qt to this 8qt. After using 3 times and adding recommended water. The Unit kept giving me the BURN Message. This was very Frustrating and Disappointing in this Design Flaw using Stainless Steel vs Non-Stick. I cook the same meat in my Farberware with no Liquid and no problem. Adding water turn the ""gravy"" I want into soupy thin Liquid.  So Please Design with Non-Stick Pot. I Decided to buy the Fabreware 8QT and Very Happy. N0 More ""Burn"" message."
1.0 out of 5 stars,"This thing does not work... time and again, when you make a recipe (rather than just making plain rice)... we get 'burn' reading and it will not get up to pressure. We are stuck late in our dinner planning with a recipe that cannot be cooked. We have tried everything... layering, Instant Pot recipes, more water,. different cooks... and time and again, we cannot count on this device. This replaced our normal pressure cooker that worked fine (so we know how to pressure cook). So incredibly disappointed to have to write a 1-star review for something we so much wanted to love."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"Am enjoying my Instant Pot. My only complaint is that it came with practically no instructions. They tell you how to clean everything but not how to operate it, hence the 4 stars. And the two cookbooks I ordered tell you to use settings mine doesn’t have. You’re expected to go online for any help you might need and trying to juggle a phone and apply what it says in the middle of preparations is not my cup of tea. I’m learning little by little from trial and error. I think I will eventually love it but it’s been a trying start."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I really love this appliance.  I have replaced my rice cooker and egg cooker, and put my large crock pot into storage.  This thing does all those things and more.  And, as a single person, the size of the Mini is perfect.  I still get leftovers, but not days and days of leftovers.  The stainless steel pot is so much easier to clean than my crock pot, both in the sink and the dishwasher.  I think I will be using my Instant Pot at least once a week for a long time."
1.0 out of 5 stars,"I do not know what plastic material used for the sealing ring. After a few usages, it generated a very bad smell. The smell is so disgusting and penetrated into the food. I cannot eat cooked food at all. The food is not acceptable. I bought new sealing rings from the vendor's official website. They smell the same.I am wondering whether the decomposed material fall into the food is poisonous or not.I have had many rice cookers for the past 40+ years (rice cookers have two sealing rings, too). None of them has the same smell."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I just got this and have only tried a couple of things with it. But so far, I'm loving it! I tried french fries and they turned out super crispy and delicious. I only did a small quantity in a single layer, which isn't very much in a smaller pot like this. I wonder how they will turn out with a bigger quantity. I will update my review after I try that. I also made carnitas and it was fabulous! I used the broil function for that and it worked beautifully. The recipe was from Pressure Luck (search for Pressure Luck Carnitas), if you're interested. It was super tasty!Be aware that the plug has a plastic doo-dad on it that covers the other outlet. So only this item can be plugged in at one time on a power outlet. I'm guessing it must draw a lot of electricity and that is why it is designed as is. Not a big deal for me. The lid is pretty bulky, so also be aware of the space needed for storing it. I did some rearranging to make space for my new, awesome accessory!"
4.0 out of 5 stars,"I love my 8-quart Instapot! I have used a pressure cooker since I was a teenager and the Instapot is the best of the best. Push button features make preparing specific food types so easy. EASY TO PEEL hard-boiled eggs in 15 minutes. Toughest of meats come out fork tender. If you haven't bought one yet, buy one now. You won't regret it!  UPDATE:Today I tried using the Instapot slow cooker function. I put a spiral sliced ham in at 10 am on high for 4 hours. After 4 hours the brown sugar had not even melted and the pineapple juice was only warm! My Rival Crockpot that is 20 years old cooks a ham up perfectly. I don't recommend the Instapot's use as a slow cooker. I deducted one star because of this issue."
2.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought this to replace an air fryer and to minimize the amount of appliances I have. Cooks much slower than my last air fryer, and stirring food is a bit of a challenge. The insert holds alot of food, but it is very deep and doesnt cook evenly. What took me 4 or 5 minutes in the air fryer takes 9 or 10 in this one because of the uneven cooking and constant stirring. I have not used the other features yet, maybe I will change my mind..."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Now we’re talking...!!! This Mini Instant Pot Duo is even better (for me) than the full sized one, and here’s why - smaller footprint - same stellar results! Added bonus: I don’t over eat all week long, trying to put away 1/2 gallon of chili or soup - not to mention that pulled pork pile! Wow...  Received promptly with Prime, unboxed, pressure tested and on to soft boiled eggs bliss - all in under 10 min! (4 for the eggs btw). I previously purchased the Bluetooth controlled unit - which is cool - but the app is pretty weak. They could kill at that if they followed the Joule App’s approach! If you are single - or perhaps a couple, in an apt or tiny house - or, or - wanna take this camping...huh?!?! (I am totally taking this camping!!! :) Buy this and use it every day - I do! Brilliant little product that easily earns a place on my counter top! Did I mention it’s so cute? Tiny almost... 👍"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Wow.  Why did I wait so long?  I had seen lots of rave reviews for the Instant Pot, but I was reluctant to add one more specialized kitchen gadget that would get shoved further and further back on the shelf until I forgot I even owned it.  However, someone had posted a review praising it for use in an RV.  We've got an RV.  So I bought the mini 3-quart size.  And I love it.  I love one-pan and one-pot meals that include both meat and vegetables.  I've made a number of recipes that I found online and also combined ideas from some recipes to invent my own.  For most meals I brown the meat in the pot on the sauce setting, then throw in everything else and turn it on.  It's incredible how fast everything cooks and the flavors blend beautifully in just a few minutes.  This will greatly expand our repertoire of meals in the RV, but right now I'm already using it a couple of times a week at home.  The mini size is just right for the two of us-- usually we eat it all, or sometimes we have a meal and a small amount of leftovers to freeze or refrigerate.  One of my better purchases."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I got my instant pot from the warehouse deals section, and although it had a big dent in the side, it was just a little ugly and the device worked fine. This is my first instant pot, and seeing it in action has me really pumped to get a full size Max model in a couple months! A big question a lot of people have who don't have instant pots is ""So, it's a pressure cooker. Old manual models can do that, so what makes an overpriced hunk of electronics worthwhile?"" THIS THING DOESN'T HISS! Like at all! I was so shocked. I had an old stovetop model and was prepared for the hissing of the weight, and was very confused when I didn't hear my little machine hiss, but sure enough, the float was up. A hour later, no noise, I hear a beep and this thing starts depressurizing. Lo and behold, it actually pressure cooked without any noise or steam spraying everywhere. If I had to guess, the temp sensors in the pot allow it to only give the unit the exact amount of thermal energy it needs for the pressure, so it doesn't go spitting out steam. Either way, pressure cooking without hearing hissing behind me or worrying about steam damaging the cabinets the whole time will be huge in my house. I also tested the saute function a little bit. High heat does a really good job of getting a sear on meat while low is really great for a simmer that doesn't boil over."

Put it in the oven @ 200 degrees and it's finally cooking."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"At first, I wasn't sure about all the fuss surrounding the Instant Pot. When I thought about pressure cookers, I thought of my grandmother standing over a stove, canning vegetables from the garden. Boy, was I wrong! This is hands down my new favorite kitchen appliance, and it has saved me so much time in the kitchen. Let me tell you: The Instant Pot is a total game changer for time-starved cooks, working moms, and anyone who doesn't have time to stand over a stove waiting for a pot to boil.In the month or so that I've been using it, I've made a huge batch of 1-minute quinoa, steel cut oats, homemade refried beans, shredded salsa chicken, hardboiled eggs (for snacking & egg salad), tender thin-sliced steak and brown gravy, and even gluten-free pasta with meat sauce (all in one pot!)It's not always that the IP takes less time (because there is some time involved in coming up to pressure and releasing the pressure), but it's that you can walk away while the magic happens. It automatically kicks over to a warming function after cook time ends, so if you get busy doing something, your food will stay nice and warm!  (I actually picked up a rotisserie chicken from our local supermarket one afternoon, and came home and put it in the Instant Pot on the KEEP WARM function until dinner time. How awesome is that?)It's been really useful for meal prep, too! I am a big fan of cook once, eat twice type meals, and the IP is nice because a big batch of beans, quinoa, brown rice, soup, etc. doesn't necessarily take any extra time to cook. I was able to freeze single servings of quinoa, rice, beans, etc. to use on nights when I don't have time to cook.There IS a learning curve when it comes to figuring out cooking times, converting recipes, etc., so I recommend joining the Instant Pot group on Facebook, following some food bloggers who share IP recipes, and downloading all the Kindle Unlimited books that you can get as you learn how to use it. Start with something simple, and you'll get the hang of it pretty quickly.I've also heard a lot of people complain in FB groups about the silicone rings smelling like whatever you last cooked in the Instant Pot, so some people suggest having two rings: one for sweet and one for savory foods. It certainly doesn't affect the flavor of your food (at least, not in my experience) but if that bothers you, you might want to snag an extra silicone ring when you buy your IP.Overall, I am BEYOND pleased with my purchase and I am happy to share that dinnertime is a little easier at my house thanks to the IP!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought the DUO 6 quart because it offered both low and high pressure cooking. I saw the Bluetooth Instant pot, and I like technology, but...who's gonna put the food in it? lolI hate to cook. Been doing Blue Apron for a few months and I loved Blue Apron. I decided it was time to cook on my own, and boy is this the best appliance I have ever purchased. I have cooked more using the Instant Pot than I ever have. Seriously, I can't believe the flavor of the food. The first thing I made was chicken thighs with carrots, celery, and onions. In 20 minutes, I had a meal that was so tasty even my daughter was impressed (knowing how I cook). The chicken was tender, the carrots were soft not mushy, and the flavor was incredible. When I would use a crock pot, everything I made was mushy and it all tasted the same.The food I made in the Instant Pot was so good, that 3 of my friends bought it too, one bought the 8 quart. The stainless steel pot, along with parts being available thru Amazon is why I chose this one. There are great websites dedicated to Instant Pot, that makes finding recipes a breeze. The best thing I have figured out is this.... Find a recipe you like and use the ingredients you like, just follow approx cook time. Easy really. The user manual kinda overwhelmed me, until I realized it was in several languages..lol After you read it, go to page 17 and do the water test. (I saved the water for my house plants) Then get cooking.Clean up...I have Farberware stainless steel I received as a wedding gift (lots) of years ago and when I burned things, was a pain to clean. But I knew I did not want a Teflon pot insert. You can saute' right in the stainless steel pot, and then close it up to pressure cooks. Surprised to say, this is easy to clean, especially after I learned to ""deglaze"" it...Don't laugh...  :)Occasionally I put in dishwasher just to disinfect. I found that I am using the manual mode way more than any programmed buttons.I can't recommend it enough, from someone who really hates cooking. This is the start of my new years resolution to get healthy. According to Dr Mercola, steaming food is very healthy.  You will not be disappointed!Oh my...When I saw I could add pictures I was so excited.... Leg of lamb, Brussels sprout in 10 minutes and didn't stink up the house, fresh beets...17 minutes! Pork and Sauerkraut, I could go on. I really hope this helps anyone thinking about this pressure cooker. LOVE IT!I'm buying an air fryer next....for the crispy things...healthy crispy things.. Have a great time cooking in this Instant Pot, it has changed my life."
1.0 out of 5 stars,"After several uses a vacuum would develop between the lid and the inner pot during cooking, and food would not cook properly. Cleaning everything carefully did not resolve the problem. I tried replacing both the  sealing ring and inner pot, but this did not solve the problem either. I tried contacting Instant Pot's customer service, but they were very, very slow to respond and apparently work only from scripts. After two months of struggles I have completely given up on Instant Pot."
1.0 out of 5 stars,Everything I cooked in there turned into stew.  I’m a really well rounded cook in my home I’ve tried many different recipes in many different ways for the past 30 years I thought that this was going to simplify some of those things but unfortunately I am certain that this is something for someone who doesn’t know how to cook and they can throw it all in one big pot and not have to worry about standing over top of the stove or setting a timer or checking on it unfortunately it all comes out like mush.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I was already an instant pot fan, so seeing that they came out with an attachment, I immediately scooped it up. I have been wanting an air fryer, and the prospect of not having to store an extra machine was also a bonus. Since the product is so new, it doesn’t seem that there are many instant pot air fryer lids specific recipes, but after having done some research and having tried it out on brussels sprouts and chicken nuggets, it seems that you can just use any recipe fitted for an air fryer. There is really no learning curve like there was with using the instant pot for the first time. Essentially you just put the lid on top of your instant pot base, set the temperature, and go. The brussels sprouts came out perfectly crispy an amazingly delicious. The chicken nuggets I made for my daughter we’re done so fast, much faster than heating up my oven, and they two were crispy as if they had been fried. Great attachment for an already great kitchen appliance."
1.0 out of 5 stars,"I really wanted to love this product, but I REALLY don't!The main reason I bought this product is to be able to cook frozen chicken without defrosting (too many evenings I find myself at 6 p.m. still having not prepared dinner, and meat frozen-solid in the freezer). I did use this product to cook frozen chicken, but it comes out squishy and tasteless. I also used it to make spare ribs, and they came out squishy and tasteless. (Also used it to make beef schwarma rice....guess how it came out? If you answered squshy and tasteless, you'd be correct.)Oh, and to follow-up on my headline, this product CANNOT get fully clean. There are many foods it advertises that I'll never be able to use it for (yogurt, oatmeal, custard, mousse, cake, ....list goes on) because it will forever have the residual smells of grease from the meat I've cooked in it.!!WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT!!"
4.0 out of 5 stars,"I am a single man that lives in a garage apartment. I am also disabled with multiple health conditions. I used to eat sandwiches because I couldn't cook and that was the most effort I could put forth. On occasion, I'd microwave chicken nuggets or bake them in the oven with french fries. The Instant Pot has given me a lot more options to eat more healthfully. There is a learning curve, but there are so many videos on YouTube that you can just follow their recipes and end up with what they have. So far, I've made spaghetti, perfect hard boiled eggs, brown rice with black beans, and white rice with beans. I'm looking forward to this winter when I can make some ""dump and go"" soup recipes that I found on YouTube. Since I have high blood pressure and high cholesterol, this little device is helping me get away from processed foods and allowing me to control how much salt and oils I add into my food. I also purchased a set of meal planning containers so that I can ration out portion sizes. I wanted the 3qt since I'm a single man. It produces me with 2-3 servings of most items, but that will vary depending on what you're cooking. The price is high, but it's well worth it once you get over the initial hesitation.The downside: Cleaning the inner pot is simple if you pressure cook a 1.5 cups of water, a tablespoon of baking soda, and a teaspoon of dish soap (avoid the foamier soaps because it will escape when you do the pressure release).  Cleaning the rest of the pot is a little more of a hassle, but I've managed to do okay with just a damp rag. Try to avoid letting things dry on the exterior or interior and cleaning will be much easier."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"When Melissa Clark of the New York Times came out with a cookbook for this appliance, I gave in to the excitement; I bought Instant Pot 3 qt mini Duo Nova on Black Friday. It seems to be the right size for the two of us. I find that it does a superb job making beans and grains as well as soups; I make steel cut oats for breakfast, a new batch every few days. I like that convenience. I also made a yummy farro risotto with Italian sausage, black bean soup and a salmon recipe (Melissa) that gave me a ‘burn notice’ (the fish came out great, but the sauce burned.The caveat: don't expect this machine to be the be all, end all of cooking appliances. Preparing full meals? Most Instant Pot recipes instruct you to select 'Sauté', and brown things (onions, garlic et al) in the steel pot, then proceed with adding the remaining ingredients; then you allow the pot to come to pressure (about 15 min), it cooks for however much time the recipe calls for (5 min-30 min), allow for release (either let sit 10 min and release remaining pressure, or wait for the pressure to come down, up to ½ hour). All those things considered, it’s often easier to prepare entrées using stovetop or oven. Not much time is saved by using pressure. Another thing, the many Instant Pot cookbooks I’ve perused don’t have a lot of recipes I would care to prepare.To conclude: this is an excellent product; it's easy to use and gives good results. I gave that 5*, versatility gets 3*."
1.0 out of 5 stars,"Already have a Pressure cooker, but prefer a Stainless Steel pot, so I purchased this one.  The one I own is user friendly, did not need to read a book to learn how to use it.  This one, I could not get the lid on with pot inside.  So, I sat to read the booklet.  Did not help.  Seems it is damaged.  Followed all instructions exactly as described to no avail.  Seems to be very complicated.  Was trying to steam a sweet potato, to no avail.  2 minutes are viewed as 2 seconds."
3.0 out of 5 stars,"I love this product. It works great. The food turns out amazing and cooks so quickly. ***Reason for docking stars is that unfortunately  ..... the paint in bubbling up and chipping off the bottom of the fryer basket! I already informed Instant Pot but they said they don’t have any replacements available for the time being ( huh?) and will send a new one when available. So, I’m stuck worrying about paint getting into my food or not using it at all. If you get one of these, it says dishwasher safe- I wouldn’t..."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought the 8 qt instant pot for my husband and I. Although it is large for a meal for 2, I like the extra space when making homemade chicken & veg broth, soup, and pot roast. It's very easy to clean (I handwash) but it does absorb food odors which are hard to remove. My only complaint is that the steam release valve does not open as much as I'd like when quick releasing, which makes it not very quick. I have to manually hold the steam release open all the way so it can release in 2-3 min as opposed to 10. I brought this to to Instant Pot customer service and they said it's normal for the larger pots which i don't agree with. Do not buy this if you think it will help you make quick dinners...depending on the amount of food and liquid you have in there it can take up to 15-20 minutes to come to pressure + cook time + steam release time (again, if you have a lot of liquid and do a natural release this can take up to 30-45 minutes). But if you have some time it does a great job of infusing flavor in a relatively shorter amount of time.When making broth, I like that I can throw a chicken carcass, herbs, and veggie scraps in there and after 45minutes+natural release the chicken carcass is pretty much disintegrated and the herbs have all dissolved off of the stems and gives the broth great flavor."
1.0 out of 5 stars,"the beginning it was amazing, however i just bought it in February, and today is the April 1st, i did not even use this pot for more than 12 days... (imagine i do not cook with pressure cooker everyday... i only use it for 2-3 days/ per week), and it suddenly died....!!!!!!!  Now this should be covered by the warranty -- is there anyone who could help about this?!?!?"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Ever since I learned to make real Italian meatballs when I was a teenager, I've loved spending time in the kitchen. I enjoy creating recipes and watching people enjoy a delicious home-cooked meal. I'm not into fancy-schmancy gadgets, but I'll spend money for items that help me make good food. So, when I heard people raving about the Instant Pot recently, my ears perked up. But, I didn't want something that would just collect dust on my counter. Then I read the reviews and saw all the recipes online and decided to give it a try. Well, this baby is worth its weight in gold! I have used it every single day since I got it. I've made rice & beans, Creamy African Stew (see photos), steamed sweet potatoes, brussel sprouts, oatmeal, popcorn, veggie soup and so much more. My hubby is thrilled and so am I. It's so easy to use, there are so many free recipes online and clean up couldn't be simpler. A few people have bought the Instant Pot just from my recommendation. It's THAT good. I also bought the glass cover and an extra insert for when I want to make two things back-to-back. If you are on the fence, try it. It is so worth it!"
4.0 out of 5 stars,"Got the Instant Pot because I love my TimE Machine, but could not get a smaller size that 8 qt. Definitely wish I had noted how small this 3 qt. unit is. Only had it a short time, so cannot speak to durability or all of the great meals I hve made, but I expect to use it regularly for steel cut oats, rice and quinoa. I made chicken cacciatore and fit enough for 4 two portions, but a 6 qt probably would have been the sweet spot for my small household that likes leftovers. I like the ability to sauté veggies and brown meat and then cook it all together to finish the dish.  I found the need to reduce the sauce to thicken it after cooking, but I could do that by removing the meat and changing the setting to sauté with the top open. I will be cautious with the amount of liquid in the future. Definitely a learning curve, and I won’t be cooking everything in the instant pot, but see it as useful for a quicker meal, and great for the oatmeal and rice, things I want to “set and forget”."
1.0 out of 5 stars,"I got the mini pot to save space and because I cook only for one.  The one thing I really needed it for was to cook thick grains like spelt, faro etc.  Well.... Once I got it the instruction booklet and get ready to cook my grains, it happens to mention that the mini pot doesn't have that function. The other pots do. Would have been very important to realize before purchasing, waiting for delivery. Now have the hassle to return it and start all over again.  I am sure the pot works fine.  But I am giving it one star for not having that info right up front."
1.0 out of 5 stars,"This product does not work as advertised. Nearly everything I've tried to cook in it takes hours longer than it should because once the Instant Pot gets up to cooking heat and pressure a ""burn"" signal displays on the screen. It doesn't seem to matter how much liquid there is in the pot.Example - Yesterday I made beef stew in my Instant Pot. The cooking time described in the recipe I was following suggested 25 minutes. It ended up taking three + hours because the ""burn"" signal kept appearing on the display. At one point I emptied the contents in the inner pot to another container to see if the food was actually burning. Guess what, it wasn't. There was no burnt food on the interior. So I cleaned out the inner pot, let everything cool down for a while then returned the stew to the pot to give it another go and then ... no improvement. The ""burn"" signal appeared once again.I called Instant Pot's customer service and spoke to a gentleman who was very polite but utterly unhelpful in regards to this issue.There is nothing in the owner's manual about the ""burn"" signal. When I searched online the only advice I found was from other consumers who had the same problem and were left to come up with their own solutions.I would recommend that if you like slow cooked or pressure cooked food that you stay away from this product. It does not work as advertised, the owner's manual is a joke of a manual, containing little information about the pot and no information about the ""burn"" signal whatsoever.The food I've cooked int the instant pot has all been delicious however as I mentioned earlier it takes hours and a lot of maintenance to cook nearly anything."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"After almost a year, I can definitively say that this is one of my favorite kitchen electronics. As a mom of 6, I'm very busy and this takes a lot of pressure (no pun intended) off of me at mealtime. I have but one problem with it and that is the fact that it's not a good slow cooker. At all. I have tried it a few times and it has not done a good job. Low is more like warm, medium is very low, and high is more like a smidge above low. I have cooked things all day on high and the meat still isn't tender. The good thing is that it's a pressure cooker, so I just pressure cooker it at that point. But I wish it worked better. I bought this so that I could get rid of my rice cooker and slow cooker. But I wish I had kept my slow cooker now, because sometimes I just want to slow cook things and not have to worry with pressure cooking it too. As a rice cooker it does beautifully. If you are considering getting this appliance, I highly recommend it. But hold on to your slow cooker until you know if you need it. And check out Pinterest for recipes. There are tons out there!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I received my Instant Pot yesterday and this morning I read the instruction book, ran the test run, and found a website ""Pressurecookingtoday.com"" which gave me instructions for doing steamed pudding in my pressure cooker.  I have made persimmon pudding for the holidays for years, using an old Presto appliance which doubled as a deep fryer, and took 2-1/2 hours of steaming and having to add water at least once.  Today I made it in my Instant Pot in 60 minutes and it came out perfect.  So happy I bought this appliance.  Can't wait to try the next thing."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"So if you’ve ever considered buying an Instant Pot, DO IT.I got one today, and was cooking soup on the stove. I realized that the recipe called for cooked chicken, not raw chicken. So I pulled two chicken breasts out and set them in the Instant Pot and let it rip.SIX MINUTES LATER! I had two perfectly cooked, moist, tender chicken breasts. It took me longer to unpackage the Instant Pot than it did to cook chicken in it. This thing is insane. I love it."
1.0 out of 5 stars,"I decided to invest in this IP Duo Nova to keep in our RV to simplify cooking - apparently there are indefinite numbers of dish you can make with all the function it offers. Upon arrival I tried the water test and it passed the test. Next thing we tried was steaming rice - followed all instructions and came out OK, but our old rice cooker at home does the job better, since this rice came out quite mushy .Next use, decided to go all in and cook my first complete meal - Hungarian Goulasch (using the slow-cooker program). Prepped all ingredients and started the slow-cooker program on Low for 6-8 hours. Went on a hike all day in belief my food was being cooked, only to realize 8 hours later that the stew-meat was hard as a shoe-sole and the potatoes still raw. Couldn't wrap myself around it until I realized that the ""keep warm"" function lights on by default when selecting a program. My interpretation of this light being on while selecting a program was that the IP would keep the food warm upon completion of a program run. But that's not the case - actually - the light being on OVERRIDES the program to run. Merely, my ingredients had only been kept warm for 8 hours instead of slowly cooked. Very frustrating, no dinner that evening but decided to start over with the same batch and ensure the keep-warm button was OFF (only showing slow-cooker lit up, not both). Selected ""normal"" instead of ""low"" as I didn't feel it needed to cook as long worrying my food would build up bacteria.After 5 hours the stew meat and potatoes not cooked through, so increased to ""high"" for 2 more hours. No change. At this point, my food had stayed on medium temperature for too many hours that the risk of bacteria build up was too high and I didn't want to risk my family getting food poisoning. So I had to throw away the whole batch of goulash that my family was planned to enjoy at the end of a day of hiking.Stubborn as I am, I decided to start over the next day and cook a whole new batch on the slow-cooker program on ""high"" for 6 hours, with new meat and ingredients. It came out better than the day before, but by no means close to the tenderness of the beef-stew after slow-cooking it as my old slow-cooker at home.Have yet to try the pressure cooking programs, but must admit, at this point I have lost confidence in the product and am considering returning it. I'm worried about how many more batches of food it will ruin for me before I give up on it. Maybe it's not as versatile as marketed, it's probably just good at one thing - pressure cooking and that's it? Too early to say, will update this review once tried that option as well.For the purchase price, I wouldn't say it's worth it."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm just learning to use it, and finding it a little tricky to get timings right. I was hoping for more ""one-dish"" meals with veggies and meats, but in truth the cooking times for those things are all so different and if you use the pressure cooking (what I bought it for) you can't just add in the veggies later in the process like you can with regular crock pot cooking. So my veggies have been overdone thus far.  I do like it, and will keep trying, but the word ""instant"" is a bit of wishful thinking. Everything I've done in it so far took about as long as it would have taken to cook using regular methods, pretty much, by the time you allow for the unit to pressurize etc."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"So far, I only use it for pressure cooking.  I've owned an electric pressure cooker for the past 8 years.  My old one was a generic name but it finally bit the dust after the plastic vent release valve broke off.The Instant Pot is 8 qt instead of the 6 that I had before.  The size is definitely a huge plus.  Construction quality is very high.  The inner stainless vessel is really impressive quality.  The hood is well constructed.  It has a lot of plastic but I'll be sure not to drop it accidentally.  So far so good performance wise.  Unlike pressure cookers of olde, once pressure is reached, the cooking is silent.  Have yet to try out the other cooking modes but so far so good."
1.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought this thinking it would save me a lot of trouble and room in the kitchen due to its many supposed functions but it's caused a lot more trouble than anything else.First: note that you can use this to cook rice, but you have to use the pressure cook setting and rice does not come out as good as in a rice cooker.Also note that this is NOT autosensing. You would think that the different buttons for ""beans"" or ""soup"" actually do different things, but they don't.In fact, you will actually either burn your food or undercook it.The temperature of the slow cooker for example, does not get high enough, even on the ""high"" setting. I've tried to use the setting to cook things for 6-10 hours and have been left with barely heated through food. (Trust me, I'm not doing anything wrong).Actually, this whole thing doesn't work. Any recipe I follow specifically mentioning the instant pot burns the bottom or comes out wrong in some way. Mine doesn't seem defective; it just seems like a really crappy product for the price you pay. Save yourself the money and stay far away from the instant pot!!"
4.0 out of 5 stars,"It true. I still alive. And the Instant Pot bee pretty good and safe.PART ONEIn the beginin I not so sure. And this all be hauntin are family fur many yeers.Back in 1952 Grandma Wilkes buy something called the Immediate Pot that cost $4.99 on sale that promise to change her life. She kook from dawn to dusk fur a big family of 8 useless boys, 1 girl named Lulu and a husband named Zelmo who want hisdinner on the tabul when he say so. And while Grandma Wilkes and her sistur, Bready come from a line of good kooks, they also seem to inhabut the stoopid side of the family.On July 29 exactly 67 years ago, Zelmo and his brothers Elmo and Velmo, shoot a 14 pound posum and bring it home and want to eat it.   IMMEDIATELY !!!   For breakfast !!   Why for breakfust, yew say?  Well everbody with a brain the size of a walnut, no that yew kill posums at nite with Dawgs an men wearin there long underware.  Anyway, Zelmo, Elmo and Velmo bee so proud of thereselves for shootin the bigust posum in the county that they invite everbody home who they pass in town. Everbody want to see that big sucker 14 pound possum lookin up at them from a pool of gravy !!  Well Grandma Wilkes and her sister Bready haf to get up first thing before daylite and start to kook this 14 pound record settin behemoth immediately for everbody in town, plus those 8 useless boys. And so she drag out the presure kooker. (And she obbiously be under tremendous presure herself, to get this deelishus posum breakfast on the tabul.) So while Grandma Wilkes and Bready hurredly be preparin all the fixins for the big posum breakfast, Lulu get the job of aktually packin this ""verman"" (who also happen to be the name of my Oncle [Verman] on my daddys side) in the Immediate Pot. From the begining it seem to bee a problem. ""WHERE BEE ARE DEELISHUS POSUM BREAKFAST???"" cry Zelmo.“IT WON'T FIT MAMA !!  SCREAM LULU.  IT WON'T FIT !!   IT BE HOMOGENEOUS”“STUFF IT IN THERE, LULU !!  STUFF IT IN THERE !  CRY GRANDMA WILKES.   BREADY GRAB THE BROOM HANDLE !Well they finully get this monstrausagus in the pot an tighten it down with a crowbar.Well you no where this story bee going. And as everbody no, hoo look back on the sitiation, ther ain't no surprises hear.  Because there bee a splosion that was hurd all the way to the state line. Most everbody seem to be OK (altho most everbody also had a tendency to say Huh?? for the rest of their lives.)  Well except Grandma Wilkes who unfortunately hav her head blown to Chattanooga.So needles to say that $4.99 Immediate Pot did seem to change Grandma Wilkes life.(And fur the record, those 8 useless boys say the posum taste pretty good.)PART TOOIt took more than convincing fur me to by a pressure kooker. My mama, “Little Bready” (who not bee named fur relations on the other side of the family but after “Big Bready” who once bee an adult film star) tell me  “Yew need to relax moor, dotter, now that yur older.""  But to relax moor, yew got to tecknologocify.Now my mama worry about me and that bee OK.  When she marry my daddy, Boo, thay hav a pretty hard life together and she hafto slow down two when she develop calluses on her eyelids that neerly turn her blind.I say Mama, I not bee afrayed to teknologicify. Yew no I alreddy be as quick as I can be. An you no that I can kook everthing that swim, crawl, buzz, fly or scratch.I no dotter, say my mama, Little Bready.  When it come to food, you be a real kook.  But all I sayin is that you needtobee more aficient.But Mama, how  can I bee moor aficient if I don't got no head?At furst she conceit that I got a good point but in the end she persistify and persistify. I finully relegated and say OK. OK Mama, I in yur hands with this presure kooker  And I in the hands of the Lord.So my mama Little Bready and my ant by me an Instant Pot with all the possible ecksesorieslike spatoolas, wire trivials an screen door strainin gadgets.  But that Instant Pot sit in the box formonths and months.  And months.Finully my ant come to see me one morning and say,  Enuf bee enuf !!   Yew gonna get yurself out of this bed an kook us a meel with this concraption.  Yur mama and I spent are hard erned  money so you can be a womun of leeseure.  So get out of this bed rite now  !!Well I cant argue with that, I say to myself.   My ant probly bee the most sensicable womun I no.  (She neerly graduate from Jr high school.)So I pull my clothes on and then I rembemember that Uncle Will, Ant Chartroose and there groan son, Cuzin Gill (who live a life of intestinal affliction) bee coming for supper.  OK, I say to myself, that not going to bee a big ďeel.  I kook for them lots of times.So I plan my menu--pigs nuckles, collerd greens, grasshopper gizzards and a big sweet potato pie for dessert. And with lots of time, I stop over to the Piggy Wiggly to get a few things.  (But in the bag of my mind I cant stop  aworryin about that Instant Pot and weather it gonna blow us to kingdom come.)It be suppertime now, my gests arrive, I make small talk about my other ant, Ant Violet her little dotter LadyMary an there battle with that there toenail fungus that be sweeping all of Englund.  An then we talk quite a bit about Cuzin Gills sorry triboolations with his intestines.  An so by now everbody no that I bee stalling for time. So my mama an my ant fiscally drag me by the hare, out to the kitchen, to kook them pig nuckles.  An with them watchin ovur my shoulder, I put one of those babies in the pot an set it fur 23 minutes.  Well that aktually wernt two bad. But then it start to beep and gurgle.  And then it began to hissin an spittin an start to carrion like nobodys biznis.  It sound like when Cuzin Gill come back from Mexicali !!I get down on my hands and nees an scream,  O Heaven !!!  I headed for Chattanooga !! I wait a minute an nothin happun.  I open my eyes an wonder weather the next face I wood lay  eyes on wood be Grandma Wilkes.  But no, it bee my own mama, Little Bready.She say, Get up dotter,  get up!!  It soposed to make that racket.  Now get up, the bell dun ring an let's eat them nuckles.My mamas voice always sound so reesonable and kind.  So I bee reassured and open up that pot an there be a aroma of suckulence that few can conscribe.  All 3 of us be tickled pink!!  (Just like them pigs nuckles.)But as we carrion out the door this big platter of nuckles, we abruptly hurd it.  This big huge  Displosion---- BAAAAAAAAAAANNNNNNGGGGG !!!!!!  And fire that belch cleer across the room.  The windows break, the door come off its hinges and I land on my flying buttress !! Those nuckles fly off of that platter an role around that flore.  (But I not so woried, th flore bee kleen--see my vacyoom revuew.)BUT WHAT HAPPUN ???  We look back.  No it wernt the Instant Pot.  And it not bee an act of God.    Neer as we can tell, Cuzin Gill had ben eatin on a green appul and in a fit of intestinal rambunkshishness manage to ignite the pilot lite on the water heater.  An when we pick ourselves up oft the ground, we calm down pretty  good.  But it take Jack Daniels.So as I reflect on this hear day.  The Instant Pot dinner bee a complete success.  Everbodys heads still bee attached.  TIme wil tel how long we bee sayin Huh?? (And frum now on, Cuzin Gill gonna bee eatin in the barn.)  Thank you berry mutch.IYur Purfesional Thinker"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Okay. This is quite possibly the coolest, most versatile kitchen gadget I’ve ever owned. I love it so much, that I’ve purchased 2 more for friends and relatives. What does it do? I think the real question is “What can’t it do?” I truly believe you could replace every cooking appliance (including your oven and stove top) and do EVERYTHING in the Instant Pot. I purchased two sizes for my own use: the mini 3-quart (which is my almost-every-day work horse for 2 person dishes) and the 8-quart (which I bring out to handle my dinner party dishes). I have also purchased no less than 5 Instant Pot recipe books, and everything I’ve tried has been fabulous. In the realm of kitchen appliances, there is no better investment than the Instant Pot. My hat’s off to the inventors of this amazing appliance. Highly recommended!!!"
1.0 out of 5 stars,"I used this once and I loved it. Three days later I plugged it in to use again and it was dead. I tried a different power cord but it is the receptacle on the unit that's faulty. I'm returning it and I'm going to give it another shot. However, I will not update my review to be more positive until I see that the replacement I'll have to purchase actually works more than once.Update on December 24... I have contacted Instant Pot again. This appliance is 100% unreliable. The last 5 times I've used it, the instant pot will randomly power down mid cycle. I contacted Instant Pot in early December about this issue. Nearly a week later, I finally received a response asking if I had fully inserted the power cord and if I could get a video of the unit randomly powering down mid cycle. They suggested a water test for this. I responded that not only did I ensure the power cord was fully plugged in, I also tested the continuity of the power cord to rule that out. I expressed concern that they have a test that will cause the unit to randomly power down mid-cycle but I would not be spending hours of my life videoing the appliance to catch it shutting off at a random time. They responded that a video isn't necessary and they'll send me a new cooking unit but they are currently out of stock and they'll contact me when they have them in stock again. Two weeks later, I have heard nothing. I can order one from Instant Pot on Amazon and receive it in two days but they expect me to believe they have none in stock."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've only used the unit to cook 4 things:- Brown rice, chicken, mushrooms, carrots (all at once in the Instant Pot)- Peanut Chicken- Sweet Potatoes- Hard boiled eggsAll of them turned out great.  In my limited use of the product, I think the biggest reason to use the product is convenience.  You dirty many less pots and you can 'set and forget',  It's just really easy and convenient to use.For example, the brown rice, chicken dish I mentioned.  I literally put raw brown rice, chicken stock, mushrooms and carrots in the Instant Pot.  I put the lid on and set the timer for 26 minutes.The dish came out great.  The rice was perfectly cooked, the chicken was juicy and tender and the vegetables were cooked but not mushy.  Think about the steps, pots, and effort involved in typically preparing this meal.  Soaking the rice, cooking it separate from everything else.  Cooking the vegetables and chicken separately.  Again, all I did but throw everything in the pot and set the timer for 26 minutes.  One pot to clean afterwards!The other items came out out just as well.  The cooking time time is better than conventional cooking but not as much as you'd think because of the time it takes the pot to pressurize.As with most wildly popular products, this one is certainly slightly over hyped.  It's not a miracle appliance but I would certainly recommend it.  It's overpriced due to its popularity, but if you're going to actually use it regularly, it's worth it."
1.0 out of 5 stars,"I chose this item because I wasn’t certain how I would like an air fryer, I don’t have much room for another appliance,  and I thought this would be smaller to store.It’s very large, and awkward to store. Paradoxically, it’s such a tiny cooking area it felt like an easy bake oven. Two chicken thighs were too crowded.  It has a second rack, but if you use it there’s no way to flip the food midway during cooking as most of the recipes I found online suggested. The directions were laughingly minimal, it was simply cautionary warnings. No recipe there, no real instructions on how to use the appliance.I’ve tried to make chicken fingers, sweet potato fries and chicken thighs. None of it came out great, certainly nothing I’d try to repeat.It’s been years since I returned anything unless it was broken. This was such a disappointment that I am sending it back.If you want an air fryer, there have got to be better choices than this."
2.0 out of 5 stars,"What's all the fuss about?? If, as a number of people have said, there's 1) a steep learning curve, 2) it takes getting used to, 3) it's intimidating--then it's not a great product, or more likely, the instructions (such as they are) are poorly written. I found the instruction manual to be incomprehensible, and NO ONE in my house could replace and lock the lid (all educated adults). Clarity about the product was near nonexistent. It should not be difficult to write an understandable, straightforward manual. The IPot people failed to follow through. There's a golden book opportunity here for someone who knows how to teach, explain, simplify and otherwise make sense to people with new appliances. P.S. I put a new vacuum cleaner together yesterday with zero trouble. Whoever get this IP next at a discounted price: it's brand new and has never been used--but lots of luck--you'll need it.."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I admit it - I am a kitchen gadget freak. Still, I somehow avoided getting Instant Pot until recently.Maybe it was the peer pressure, or maybe it was just idle curiosity that finally kicked me over the edge. I have a traditional pressure cooker collecting dust in the basement, and truth be told, I've always been a little afraid of it. I have memories of mom cooking up dinner (circa 1965) in this hissing nightmare of a device. But still, I'd heard the Instant Pot was different.It is different. For one thing, it doesn't go on top of the stove. It plugs in, and it self-monitors to maintain a constant pressure, so it doesn't have to release excess steam -- no hissing while it cooks.The directions are well-written, and the unit is very well-built. If the recipe calls for it, you can brown meat in the stainless-steel insert, although I think this would be slower that just browning whatever meat you're using on the stove in a regular frypan. Clean-up is a bit fussy, since there is a silicone seal to remove and wash. The stainless steel cooking insert comes right out and can be hand washed or put in your dishwasher.The idea of reducing my cook times is appealing, but all is not as it first seems. The unit takes a bit of time to reach a boil (and then to build up steam pressure), and takes a bit more time to depressurize. It is all very elegant and non-scary. I conclude that it is worth the effort to use it if you want to cook meat or fowl quickly. Still, remember that this is a fancy steamer: it doesn't produce nice crunchy skin on chicken or beef.Also, if you are making a meat dish that includes vegetables, you'll need to cook in two stages. If you dump the meat in with the vegetables all at once, the vegetables will cook down to mush by the time the meat is done. So, that means to get everything right, you need to allow separate time to pressurize/depressurize for the meat stage, and then pressurize/depressurize again for the vegetables stage. And, all of this is hands-on (as opposed to a slow-cooker, which is pretty much hands-off).I made hard-boiled eggs that were quite good. But all-in-all, it was no faster than just boiling them on the stove.So, I'm thankful to the inventor of Instant Pot for getting me over my pressure-cooker paranoia. And I do use the devise when I need to cook/tenderize meat in a hurry. I'll use it, for sure, but not often enough to make room for it upstairs in my already over-crowded kitchen. It is in my basement, in the space created when I tossed out the old-fashioned pressure cooker that I never ever used."
2.0 out of 5 stars,"I LOVED this until the pressure cooker feature no longer worked.  I bought 2 of these (one for me and one for my daughter). BOTH of ours broke the same way. The silver button on top will no longer pop up to seal for the pressure cooker setting... my favorite setting!  So, I loved it, but it should last longer than 6 months!  UGH!"
1.0 out of 5 stars,"My first attempt to cook in my Instant Pot 1 week ago was a failure. I attempted to cook meatballs with grape jelly and chili sauce for a party. I followed directions exactly. using slow cook button.  When I opened the lid at the end of 4 hour cooking time, the inside of the pot and the meatballs were only slightly warm (not cooked), so I dumped the contents into my old crock pot to cook them.  Today I again attempted to use the Instant Pot as a slow cooker to cook baby Back Ribs with barbecue sauce, etc. I started the ribs at 11:00 am (slow cook button) and planned to have dinner for guests at 6:00 pm. When I opened the pot at 5:30 pm, SAME THING!! Ribs and sauce are barely warm, ribs UNCOOKED, so I will head to my local BBQ restaurant to p/u Ribs to serve with my sides!!! I just looked at my Amazon order for the Instant Pot & planned to return it but I see that my window to return it has closed on March 4 (even though I had not even attempted to use it by that date, so had no idea it was a dud. Of course I have no way to contact Amazon b/c I feel this item should be replaced due to being defective!"
2.0 out of 5 stars,"I’m still getting use to this pot. I tried making spaghetti in it and it burned. The pot was smart enough to tell me it was burning.. but not to adjust it’s self so it would not burn.. sigh.. and the recipe I followed for it..didn’t have enough sauce. The noodles were semi firm.. I like mine mushy..I tried making chicken in it. Just doing frozen thighs and potatoes for a quick dinner. The chicken didn’t cook in the time it said. So by the time I got it “cooked” I could have just fried it faster..Maybe it’s just me, but it shouldn’t be this hard to operate a fancy dancy pressure cooker/steamer..if you’re looking for something quick and simple.. this isn’t it. I bought it to make my life easier .. not harder."

5.0 out of 5 stars,So far I’m in love!  Chicken cordon blu was perfectly cooked.
4.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought the 6 qt. first from Costco because it was on sale.  It was way too big for two people and I could not take it with me in our RV.  I then bought this 3 quart.  I have used it four times for different things, bone in pork chops, brown and wild rice pilaf, pot roast, and boneless chicken breast with mushroom gravy.  All of these things turned out well although I am learning to tweak things as I go along.  Most recipes online are for the 6 qt. but you just cut the base liquid in half and the food in half for the 3 quart.  For example, if cooking a chicken on the trivet you would need 1/2 c liquid for the mini and a cup for the 6 quart.  You can still put in cups of liquid in the smaller one for other kinds of recipes, but you always need some liquid.  I don't believe it is quite as fast as you would think because there is the time to bring up to pressure and the various times letting the pressure release depending upon the recipe, but it works well and I always have enough leftovers for two people if I want. Also, with these cookers it doesn't matter if you are cooking 1 pork chop or 4 they still take the same time to cook so you don't have to keep guessing so much on what to do.  Clean up is easy.  I thought the sealing ring would be a drag to get in and out but it's not and the stainless steel cooking container is very easy to clean.  I will be using this in our RV as I don't have an oven and on previous trips I couldn't really cook too much and you don't want to be grilling all the time outside.  The sauté function works quite well, too.  I think one or two busy people would really enjoy having one of these. I have used a slow cooker in the past, but I feel tied down to them and actually don't find them as easy to use as cooking times can seem to vary so much.  Plus you don't sautés in them.  This is not the fad gadget I thought it would be, use a few times, grow tired of it and put it in a cupboard like my juicer and blender.  It's a real workhorse."
5.0 out of 5 stars,Kitchen must have. I use it all the time for a number of recipes. It's easy to use and clean.  I have it on my countertop because I use it all the time. I really need two.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Throw away your crock pots, rice cooker, yogurt machine, and pressure cooker. Those functions are all encompassed in the amazing Instant Pot. Last week, I seared a pound of hamburger in the Instant Por, left it there, added tomatoes, spices, and diced onions, and put it on low for two hours. When I came back, I had chili. Many people would now add beans, but I don't like beans. I use macaroni instead, and it doesn't freeze well, so I boil a quarter cup (dry) of macaroni when I have chili. I also boiled some ham bones, removed the bones and skimmed the brother, added peas, shaved carrots and spices. I pressure cooked that since it was for dinner. It took 15 minutes to render the peas into a sauce. I served it with steak knives since the chunks of ham are rather large. I pressure cooked some chicken breasts for 17 minutes since they started out frozen, and when they were done, I added a can of mushroom soup, a can of cream of celery soup, and a cup of white rice. Two minutes of pressure cooking made divine chicken and rice. I could go on and on, but the point is, what used to take multiple pans now takes one Instant Pot. If you do not have one, hurry. Get one. You need it. If you have one, say nice things to it; it deserves that kind of treatment."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"There is not one bad thing I can say about the instant pot duo plus 8 qt 9 in one I've been using it since the day I got it. It makes dinner prep SO easy. I don't know how I did without the instant pot this long. It makes dinner fast as a working mother I put everything in set the timer to cook as I am leaving work and when I get home it's done and clean up is easy. Remember when you are looking for a instant pot they have a 6qt and a 8qt but that is to the top of the pot which you would never do so if you are 1 or 2 people get the 6qt if you have more people or have parties get the 8qt even if you are 1 or 2 people and get the 8qt you still can just make enough for 1 or 2 but have the ability to cook for parties or the holidays. I've made a roast in 35 minutes to enchiladas, pasta sauce, oh and the egg feature makes the best hard boiled eggs I will never make them any other way, and peeling the is SO easy."
3.0 out of 5 stars,"The 8 quart size is too large for our family of 4. I take responsibility for buying an impractical size (darn you Black Friday!). It takes 15+ minutes to get up to steaming pressure/temp, so it is not quicker or more convenient for making dinner. Perhaps if you were making larger meals, like for a party or large family, there would be less air volume to pressurize and it would cook faster. I guess it makes for less dishes to clean up. We were hoping this was a ""fire and forget"" cooking device, like a really fast Crock Pot, that would make for less kitchen work in our busy evenings, but that hasn't been our experience so far. If you have been thinking of getting one, probably because of your social media friends over-posting about their Instant Pot meals, just remember, size matters."
2.0 out of 5 stars,"This unit is designed with a self sealing valve that is supposed to pop up when the pressure raises to the proper level.  It acts as a locking mechanism for the lid so you can't open the top when under pressure.  We battled with getting the valve to pop up every time we used it.  We kept the valve very clean and really did everything by the book to get the unit to seal up.  We would have to resort to tapping or banging on the the top or shaking the whole unit to get the mechanism to pop into place.  Last night after a frustrating 30 minutes of working to get the valve to seal, we ended up turning the unit off.  I had hoped to open the lid to investigate the problem - mistake!  It was still too hot.  We ended up with a huge mess.  See the photo of the mess we ended up with!  Yikes!  We cleaned it all up and emailed instant pot customer service today to see if they will assist with a solution.  I think the lid was defective to begin with as the seal should pop right up once under pressure.  I am really disappointed with the overall experience, but we will update here if we get a satisfactory level of customer service to fix the problem.  We keep trying because we have had some great meals (despite the effort) from this unit.  Just hope we can get it to work as designed..."
1.0 out of 5 stars,"Was very happy when I got my InstantPot. Unfortunately, it does not perform as the manufacturer says. The more I used it, the worse the item was. Have used pressure cooking for over 60 years. It over heats and get burn notice, got too much fluid left over. All following recipes from manufacturers. It is a lot slower than they claim. It takes a long time to get to right pressure and the recipes do tell u how to vent the pressure from the item. This can add 10 to 60 minutes before u can open it up. Thus it's no way you are getting food served"
2.0 out of 5 stars,"I’ve loved this Insta Pot, it really did make life easier, but it suddenly died, while it was in the midst of cooking. I bought it in October 2019 — it hasn’t even lasted a full year.  An appliance should last more than 8 months.  Customer service sucks:  You have to open a ticket, then they ask for pictures.  Then they come back and ask for more pictures and proof of purchase.  You send everything they ask for.... then they ignore you.  I’m disgusted that Amazon still allows this company to sell through them, EVEN THOGUH THEY DO NOT HONOR THE WARRANTY!  They told me that they can’t send out my replacement due to COVID, BUT YET THEY ARE SHIPPING THEM OUT IF YOU BUY ON THIS AMAZON SITE.  I INFORMED AMAZON, THEY OBVIOUSLY DON’T CARE."
1.0 out of 5 stars,"Really disappointed with this. The lid keeps scratching off the paint of the iron silo and its finding its way into the cooking pot and eventually into the food. Seems like every time I turn the lid, little pieces come out. Will be returning mine soon."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Ohhh man this thing is a game changer! My husband bought me the 8quart for an early Christmas gift, and it's AMAZING! I suck at remembering to take things out to defrost, so it's perfect for me. So far I made (in one pot) pork chili verde burritos, chicken and rice casserole, bbq shredded chicken sandwiches, and lastnight, a frozen solid pot roast! No joke, frozen pot roast turned into falling apart delicious goodness with potatos and carrots in 90 mins! It seriously took 4 mins to cook the potatos and carrots. Frozen chicken from costco in 15 mins. Ive  had almost no dishes to do all week long. It's friggin awesome. Can't say enough good stuff about it. I have a family of 3, but i bought the 8 quart, because i make leftovers for my husbands lunch the next day. And im so glad i got the bigger one. It's huge very large (about the size of a new wave oven) but worth the extra space you get inside. I could see myself being dissapointed  if I would have gone with the 6quart. Because you can only fill it up 2/3 of the way. All in all great buy, I'm giving away my crockpot. Makes food 10x better and faster. Also one thing to mention, is cabinets... when you push back the vent switch, there is alot of steam. I knew there was steam before I bought it ( thanks to schooling myself on YouTube videos before it arrived in the mail) but I was not aware of how much steam, and that it shoots out steam for a while. First time I used it, I pulled it away from my cabinets, but it still shot right up and got them wet with steam. Anyway, so I wanted to pre warn anybody, to make sure before you buy this that you have a place for it that is not directly over wood cabinetry. Anyway, good luck with your new purchase! Best gift I've ever gotten."
1.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought the Duo Plus this summer, use it everyday and absolutely love it so, I bought a second one on Thanksgiving!  The design has changed. It is not the one in the picture on Amazon even though it is the Duo Plus.  Okay, I can live with that. This pot does not have the Pressure Cook button down in the bottom right hand corner and the lid design has changed.  This one has the Sous Vid feature. I have no idea why they thought it would be a great idea to move the Pressure Cooker button where it was so easy to find (next to the Cancel and Saute buttons across the bottom) and replace it with the Sous Vid button I will never use.  The one they sent me smelled like plastic burning so after running the Sterilize feature three times and having a horrible time getting the steam release to not release steam nor get the smell to improve, I exchanged it. The one I received today does not smell like plastic burning!  Off to a good start. However, I'm still having the same problem with their new and improved lid.  I can't just set it and walk away. I have to wait until it comes up to pressure and mess with the new lever button until the dang thing seals and quits shooting steam out the steam release button. Five times (between the two pots), I have run the Sterilize feature to figure out this new and improved pot and five times, I've had to mess with the lid to get the steam to quit shooting out the top.  I'm calling Customer Service tomorrow. Amazon says Instant Pot is open on the weekends, but that is not accurate so, don't waste your time calling.  I hope they can send me the version I bought this summer. If not, there is a good chance I will return this unit even though it's 50% off in price.  If I'm doing something wrong with the lid, I'll update my review."
1.0 out of 5 stars,This product is a piece of crap. The instructions are incomplete and the codes that come up on the pot are not even mentioned. I have ruined two meals over this pot and have thrown it in the garbage! My advice to anyone thinking of buying this product...DON'T!! I am so frustrated over this poor excuse of a cooking product that I have to give it a minus one if I could.
1.0 out of 5 stars,"Perfect case of does many things ""just ok,"" but not great in one. Does NOT cook rice perfect like the other rice cookers on the market that only cooks rice. Too many steps to start the cooking process and too many steps to wait in order to actually open the lid. Not convenient at all. In conclusion, pressure cookers are not ideal for rice cooking. The rice was a harder than normal, and when cooked rice was cooled down, it was harder compared to rice that was cooked in the other rice cookers. Disappointed that I fell for all the marketing and hype. Not worth the price, even the Black Friday price. Will return and purchase a cooker that specializes in rice only."
1.0 out of 5 stars,"Luv part-I was initially reluctant to use instant pot and I barely used it. Once,i got the hang of it, i loved it so much that I recommended this to family and friends. I brought 2 of them as gifts too.Now comes the scary part.My instant pot still works, but the plug cord is loose and comes off with the slightest touch . It seems that the pot/cord is melting.I am not sure if I should still use it. And support centre doesn't respond. Attaching the pics.Current position- i think scare won. I keep worrying it might melt completely or catch fire. So stopped using it."
1.0 out of 5 stars,"The product itself was great when it worked. However, after about 4 months of weekly use, the sealing mechanism on the lid broke down. Without a good seal, food often ended up scorched or burnt (due to leaking moisture). As such, it became useless for actually cooking. I reached out Instapot support in an attempt to get help with the issue. They promptly sent me on a long and complicated journey that appeared deliberately designed to ensure they wouldn't actually have to do anything and that it would take many hours to actually get any help. Given that the product is (in my experience) unreliable and you'll have no help from the seller, it's hard to give it anything above a 1 star."
1.0 out of 5 stars,"I used this pot for the first time  to cook some beef ribs. I had trouble with the lid, it doesn’t go on very easy, and you have to be real careful to put it in it’s right position. I tried cooking it on stew, but that was too high and I never realized that it was using steam. I was lucky I did not get burnt. Then I switched it to Slow Cook  and I cooked it for six hours. These were only ate beef ribs, and the only ribs that were cooked with the ribs on the bottom, the ribs on the top or blood red and since they were beef they were not very tender or tasty, I’m sorry I put this crockpot, it’s not worth the money and it’s difficult to use. You never know what you’re going to get when you select an option until it’s too late."

5.0 out of 5 stars,Love this little gem!  Makes quick work of meal prep!  I’m planning on making my turkey breasts for Thanksgiving in this pot.  You can sear then cook all in one pot.  Cleanup is a breeze.  I bought the steam basket for my 3 quart size and it is the perfect add-on for steaming veggies.  I highly recommend this modern pressure cooker!
2.0 out of 5 stars,"I've tried a few recipes in the air fryer. The first was sweet potato fries. They came out fine, but it was far too much work. First it took two or three batches to cook the thick fries from 2 potatoes. Second, the base of the fryer basket is so far down compared to the diameter of the basket (constrained by the size of the Instant Pot stainless steel cooking pot) that it is very difficult to turn the fries over to finish cooking. I had to resort to some REALLY long chopsticks. None of my tongs, even my longest BBQ tongs, were really usable.The second recipe I tried was fried chicken. That came out GREAT! However, I could only cook 1 - 2 thighs at a time. One of the 6 thighs I cooked had to be cooked alone, which meant 6 thighs required 4 different cooking events. At 25+ minutes per batch, that was tiresome, and would make dinner for more than 2 at a time a pain.If you want an air fryer, I think you are better off buying a full-sized, dedicated air fryer vs. this smaller IP add-on."
1.0 out of 5 stars,"I probably got to use it 6 times at the most and it worked fine. The last thing I cooked was yogurt, it came out perfectly. I put it away and a week later, when I wanted to make a bean soup, to my surprise, it would not turn on. I checked the power cord, the valve, the ring... nothing wrong with any of that. The worst thing is that since I bought it from Amazon, they had closed the return window just a week before this broke. Now I have been in touch with Instapot support and I have been asked to send a variety of pictures of the equipment. This has been incredibly frustrating and disappointing to say the least. No new equipment should break mere weeks after purchase. I am stuck with this big useless pot that was not cheap to begin with. I hope I get helped."
1.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my second buy of this pressure cooker. I bought first one three years ago. I dropped lid, then got a crack. for the safety reason, I bought the new one last year. after couple months. the steam started to leak out. I contacted customer service. They send me a long to do list asking a very thorough questions. from recipe to water level, uploading 10 pictures and video. After a month, they send me a ring as the result. it didn't work out. NOW, they asked me to take the same pictures again. Such a hassle."
1.0 out of 5 stars,"I would give the product a second star, but the lack of support takes it away.  A little history.  My wife wanted to buy a rice cooker, I suggested an Instant pot instead as it would do more.  She was right.  We got a good deal($75) before the holidays and I put in a serious effort to get to know this thing.  Right off the bat, I got a lot of 'BURN' notices (sic, remember the show?).  Even when using recipes specific to this item?  BURN.  Usually 2-3 before actual pressure cooking.  BURN, open, scrape/stir/add liquid, repeat.  Tomato soup?  BURN!  Sauce, stew, vegetarian/chicken/beef chili, pulled chicken, chicken stock?  BURN!  It takes a lot of the speed out of the thing, especially if you're not watching for the BURN, come back expecting a finished meal only to be disappointed.  I researched, changed how I stacked things in the pot.  Stopped sauteing in it completely.  BURN BURN BURN.  So, over a week ago I finally after waiting too long for an exchange and possibly return,  contacted Instant Pot's support.  I got an open support ticket with an email.....that's it.  Eight days and not a peep.  They mention a holiday backlog?  The holidays that ended weeks ago?  I even tried replying to my own support ticket to see if it kicked the tires?  Nope.  Either they're completely inundated with problems or incapable of support OR maybe I didn't reach the level of deserving support?  Any way you look at it, if you're thinking of buying this should concern you.  I am ashamed that I fell for the whole 'cult' thing that seems to drive this product, I thought I was immune to and wary of fanboyism.  To be fair, all but one batch of rice didn't 'BURN' nor did the one time one made chicken soup, so it's not all failure.  This is supposed to be a time saver and my experience proves it's anything but.  Even as a rice cooker, I tested it side by side with my stovetop method and starting from cold, the Instant Pot is almost a minute slower.  Buyer beware of the product and the fanboys that guard it like it's their child.  BURN!"
3.0 out of 5 stars,"I made two dishes with this and both turned out very well.  The reason i gave them 3 stars is because of their customer support.  I melted the lid on my stove top and needed a replacement. When i went to website and chose lids the only lids that came up were clear ones for steaming. I then called and they just said go to website, could not order over the phone etc. Finally got him to direct me where to look on website for the pressure lid and they were all sold out. Could not give any estimate of when they might be in stock.  The thing i disliked was he made no attempt to provide this information."
1.0 out of 5 stars,"Not my thing.  Takes as long or longer to make things when you add the time in for pressurizing and release.  Very tempermental, it may or may not pressurize depending upon too many things.  Release valve broke the second time I used it.  Steam was pouring out into my cabinets. Don’t want something I have to baby and baby sit.  This is going back. Even at half price, it’s not worth it for me."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love my 3qt Instant Pot Duo! It's the best investment I've made in a long time! There is a pretty steep learning curve if your someone who doesn't like to cook. I love to cook and learn new things so it worked out for me. But you have to do things differently with the instant pot. However, once you get a few recipes down it's so easy to use! I use mine almost every day!Note about the ""Instant"" part of the Instant Pot. It's not really as ""instant"" as some might think. Most Instant Pot recipe cook times are not accounting for prep, pressurization, and cool down or de-pressurization. Something that takes 20mins to cook in the Instant Pot really takes like 30-45mins because it has to get up to pressure first before it starts the cook timer. Then you either do a quick release or a natural release of the pressure which can add anywhere from 5-40mins depending on what your cooking. So this means some things take just as long to cook as if they were on the stove top or in the oven. However, there are things that cook a lot faster than they would normal regardless of the extra time. For example, baked (or rather steamed) potatoes only take about 20 mins including pressurization, cook time, and quick release in the instant pot instead of an hour in the oven. Plus it doesn't heat up the whole house like an oven and for me, who lives in Arizona, not heating up my house any more than I have to in the Summer is a blessing. :D So for that reason alone, it's super worth it!I recommend watching some how-to videos online and getting a feel for how to use the product before purchasing."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I always avoided these because of the weird cult following and assumed all these reviews were fake. I tried other brands and also have a cosori unit, but honesty the extra features and stuff on this is so great I use it as my main pressure cooker. Ive used mine every day since purchase, sometimes twice, and it still works great. It even shuts itself off and notifies you if the food starts to burn due to too little water being added, my food was dry but hadn't yet burned so it saved my meal from being ruined."

1.0 out of 5 stars,I purchased the Instant Pot five months ago for my wife.  We have ruined numerous meals over that time period.  We finally discovered it never works in LOW settings. I am very upset but now I know it was not my wife's fault.  How can I get a replacement Instant Pot?
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love it! Wholesome food has just been turned into fast food in our house!!! My husband and I have jobs that sometimes require long hours without much notice. So getting home at 7pm when you've started at 7am can leave you exhausted. And when your hungry your first though is ""uuuugh I don't want to have to cook and WAIT an hour or 2 for it to get done! No no!I've seen and heard such amazing reviews I finally decided to try it.I bought the 6qt and loved it so much that 2 weeks later I also bought the 8qt. I use the 6qt for my side dishes and the 8qt to cook my main meats!The lid and inner pot go right in to the dishwasher (after you pull apart the sealing ring on the lid so it can be washed and sanitized properly) so next to no clean up. You can buy your meats in bulk. Just cut your portions, season then freeze! This pressure cooker will even cook from frozen!Collard greens in 10 minutes. Macaroni and cheese from scratch 10 mins. Whole, free range pasture raised young chicken 30 mins and sooooo juicy! Cheesecake 20 mins! Whole rack of pork ribs 45 mins and literally falling off the bone. Thick porkchops in a cream of mushroom sauce made from scratch 15 mins!I encourage you all to try this out and you'll wonder how you went without. We very rarely if ever eat fast food or go to a restaurant now. In the time it takes my husband to jump in the car drive down to get fast food, order, pay and head home whatever I threw in the Instant Pot has about 5 or 10 more mins until done. Same thing goes with a restaurant. In the amount of time it takes for my food to come out after you go in, wait to be seated, and finally order.......15 more mins at home and I'll have the same thing but I know the ingredients I used to make it. NON GMO, ORGANIC, FAIR TRADE and not irradiated with a microwave to reheat!I love both of my Instant Pots. I come from a family of home cooked meals, back when moms and dads worked full time 40+ hrs a week, did homework with the 4 of us kids when they got home and then mom would cook a meal (mostly from scratch with appropriate ratios of veggies to meats to starchy foods) while dad washed behind her as she cooked! I'll always prefer the taste of healthy home cooked meals over processed any day.  But time and energy was fading and it became a challenge to be the same superwoman my mom was (minus the 4 kids)!!! And now I can fit nutritious home cooked meals for my husband and I into our 40-60hr work week!It's two fold! The more healthy home cooked meals you eat the more energy you have and the better you sleep. Until you do it you have no idea what you're missing out on! Go on give it a go! If you know your way around a kitchen......you'll love all of the things you can do with this!  And just like cell phones and submitting mobile reviews on Amazon you'll wonder how you ever got along without it :-)THANK YOU AMAZON AND INSTANT POT!!!!"
2.0 out of 5 stars,"I returned this without using it for a couple of reasons. The biggest is that it just did not have a lot of cooking space. While this is for a 6-qt Instant Pot, you have to use a plastic basket that fits inside your metal pot, and there's hardly any space. Also, while I don't know much about other Instant Pots, I'm worried about the safety of this. It comes with a pad to set it down on when you take the lid off, but that has me concerned about it being something someone may accidentally touch and get burned. I got this because I thought it would be a nice accessory with my IP and take up less space than getting a new gadget, but it's pretty big along with its accessories."
3.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm an Instant Pot newbie - thought I'd give it a try to see if I could save some time and have a meal ready even though I'd forgotten to take something out of the freezer. I have to say - I find it a bit intimidating and I was really disappointed by the recipes that were included in the instruction manual. They were really nothing that either I, or anyone in my family would eat. So where to go from here - I like the idea of a single pot and reduced cooking time. I headed to youtube for videos of people getting started and some recipes from pinterest. It would be really useful for the manufacturer to do video ""tutorials"" just to get you started. Having tried a couple of basic chicken recipes it works quite well. Essentially, I've traded the time I'd save in cooking with time scouring the internet for tips, tricks and ideas.  It will take me a while to learn how to use it properly, so whether or not I stick with the learning curve remains to be seen. I have several friends who are fans, so I'll probably get with them for tips. Hope that helps other people with a realistic view."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"I am writing this because I just want to advise at least one person of this:  when people say that it will cook something such as say an ear of corn in 2 mins (it will) they do not include the fact that it can take approximately 8.5 minutes to get up to pressure first and then the clock starts.  So for me so far, I am not impressed as much as people I have talked to about this appliance have said I would.  I do feel that it is useful, and so far it works great.  It is just not as awesome as you read about.  I made a chili that the prep time said was 10 minutes and the cook time was 20 mins.  In reality, it took about an hour and a half from start to finish.  And it could have just been made in a conventional pot just as easily.  So just be aware that if a recipe states that it cooks in 5 mins that is after the 8-10 mins for it to get up to pressure.  Also the Instant Pot Duo Nova has a very easy pressure valve button that you are not going to scald yourself on or forget to reset it (it resets automatically.)"
1.0 out of 5 stars,We loved our instantpot until it stopped working and showed error code C6H with beeping sound.  This error is on multiple websites.This is a pressure sensor error.  Instantpot support was contacted with photo of receipt and back of instant pot.  Instant pot support responded saying the error could be that something was spilled on the inside.  Nothing had been spilled.  They instructed to remove the bottom (need star shaped tool that most people do not have).  They also asked for 4 other photos.  I think they want to make it difficult for the customer to have replaced.  I recommend you do not buy unless you are okay with it working for only about a year.
1.0 out of 5 stars,"Used the fryer with basket only a handful of times in 2 months, and the coating inside the basket is peeling off. I’m so disappointed."
5.0 out of 5 stars,I’ve only used it a couple times but I already love it! Glad I don’t have to have another appliance in my tiny kitchen!
1.0 out of 5 stars,"So highly pissed about this purchase. I stupidly decided to slow cook some sauce for my first meal and that turned out how it usually does, freaking fantastic. It wasn't until I returned from a business trip that I tried to pressure cook something just to find out the release handle is freaking broken. Does not vent the pressure, so unless I want to risk a natural release with a defective valve knob I am screwed out of a pressure cooker. Of course this was right after the 30 day return policy. I will have to go through their warranty program which is just a huge PITA for a new purchase. Wish I didn't throw away my old Nesco 3in1 pressure cooker than served me well for 8 years without issue. Sad."
1.0 out of 5 stars,I hated it. I remember my Mom cooking in the old pressure cooker with the weight and any meat she cooked in it would just melt in your mouth it was so tender. This thing might cook fast but the texture of the meat is stringy and awful. My family would not eat it. I tried three different times and followed the recipe exactly but ended up throwing all three roasts away. HUGH waste of money!!
5.0 out of 5 stars,"OMG! A most have if you love your instant pot this is an amazing addition to the kitchen! I’ve made nuggets for the kids, fries, wings & baked. This is a die for item. I wanted for months an air fry but bought my instant pot. When this came out I was beyond happy I never bought an air fryer. Only because this does WAY more than just frying! It’s an all in one! I don’t need to worry about my oven taking forever to pre-heat small items which makes life a little more convenient especially having little hungry humans at home!"
4.0 out of 5 stars,"So I remember the old days... my mom cooking with an aluminum pressure cooker on the stove and us kids freaking out when the seal-cap started “whistling” (more like a scream the neighbors could hear!) I could also tell my mom was literally afraid the pot was going to explode...Yay for technology! If you like your beef, chicken or pork cooked tender FAST then the instant pot is for you. I finally don’t mind meal-prepping because it doesn’t take a whole day! (I still mind it a little, who doesn’t?) That said it’s not perfect. And it’s not a crock pot or Dutch oven replacement. Here’s why:  once the instant pot reaches it’s sealed cooking temperature you can not remove the lid until it has safely depressurized. So while it cooks your meat in a quarter of the time, you can’t open the thing half way through to throw in carrots and potatoes. Say you are doing a large roast -your carrots and potatoes will likely come out much mushier than you would like. Same thing for stews, curries etc. Not that you can’t make those in the instant pot, but you might end up cooking the veggies separately. Also, this will not replace your rice cooker. I’ve tried it with the instructions, but it doesn’t cook the rice faster or better.. a $20 rice cooker with on on/off switch seems to figure that out better. That said there is a wealth of instant pot recipes and info online now, I recommend looking at those to get an idea of how you would use the instant pot to cook at home. Cleaning is pretty simple but food particles stick to the pot a little more than I expected. I always have to let it soak for a while. Also, if you don’t remove the clear rubber seal and clean it separately the smells of what you cooked will linger on. In conclusion I think that yes, it’s worth it to have something that takes your meat from frozen to fall off the bone tender in under an hour.  I’m looking forward to discovering new ways to use my Instant Pot."
3.0 out of 5 stars,"Used for the first time the other day to slow cook a roast, potatoes, and carrots. The potatoes did not cook at all and the carrots were only half cooked. The roast ended up overdone. Not impressed so far..."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Highly recommend this machine!  I have used it to cook everything from cheesecake, hard boiled eggs, mashed potatoes, mac and cheese and ribs and it all turned out perfectly. I did purchase a second insert.  Try cooking mashed potatoes, cheesecake and ribs with one liner all on the same night and you would purchase a second one too!  My must have extras:  A second stainless steel liner, stainless steel strainer basket, spring form pan and freezer food containers."
1.0 out of 5 stars,"The retaining ring inside the shaft where the float valve moves up and down obstruct the raise of the float valve, thus prevent the pressure from building up. The obstruction happened when you tilt the cooker over in certain direction, therefore, the pressure cooker works only half of the time at random. Did not use cooker much (only used it 6 times) since the pressure was building up some of the time but not always. I finally decided giving it a closer look yesterday and that is when I realized this manufacture defect, the retaining ring is supposed to prevent the float valve from popping out of the shaft after the pressure build up, but in my case, it stops the float valve from sealing the pressure. Very disappointed."
3.0 out of 5 stars,"I have had the original Philips XL Air Fryer, and because I absolutely love love love my instant pot, and because the Philips takes up sooooo much counter space, I thought I'd try this lid for my vacation home.So, I did a test - cook two packages of party wings from Costco to a crisp.In the Philips XL, it took exactly 35 minutes on high, shaking the basket every ten minutes. The wings were evenly browned and crunchy.In the Instant Pot, with the Air Fryer lid, it took 75 minutes, and the wings didn't get to the same level of crispiness.That doesn't work for me."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This isn't Grandma's stovetop pressure cooker!!  My goodness!I first used it on chicken breast and broccoli.  Yep. I was talking to my sister on the phone about my new instant pot, hoping to glean tips from her, and I had the chicken cooking. Suddenly it began hissing and spitting and steaming. I literally jumped back and asked, ""Oh my gosh! What's happening?""  She said, ""I don't know!  What is happening?""  So I described the evil emitting from the top of the pot. She said, ""You didn't do the water test, did you?"" I did NOT do the water test.  I told her it smelled like plastic was burning, and she assured me that was normal, too.  It was all normal. It's all the magic of the instant pot!I also thought it was broke because the pressure release valve would not release pressure unless I pulled the lever and held on to the switch. I learned you have to PUSH the button DOWN for a continuous hands-free release!  You can pull the lever to the side to release a little or you can push DOWN on the top of it to allow it to release it all at once!  AND you can pull the lever while it is autoreleasing, and it will stop releasing.The cool thing about my particular model, besides having holes in the handles to set the lid, is it automatically sets it to pressure, so you don't have to push anything on the top of the lid before starting it. Also, the steam releases from a different spot than on the same lever you pull to release. I would definitely get scorched with the other models!So, I got the 8 quart, and I don't regret it, even with just hubby and I. We drink bone broth like crazy, and this pot makes five quarts.  I freeze some and drink some. Also, Thanksgiving is just a block away, and this is going to come in handy!  I wonder if I can jam a turkey in this bad boy?So what do I think of this instant pot?  If you have read this far, you're either totally nuts, or you really want an instant pot.  I have no regrets!  I like this more than the microwave.Oh!  And my first meal turned out delicious!One thing to keep in mind if this is your first: an instant pot isn't REALLY instant. It takes a while to built the pressure, takes time to cook the food, then takes time to release the pressure, if done naturally (without you releasing it...but you can do that too). However, like my sister said, ""It may not be THAT instant, but you don't have to babysit it"".  She's right again! You can set it and not worry about whether it's going to boil over or boil dry. You can throw the food in, set it and spend time with your family. AND as far as bone broth goes, you don't have to cook it for 24 hours!  Four hours, TOPS, and it's not really that long.  Some cook it for an hour.So, if you are still reading this, well, bless your heart! You may need a few sessions of therapy, or you really want this pot!  In either case, I think this is the only time I've ever encouraged people to buy the pot!  Go for it!  You know you want it!  Just say, ""No problem! Ring me up!"" You won't regret buying the Instant Pot!I am not affiliated with the sellers of Instant Pot or Instant Pot company or Amazon. I'm not making ANY money off this review. I just love the Instant Pot that much!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've always wondered if those air fryers you see on the television infomercials really worked the way they say they do.  But even if they did I was hesitant to add yet another appliance to my growing collection.  When I saw the Instant Pot Air Fryer Lid in stores I thought 'Wow, that's an interesting idea', but I also thought 'Way too expensive'.  And it worried me that of all the products in WS it was never demonstrated.  But when i saw a sale that brought the price down to what I considered an acceptable level I thought I'd give it a try.  I worried about capacity since that was one of the issues some reviewers brought up, and yes, if you're trying to fry a five pound bag of French fries you're going to have to do it in multiple batches.  But you would have the same issue with a deep fryer.  As an engineer I notice how a product is fabricated and how it performs compared to other options.  The Instant Pot Air Fryer Lid is well constructed.  It feels solid and I haven't noticed any issues - so far.  One criticism I have is the poor instructions that come with it.  Yes, it's simple to use once you understand it but I think Instant Pot is missing a bet by the quality (or lack thereof) of their instructions.The first thing you're warned about is to use the steel insert rather than the non-stick ceramic insert.  At least they made that abundantly clear.  The next step was to set the temperature and time - without putting any food inside.  I was amazed at how quickly it got to temperature, I was expecting it to be like our small convention oven and take multiple minutes.  Nope.  It was telling me it was at temperature much faster.  Once at temperature putting the insert that holds the food to be fried can be somewhat complicated, but nothing too difficult.  Put the top back on and let things go.Usually you'll get a beep to tell you to flip the food about two thirds of the way done.  With frozen French fries the only thing I've noticed being any possible issue if you ignore that is some of the fries may have a bit of a soft texture if they've been in close contact with other fries during the frying process.I haven't tried all the different settings or a lot of different foods and the reason for that comes back to the poor instructions.  Why don't they provide a chart or table with a list of different products that they've determined the best cooking times for?  It's puzzling.  Luckily, I've found more and more frozen foods that come with instructions for air frying.  That surprised me.  So I'm making my own table as I try different things.Overall, a big fan of the Instant Pot Air Fryer Lid; not a fan of the instructions or lack of recipes."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"The Instant Pot is amazing. I was concerned that the 3 quart would be too small for 2, but it is just perfect. It makes for easy meal preparation for two and no leftovers to store and find in the refrigerator a week later. I have been using it twice a day since it arrived. Easy to use and keep clean. I do recommend buying insert pans for easy stacking or a steamer basket. I wish that I had purchased one a year ago! I've given away my heavy crock pot and pressure cooker, rice cooker and yogurt maker! Like I said, the Instant Pot is amazing!"
2.0 out of 5 stars,"Really liked this product, was slightly intimidated but everything I cooked came out very good. Like just having one pot to cook everything from sauteing to Browning meat.  But it broke after 2 months of use. Probably used it about 8 or 9 times. Got an error code with flashing lights. I submitted a ticket with product support so I'll see how they respond. Right now I can't recommend this product because it broke with less than 10 uses. I will change my review if it gets replaced and doesn't break agsin"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Over the years, I have purchased hundreds of items from Amazon, and for the most part, got what I expected.  I never reviewed any of them.  But from the moment I received my Instant Pot, I felt that I had purchased something that not only exceeded my expectations, but will make my life easier (and more delicious)!I am a holistic nutritionist and a follower of a lower carb/paleo/primal lifestyle (and yes, it is not only a food regimen, but a lifestyle).  Many of the meals I prepare require advance planning and preparation, and I am OK with that, realizing that it is an investment in my family's health and wellbeing.  I was looking for something that would support my food choices and perhaps make it a little less time-consuming.  I have used a crockpot extensively over the past years and while I appreciate the ease of use and the ability to put a meal on the table soon after I got home in the evening, there is that ""everything tastes the same"" factor I was running into with my family.So I began thinking about ways to cook my meals faster and realized that a pressure cooker may be the answer.  But, I am scared of pressure cookers.  Even though my head tells me that people have been using them for many years with no problems, my heart said there was a strong chance I could blow up the entire kitchen, myself included.  I had no idea there were electric, programmable pressure cookers out there that would virtually eliminate that worry until I began researching them, first on Amazon, and then on other websites.  I eventually purchased the Instant Pot over the others because of the stainless steel insert (no aluminum), the size of the pot (I wanted a larger capacity), and the ease of use.The day it arrived, I plugged it in and began reading the manual.  The manual was very helpful, even included a suggested trial run to familiarize one with the basics.  My first meal was potato soup (I know potatoes are not low carb or paleo, but once in a while you gotta have potato soup).  I was amazed at how easy and delicious it was to make this soup that would normally take a couple of hours.  I just coarsely chopped the vegetables, threw those in the pot, added the seasonings and the liquid, started the pressure cooker option, and in 20 minutes all I had to do was use my immersion blender to puree the soup, add some cheese, stir and it was ready to eat.  AND the soup was every bit as good as my slower version that keeps me tied to the kitchen to stir and monitor until it's done.  That is the hidden beauty of this appliance, that while it's cooking your food, you are free to do other things such as harass your kids to get their homework done.  No more watching over a pot!My second recipe was lemon pepper chicken wings.  There is a searing option, so first I browned the wings in a bit of butter, then added lemon pepper, salt, and 2 more tablespoons of butter.  Put on the lid, set the pressure cooker for 25 minutes, and out came the most delicious, fall-of-the-bone wings just loaded with flavor.  The family went wild!I also made mushroom gravy (no flour) pork chops in 30 minutes in the pressure cooker - the gravy was so good my son ate in on top of some gluten free noodles the next day for lunch - and a breakfast meat loaf in the slow cooker, also a winner.I am also using this to reheat food since we don't use the microwave anymore and I'm finding that it seems easier and makes less of a mess than going stovetop.That's a pretty long review for a first-timer but I am so enthusiastic about this product that I just had to share."
1.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought the Instant Pot DUO Plus 3 Qt 9-in-1 Multi-Use in July, 2018.  I enjoyed this product. It has always worked exactly as described and designed. Until now, a mere 7 months later. Yesterday I sauteed then pressure cooked some spaghetti sauce with meat as I've done many times before. Set on pressure cook, high, for 13 minutes. All systems go. I watched the screen say ""ON"", then 13, then it continued counting down. I looked up again, I saw the number ""8"", looked up again about 3 minutes later, and it read ""9""!!! Okay, realizing there is a problem, but I let it continue, and it did, and beeped, as usual, when it was finished. Then the screen went dark after a few minutes, as usual. The pressure was down, so I could have opened it, but instead I left it on the counter untouched, with the food inside while I continued to read. Now This is the wild part---I left it plugged in, thinking that all was well, it had turned itself off...BUT NO...without me or anyone else (I was home alone) touching it, it came back on, lit up, and the screen all of a sudden said ""26""! On two other occasions, in the three days prior, I also noticed that several times during the timer countdown that the number suddenly increased from say, a ""8"" to a ""9"" several minutes later. My suspicions have come true.  So I have unplugged it, obviously, and I believe I cannot ""trust"" it to be accurate or safe. So I cannot use it. At all. It is dead. And I am not happy, seven months later."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"I already own the older 6 qt Duo, I bought from Walmart over a year ago. I bought this because I thought it would be nice to have something smaller, since it is now two of us and the bigger one felt like overkill.  When in doubt go for the  6 qt because it gives you much more options, especially if you want to ""bake"" desserts in it. The smaller instant pot takes longer to heat up than my trusty older one and the rack doesn't have little handle wings to pull items out with. I highly recommend going with the larger sizes. I use this appliance at least 4 times a week, no exaggeration."
2.0 out of 5 stars,"First, while the pot itself is already small, the soup can not be filled to more than half full, or turning the valve form seal to vent would cause the liquid to spill out through the vent hole and get all over the lid. Second, after 10 months, it EXPLODED! And scared the hell out of me and my roommate. I have been properly using it as a pressure cooker before that. The lid popped out with a loud exploding sound, and the soup came out and flooded everywhere. Then there was this dent that showed on the body of the pot (shown in picture). I am now too scared to use the pressure cooking function and can only use it as a slow cooker."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"If you're wondering if the hype about instant pots is legit, I'm here to tell you that it IS and you need one. It's really helped me since I frequently forget to thaw meat the night before. Also, being able to throw everything in and have a fantastic white chicken chili come out in less than an hour, is just ideal.To be clear, when you look online, you see stuff about how things cook in ten minutes or twenty-- And, while this is true, that doesn't account for the amount of time it takes to come up to pressure. Last night, I seared a roast (using the saute feature), then put the other things in, and sealed it. It took 10-15 minutes to come up to pressure, in addition to the cook time, so with each meal you have to plan accordingly. It can take more or less time depending on what you're cooking. (For rice it's pretty fast, but when i put frozen chicken in it took like 20 minutes to get up to pressure.)This came with a little recipe booklet, as well as a cheat sheet of reference times for cooking, which is hugely helpful, since I don't always want to google for every single thing I cook.It works as a slow cooker, pressure cooker, has a saute function, can cook rice, make yogurt, steam eggs, and basically anything else you want. It's been helpful for me because I've been able to branch out into different meats that I might not normally have the time or know-how to cook properly.If you're stressed about safety, this is reassuring because the directions are very clear, and it locks in. I was really freaked the first time I used it, and knew nothing about pressure cookers or instant pots at all the first day.  So far we have had no incidents, just be aware that you should NOT use your hand to flip the switch over to release the pressure. Risk of steam burn is huge. I use the handle of a wooden spoon, since I don't like living dangerously.Anyways, the amount of cupboard space this takes up is worth it, and if we had a bigger kitchen I would leave it out all the time on the counter. I love it THAT much.For our family of three, the 6qt capacity is perfect. If you have more than four people in your family though, I don't know if it would be sufficient.Either way, you should buy one of these."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Instant Pot Duo Nova Pressure Cooker 7 in 1, 10 Qt is an excellent and easy to use Instant Pot. I appreciate the simplicity of use and ease of cleaning. I bought the 10 Qt size to cook large meat items, like a whole @6 lb chicken or an 8 to 10 lb whole turkey. I do not always want to butcher into smaller pieces a whole chicken or turkey--I like to stew the carcass in water with vegetables to render my own chicken or turkey stock for soups, gravies, etc. I used the IP to cook a 5.75 lb roasting chicken. I added 3 cups of liquid to the inner pot and used 6 minutes per pound at normal pressure with 10 minutes of natural pressure release. So for a 5.75-pound chicken, take 5.75 lb x 6 minutes/lb, your lbs cancel out and do the multiplication and you are left with 34.5 minutes. I input 34 minutes. Perfect chicken. I painted Kitchen Bouquet on the skin after and broiled it to brown--even that step did not dry out the chicken, but I would skip it next time because it is a waste of electricity and gets my kitchen too hot. The inner pot is huge so it can handle larger cuts of meat plus vegetables. The line of Instant Pot products are time and energy savers and are easy to clean and maintain. The Duo Nova is a no-brainer to use with the addition of the Smart lid: The new easy seal lid gives you one less thing to worry about because it automatically seals your Instant Pot. Steam release is also a breeze with the fast, safe push of the quick-release button. And it even comes with a bonus sealing ring. Great product. I give the Instant Pot Duo Nova Pressure Cooker 7 in 1, 10 Qt a rating of 5 out of 5."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This thing has become a workhorse in my small kitchen. It has improved my cooking skills and I’m cranking out some delicious recipes, wowing my family and friends.I make three to four dozen pickled eggs and usually 1-2 dz for deviled eggs every month. This makes that process easy and flawless.I made BBQ Country boneless pork ribs last night. Dry rub seasoned them and stacked them on end in a cup of apple cider vinegar with a teaspoon of liquid smoke. 35 min/natural release. Then I put them in a foil lined baking dish and covered them with some chopped onions and smothered them in BBQ sauce. Then, Into the broiler for 15 min. to carmelize the onions and  sauce and add some crispy ness  Oh.  My.  God. You could open up a pit bbq stand and no one would know the difference. 😉😂Beef Stroganoff or any soup or meat tastes like it’s been simmering all day.It’s easy to clean, easy to use. I bought the extra set of gaskets but I have not needed them yet. I also bought the glass lid and silicone cover lid. They work great for storing leftovers in the fridge, sautéing and just lifting it out, covering it and taking it to a potluck. Someone needs to come up with an insulated sleeve u could drop it down into and carry it, hint, hint... you sewing ladies out there could make a fancy quilted one, I’m sure.I love this thing!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love my Instant Pot!  After watching several infomercials about electric pressure cookers, I did some research.  This Instant Pot had the best reviews and overall customer satisfaction ratings as well as being quite a bit less expensive than the one I saw on TV!Last night after watching a YouTube video on how to cook a beef roast in the Instant Pot and after reading the instruction manual, I tried that bad boy out.  Below is the recipe I followed with parts I made up myself:Ingredients:1 - 2.5 pound chuck roast4 - red potatoesWeber Chicago Steak SeasoningBeef Bullion CubesGarlic SaltMinced OnionsAbout a tablespoon of cooking oilI took the roast straight out of the freezer and put it on defrost in the microwave just long enough to get it to separate from the wrapper (about 4 minutes).I put the Instant Pot on Saute and let it get up to temperature.  When it read HOT on the display, I put in just enough oil to cover the bottom of the pot lightly (about a good tablespoon.)Next, I took the frozen roast and put it in the pot and browned it on all sides and ends.  (This took less than five minutes, total.)After the roast was brown, I added two cups of water and 3 beef bullion cubes, a dash of garlic powder, a good coating of the Weber Chicago Steak seasoning and about four tablespoons of minced onions I got at the dollar store.  I put on the lid and hit the Meat / Stew button and per the YouTube video I watched on how to cook the roast, I moved the time up to 41 minutes, made sure the release valve was set to pressure and walked away.When I heard the timer go off I manually released the steam.  You can do this by gently bumping the release valve so it doesn't all come out at once or just move the release valve to ""release"" and watch it.  Since this was the first time in my life I'd ever used a pressure cooker, I just kept gently bumping the valve to release pressure until the ball thing next to it dropped and I knew it was safe to open the lid.The result was the best roast I've ever had in my life in about a fourth of the time it would have taken me to cook it in the oven.  The meat was tender and juicy but not mushy.  The potatoes had the flavor of the meat all through them and the broth left from cooking I could've used to make gravy, which I didn't because my guys were hungry.  So I saved the broth to use in a stew.  In less than one hour I had a meal that would've taken me three or four hours to cook to the same degree of tenderness in my oven.  The whole kitchen wasn't heated up, and I was left with a single pot to clean.If a novice like me can use this bad boy and have such outstanding results, anybody, and I mean anybody can do it!  And, if you work all day and would rather spend your evenings hanging out with your family than hanging out in a kitchen, do yourself a favor and get this machine!  I'm so glad I did.  We have GOOD, HEALTHY food to eat that tastes wonderful and save both time and money.  I love my Instant Pot!"
1.0 out of 5 stars,"Ehhh. I purchased this model because the description said it was for beginners even though it was more expensive than other models. It was easy to set up and put together. Great directions for that.  However they literally only tell you how to boil water. That’s it. No recipes.  Just a piece of paper that tells you cooking times.  It does not tell you how much water to add, how to actually start the machine beyond boiling water. Nada. Nothing else. I would get the less expensive model. It comes with a basic cook book according to family &  friends.  I ended up waiting for a slow cooker lid so I could at least use as a slow cooker without having to take all the pieces of the pressure cooking lid apart to clean and purchasing a cookbook.  Literally did not use it for a week.  Even still I tried to make oatmeal from a instant pot recipe book I purchased.  Since there are NO INSTRUCTIONS beyond set up and boiling water, instead of cooking for 3 minutes; I set the delayed start for 3 hours. Delay/Start on the same button when there are NO INSTRUCTIONS beyond boiling 3 cups of water is not helpful. Also buy the one with 6 in 1 vs 7 in 1.  Who’s going to make yogurt?  I thought if it had recipes sure I might try it but even the humongous Instant Pot Bible cookbook Bible I got doesn’t have instruments for that it’s so infrequently used. Bottoms line at this point I’m going back to my digital pressure cooker and slow cooker and this will take a spot on a shelf in the garage. It’s pretty much useless without directions/recipes/instructions for beginners. Unfortunately after my success with boiling water I discarded the box otherwise it would be going to back from whence it came.  Save your $. Instant Pot doesn’t have online instructions either unfortunately."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've used stovetop and electric pressure cookers for a long time, and was excited to get on the Instant Pot train - I've given them as gifts to my kids and knew they did more than traditional pressure cookers.  But after the second use, I had a problem: the contents would start the countdown and finish the recipe without ever actually sealing the lid.  I was disappointed and mad at myself for getting a ""gadget"". Right away, I emailed customer service. I got a very prompt reply from Tasha, and she worked with me for 2 days explaining what went wrong.  She also explained how my ""fix"" wasn't really a ""fix"", so I learned something I thought I already knew.  The problem was mine, but she never made me feel that way and walked me through a few tests.  Bottom line is there are some variables that will possibly make your pot seem defective - but customer service will walk you through your issue and teach you a few things along the way.  Don't hesitate to contact support! I have complete confidence in this appliance, because of their commitment to an excellent customer experience.  I also love the recipe support.  Thanks, Tasha!"
1.0 out of 5 stars,I have had this unit for a little over a month.  I have loved it.  Love making egg bites for my wife who has a lot of health problems.  Has worked perfect.  I have used it almost every day.  Tonight I decided to make more egg bites Using the same recipe and for some reason they came out not no where near done.  Can't figure out what happened because in the past they were perfect.  What bothers me is I have convinced several of my friends to buy one.  Hope they don't have this problem because I recommended it to them.  I will not recommend again because I had hoped it would work for a few years. Not for me to have a duo. The first one was replaced with another one and it does not work.  Went to Walmart and bought a lux and it works like a champ.
1.0 out of 5 stars,"I have two other Instant Pots (6 qt) and have enjoyed using them, but often needed larger capacity for some dishes. We were really looking forward to the 8qt Instant Pot , but it does not perform the same way as the 6qt. We followed all the best practices for liquid use, keeping the bottom of the pot clean, not overloading the pot, and working with a cool unit prior to starting the pressure cycle. No matter how many times we tried, the unit throws a ""burn"" warning and turns itself off- sometimes prior to reaching pressure, sometimes after reaching pressure, but we never got the intended ""countdown"" phase to initiate. The same recipe and steps were successful in the 6qt pots. Returning this unit as defective, and based on many Instant Pot recipe sites, others are experiencing the same problem with newer 8qt pots."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"My wife kept telling me we should get this. For months I resisted. We had a crock pot, so why bother? We finally got this on sale on black Friday, and I LOVE IT.  Quicker than a crock pot and better end results. You can season your protien and cook it with veggies (which take on the flavor as well). After using this, anything you cook in a crock pot seems like a warm, swampy product. Anything you cook in this is moist, flavorful, tender excellence in just a fraction of the time. Do not hesitate to buy this product - you will thank yourself for meals to come."
1.0 out of 5 stars,"The second time I used the unit it came up to pressure, started the timer countdown, and after 2 minutes totally died. I checked wiring, tried a different electrical socket, but the unit would not start."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"What a great way to save time in cooking! Since I bought the 3-Quart model, there aren't that many accessories available for it yet (like pot cover). For a single person, the 3-qt. size is big enough, but most recipes (a ton of recipe books are available on Kindle) are portioned for the 6-qt. size and have to be scaled down. This thing is incredibly great at making rice and rice dishes, as well as hot cereals and grains like quinoa. Soups, stews and chilis are a breeze. The timer and modes of the unit make flawless pressure-cooking possible. Be careful not to fill the internal pot above the maximum fill line, or you'll make a mess. The whole thing is very well-built and seems like it will last a long time. I am using it to cook more than half of my meals, and that really surprises me. For vegans, this little pot opens up a method for making great vegan dishes quickly and easily. I have also used it to make some really great Thai and Indian curries as well as some Chinese recipes. I even made some bread pudding that turned out great. The internal stainless pot is very solid and easy to clean up (unless you burn something while sautéing). Make sure you have adequate liquid in the bottom of the pot when steaming."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"Addictive to use, and an immense time saver.  Now you can spend time with anyone you've invited over without having to monitor everything in the kitchen.  I've only used 50% of the buttons, so there is much more to learn.  The only horrible aspect is that the silicon ring in the lid picks up scents from everything you've cooked.  It's impossible to enjoy curry flavored oatmeal."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"I made my purchase after reading many reviews, so the design and function are good.  I waited a while to make this review so that I could get to know the appliance.  So here goes....  I love using my Instant Pot more every time I use it.  With only a little adjustment I have adapted many of my recipes and  become totally in love with the ease of using a pressure cooker.  I still haven't made yogurt yet, but look forward to success with that as well."
1.0 out of 5 stars,"Ok perhaps I got a dud.  Make quinoa following the instructions and the water didn't evaporate (no worries, just drained it and made a quinoa salad).  But I just opened the IP after 16 hours to make yogurt and it's still in liquid barely warm.So incredibly disappointed after wasting expensive products for the yogurt!!!I really hope to replace it and start loving it like everyone else but so far I'm not happy."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great little cooker!  I was looking for a rice cooker, then opted to try this as it's more versatile.  I have limited counter space and was reluctant to buy the 6qt.  It's just my husband and I now, so I felt I would not need to make larger meals.  The downside is, very few recipes for the mini and I am not courageous enough to alter the 6qt recipes. quite yet, but I will experiment some. The little cookbook that comes with it has some strange meals I would never like. Instruction manual is good, it took a few tries to make my Jasmine rice perfect, but I got it!  It is easy to use once you practice a little.  I did make some awesome shredded Mexican beef in it too.  Like all the bloggers say about these Instant Pots, don't give up and keep experimenting. I did buy extra rings to have on hand, that was good advice from some others.  There is a little colander bowl that fits perfectly in the 3qt for steaming you can buy here  on Amazon https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00BR4GWN2/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o06_s01?ie=UTF8&psc=1.  All in all, pretty happy with it, I use it about once a week."
1.0 out of 5 stars,TOTAL GARBAGE.  I am a professional chef and this thing is garbage.  The slow cook mode can’t get hot enough to actuallly slow cook. The pressure modes are all inconsistent and great mushy uneven textures.  I wish I could have returned the garbage.
2.0 out of 5 stars,"Sorry I fell for all the hype around this machine.  It does so much, but basically it's a pressure cooker with a lot of buttons and fussiness to drive you crazy because everything you cook needs a little tweak.  For example, the rice button really is just for one type of rice, and any variation of rice will have to be researched and tested.I haven't come across one recipe that has been improved upon in taste and consistency by this machine.  So if you love to cook, and love the process to it, then I'd advise to skip this appliance.  I'm pretty certain it will end up in the bread machine heap one day.  But if you're still using your bread machine, then go for it.  That's the true target audience.  Folks who want to throw everything in a pot at once, with low expectations.Also, after just a few weeks of minimal use, the little condensation receptacle no longer stays on because the sliver of plastic that keeps it in place broke off.  I contacted customer service, and the person acted incredulous, and wanted to blame it on some action of mine.  I was also informed that this part was not under warranty.Lastly, I don't believe this company has any dedicated customer service staff.  Sounds like they farm out this task to another company or hire freelancers because the few times I've called, it takes forever to reach someone, and thenthe person sounds like they are working from home, and you're intruding on their personal time."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Bought this to use as a slow cooker so I also bought the Instant Pot Glas lid with it..  I simply couldn't find a slow cooker that slow cooked.  The last one that I bought boiled on the keep warm setting.  The IP has worked perfectly as a slow cooker.  5 stars for that function.  Then I started seeing all kinds of things about pressure cooking.  Wow, what a bandwagon and I have jumped on to that band wagon!  Every recipe that I have tried has turned out.  A bit of a learning curve.  One has to read the manual!  Ropa Vieja, cabbage burgers, pot roast and CHEESE CAKE were great.  I have found that for most recipes some additional seasoning.is required.  Roasts and chicken are very tender.  Ribs are tasty but not like those that are done on a grill or smoker but they are done in 1hour!  A very versatile tool.  Cook everything from pot roast to yogurt, cheesecake to stuffed cabbage, rice to stew, fish to soup and I could go on."
3.0 out of 5 stars,"I am so upset at Instant Pot. My wife has seen all the videos, reviews, and photos of Instant Pot are were very excited to make the purchase, but Instant Pot made a significant change to their INNER POT. The inner pots no longer contain the Cups and Liters marking. This is very inconvenient for those who want to cook rice, as this marking is common for any cookers for rice. It seems like they made this change through out their entire line up. Even the high end Ultra version lacks the Cups and Liters marking. I then checked additional inner pots available for sale separately and it looks like they also have been changed. The stainless steel inner pot sold as an accessory does not have the cups and liters marking, but it does seem like the non-stick ones do.I thought about purchasing the non-stick inner pot just for the marking, but my experience with rice cookers is that the non-stick coating does not last very long before it begins to peel.I have tried to contact Instant Pot via their website multiple times, and they have not responded to me. I believe they are significantly doing an injustice to those who want to use the Instant Pot for cooking rice. My question is why make such a dumb change like this? They had the marking before, why would they take them away.Pot works fine other than this really irritating change that they made. I would really like to hear a response from them as to why such a stupid change."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love cooking with my Instant Pot. I've found tons of amazing recipes and you can literally get dinner on the table in 30 minutes or less depending on what you're making. It's amazing for making broths, soups and stocks but the possibilities are endless. My favorites are applesauce, rice pudding and turkey with gravy--all easy and delicious! I can't imagine not having one in my kitchen now. Other than the reduced cook time, the next best thing is all the functions it performs. For me, appliances have to earn their place in my kitchen and this one definitely does. I love that I can saute right in the pot then add the rest of the ingredients, program it and walk away. I also love the slow cooker and rice maker functions and that I don't need separate appliances for each.Unfortunately, after four months one of the sensors failed and it stopped working. I didn't remove a star because the Instant Pot customer service was awesome. I submitted the ticket online, along with my proof of purchase from Amazon and a video of the error. Within 10 minutes they had responded requesting additional information, and within a total of 30 minutes of me submitting a ticket they emailed me the tracking number for the new base they were shipping me. Talk about responsive!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I first learned of Instant Pot on a Facebook forum. I did some research on electric pressure cookers and realized this one was the one to buy. I haven't had it for long, but it's been great so far. I made the most delicious Lemon Garlic Chicken! It fast and easy. I haven't even scratched the surface of what I can do with this thing. Since this is the most popular brand, there is numerous FB groups and other forums for advice and recipes. My next culinary creation is going to be cheesecake using my Fat Daddio Push Pan. According to the numerous owners in the ""club"" cheesecake is easy and fabulous in the Instant Pot. One thing I would advise is to buy an extra silicone ring, one for savory and one for sweet dishes. The silicone seal absorbs the aroma of onions and garlic and can ""contaminate"" your sweet desserts like cheesecake with the smell of what you last cooked. They can be ordered on Amazon for just a few dollars and are definitely worth the extra money. The 8 quart rings currently take 10-12 weeks to arrive, but hopefully won't take as long at some point in the future. It's always good to have an extra ring anyway. In my opinion, the manufacturer should include an extra ring in the box with the product.One other thing: if you're trying to decide between the 6 quart and the 8 quart, buy the 8 quart. Most people in the IP (Instant Pot) community say if you're buying your first one, you should buy the larger one. Yes, I said your first one. Most people end up buying a second one because it's so versatile and replaces other kitchen appliances like your rice cooker, slow cooker, etc. My ""geriatric"" rice cooker is not going to last much longer, and when it dies, I plan to buy another IP to replace it. Also, be prepared to want to buy some ""accessories"" for your new IP such as the pan I mentioned above. This is so fun to experiment with, you'll want to try to cook things you've never tried before (like cheesecake)."
2.0 out of 5 stars,"I can't decide about the Instant pot yet, because it's new to me, but I can list the pros and cons---PROS:  Cooking time with a pressure cooker is great, and so far the finished meal is pretty good;  It's easy to clean; & for a quick cooking appliance, it's ten times better than a microwave.CONS: It's difficult to work with the first few times, and the steam vent doesn't work as described , so it isn't so easy to use.  I thought it was a slow cooker, and it is programmable as one, but the pot is too small for a decent sized chicken or roast.WORST:  With such a small pot, you have to brown things in batches, and this is very awkward, especially because its a small & Deep pot.  A frying pan is easier.  There are actually more steps than I'd normally need with the stove-top method.  The small pot means no extra large portions of a dish for leftovers, vs. a big pot on the stove top.  (That's where crock pots that are shallow and wide are better for cooking, even though they take all day - - that's the whole idea)."
1.0 out of 5 stars,"I have this instapot for six months, and in that time I used it at most 10 times. And it died. On the 10th time I push the start for pressure, and the timer was going but it wasn’t getting hot and it wasn’t building pressure. So I turned it off and started it back up again and it worked. Except that those 3 minute eggs took an hour because of the time it took just to get the machine to work. And then I try to use it again, and no digital screen, nothing works. I’ve tried all my kitchen outlets, my outlets are fine.Now I’m trying to get my money back through the warranty and I paid for. Stay tuned."
1.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought this Instant Pot in May of 2017.  It went out on me this week. For $161.14, I expected it to last longer. Customer service tried to put 5be blame on me, but I have treated it like a baby. The problem is the fuse. You can go on YouTube and see how to fix it. You can even order the replacement fuse on Amazon. It’s just so complicated and dangerous I’m sure some people won’t bother...and why should they? The IP was dreamed up by Canadians, but are manufactured in China.  What does that tell ya?  I’m just sorry I’ve told so many people how great they are. Got a lot of untelling to do."
2.0 out of 5 stars,"I had a different Instant Pot for at least five years, and it worked perfectly...but then I accidentally set the lid down on a hot burned and melted it. Instead of just replacing the lid, I thought I would be the perfect opportunity to “upgrade” to one with a yogurt function. Unfortunately I’ve had nothing but problems with this newer model- it spews liquid from the steam release handle even once the pot has come to pressure and had started cooking. My results are incredibly inconsistent. I’ve been in contact with customer support and they sent me a new handle and base, but I’m still having problems. Maybe it’s the lid?! At this point I wish they would have just sent me an entirely new pot, and I really regret not just replacing the lid of my old one!"
2.0 out of 5 stars,"Negatives: High learning curve. The manual devotes much space to safety issues, somewhat redundantly, but is not so clear on actual use of the pot. Thankfully, some online cookbooks are more explicit. The pot is larger than I expected, so storage is an issue and it takes up lots of space on the counter when in use.  The overall design seems fine, except the labels for the steam release handle were impossible for me to read (black on black) and the manual does not have a useful diagram. Thankfully the proper setting is easy to remember but my first use of the pot was delayed until someone could help me determine the correct setting.My first attempt was beef stew, using a recipe from an instant pot cook book. The vegetables were overcooked and mushy, so I won't be using the IP for stew again. Second attempt was beef short ribs. This was an improvement over the stew but the vegetables were, again, good additions for seasoning the ribs and gravy but too overcooked to enjoy at the table. Third attempt: brown rice. My old rice cooker took about one hour to cook brown rice ready to serve. The time savings were not significant with the iP from start to serve. The IP documentation and many online recipes mislead by stating only pressurized cook times.My next foray with iP will be a curry with Jasmine rice steamed simultaneously in the pot. Before that attempt, I have to buy *one more* accessory for steaming the rice. If that doesn't come out well, I may give up on IP or use it only as a slow cooker."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"If my house caught on fire while I was in the shower, and I had only enough time to grab a robe, I would instead run to my kitchen, grab the instant pot, then flee my burning home, naked, wet, and screaming with shampoo in my eyes. That's how much I love my instant pot.If you want to change your life, drastically and completely, then you must own this sleek and beautiful machine. I don't cook. I'm busy with a full-time job and a business, I'm single with no kids, and I am not especially romanced by food. It is basically fuel and I don't like doing lots of dishes just to eat a meal that took too much effort. However, when I realized I needed to put the bare minimum of effort into my nutrition, I asked around and heard about this mythical beast that made life simple and delicious. I dump in some rice and spices, or beans, press a few buttons, and move on with my life until the machine beeps. I know others who own multiple and make beautiful, elaborate, hearty meals with meats and other sides in their instant pots, so that is an option for those who love to cook as well."

I hadn’t cooked with one previously so I was skeptical and a little intimidated but once you read through the safety guide and instruction manual its was pretty user friendly and my dinners turned out delicious. It is so great to cook a roast to perfection in under an hour. It does have a lot of functions so there is a learning curve and you need to be careful about releasing the pressure before taking the lid off, otherwise the sky is the limit the Instant Pot can replace many Kitchen gadgets for cooking, baking, sautéing, steaming.....and much more! Enjoy!"
4.0 out of 5 stars,"The first time I used it was when company was visiting and it would not allow me to set the time for over 30 minutes, and the recipe required 1 hour!  I called company for assist and able to get representative quickly however, it did take them a while to figure out the entire machine needed to be reset.  They guided me step by step to reset it, which was easy but the entire ordeal was successful.  TIP: Try out all new electronic items before actually depending on them.I also found that their instructions for ""fall off the bone""  meat (roast, pork chops..)  on ""Meat/Stew"" setting cooks it for 45 minutes and the meat is done however, NOT close to ""southern peoples, fall of the bone"" expectations.  Therefore, I press the ""Meat/Stew"" button for the 45 min cooking as directed, then when alarm goes off I (do NOT open the lid) just push the ""Meat/Stew"" button again and let it cook  another 45 min.  I'm sure I could use the ""manual"" method to set it for 120 minutes however, apparently I'm too lazy to figure out how to use the manual option."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my first Instant Pot.  For the first week-ish I kind of didn't know what I wanted to do with it/was a bit apprehensive to use it.  The first thing I tried to cook (some steel cut oats) burned and ended up as cement on the bottom of the steel pot.  My mistake...not adding extra water.  Good rule of thumb with these is add 1/2 cup or more extra liquid to the pot on most non liquid-based recipes.  The nice thing was, the pot realized it was burnt, beeped, displayed a burn message and shut the heat off, keeping it from becoming a smoking mess.These days, I load it up, set the timer for when I want it to cook and forget about it.  It takes a bit of time to get used to, but is a really great cooker.  It's actually my most used meal cooking tool.One thing to consider when you are purchasing one is how many people are you cooking for?  If you are just cooking for yourself, you may be better off with a smaller one.  If you are cooking for multiple people, this works wonderfully for that.  While I tend to only cook for myself, I tend to make 2-5 servings of something and store it away to save time later.  If I was just cooking meal-to-meal, for myself, I would probably get a 4qt model or smaller.One very nice feature of it is it's warming feature.  By default, when a meal is done, it will go into warming mode to keep it nice as long as you leave it on.  Great for stews and meals that you are going to go back to later in the day or when you start something, get busy and come back x hours later."
1.0 out of 5 stars,"We purchased Instant Pot Duo Mini 3 Qt 7-in-1​ from Amazon during the Thanksgiving sale. We are regular users of traditional pressure cooker and thought this will be a great multi-purpose device. However, in the last 3 weeks we have had 4 episodes where the gasket leaked and the pressure was suddenly released causing food to splatter everywhere. The first time we thought we made a mistake in seating the gasket, but am fairly confident (now that it has happened multiple times) that this is due to a defective item. Every time this has happened, we have had to spend hours cleaning up the mess. Will be reaching out to support to see if they will help with a replacement or return"
2.0 out of 5 stars,"I am so sad to have to write a negative review for this product because it worked well for a few months and during that time we loved it and recommended it to all our friends. Then, it just unexpalinably stopped working, steam coming out of all sides and our poor food inside having to be thrown away. The worst part of our experience with InstantPot was their customer service department. We wrote them directly with extensive video, photo and explanation of the problem. Then followed months of them writing multiple emails asking us to perform more tests, take more videos (of the exact same things we had already sent video/photo of), clean it again, even though it was practically new and I had already cleaned it extensively before I reached out to them. Over and over we did everything they asked and more. Now, over 3 months and many hours of time later they have agreed to send us a new sealing ring only. This is almost definitely not the problem as the sealing ring is in perfect condition. Given how quickly our InstantPot broke and that this company does not stand behind their defective products, refusing to replace, I have to suggest buying one of the many other brands that sell similar items."

1.0 out of 5 stars,"Nothing instant about it.  A soup in ""5 minutes"" takes almost an hour. It takes 15 minutes to heat up until the pressure starts.  When it's done with the 5 minutes of pressure, it beeps, but if you open the pressure vent right away it sprays soupy mist all over.  So you have to wait a half hour (maybe less but I didn't stay and watch to time it) for the pressure to come down. You can't take it to the sink to run cold water on it to quickly lower the pressure, the way you can with a regular pressure cooker pot, because it weighs too much to carry it. It doesn't beep when the pressure is down. It takes up so much counter space that I put it on a lower cabinet shelf that slides out. If I use it again I'll leave it on the shelf and plug it into an extension cord, since it's way too heavy to keep putting it back up on the counter.  Very disappointed, but I used it so I can't return it."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Use mostly for rice, chili, soups, beans, and eggs. It doesn’t always cut down on cook time when you factor in the time it takes to come to pressure then the time to release but I like that I don’t have to stay by it and watch it like I would if I were cooking on the stove. The keep warm feature is great too!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I’ve had this pot for 2 days & I’ve already made rice, butter chicken, chicken and dumplings, mac n cheese, and loaded potato soup!  I’m super impressed.  Some of the dishes don’t save a ton of time once it comes up to pressure then you release the pressure, but the flavor is like you cooked it all day and you basically throw the ingredients in the pot & wait for it to finish. Instead of standing over a hot stove & then being too tired to even eat what I cooked, I just put it in, have a glass of wine, then it’s ready.  Something like a roast I’m sure would save a lot of time.I really like that all the controls are on the base unit, so the top can be immersed in water for cleaning unlike the pressure cooker I have. The 6 quart is the perfect size for a family of 4. The inner pot fits in the dishwasher perfectly, unlike my crockpot liner & is stainless steel so it’s good for canning & you can use any type of utensils in it (no nonstick coating to contend with).The sauté mode is amazing because it makes creating one pot meals a breeze...perfect for browning meat before cooking or thickening sauces after cooking.I bought a couple of cookbooks to go with my pot as I learn how to use it. The manual is great, but the small recipe booklet that comes with it is limited. I was able to Google some recipes that were great.  There’s also an official Facebook group (members are called pot heads) you can join for tips, recipes, questions, etc. 😀I purchased extra seals to go with my pot because I cook a lot of spicy foods & read sometimes the seal can absorb the ordor. It will be good to have one for sweets and one for savory dishes. They even make a two pack of red & blue seals so you know which one is which.  And, I’ll be set if they become hard to get. I plan on using the heck out of this thing!Obviously, I highly recommend!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"All right, I rarely write a review, but this Instant Pot is too awesome not to add to the already incredibly convincing reviews about it.I just receive my IP-DUO08 (the big one) last Thursday night.  Friday I cooked rice in it as the first thing...came out great.  Then I had 3 frozen chicken breasts, so I busted those out and did 'em up after the rice.  I've never had such perfectly cooked, hot (heat hot), tender and juicy chicken breasts.  And that was just for starters...So then on Saturday I bought a 4.5 pound chuck roast.  I seared it up first just as you see people do it on the youtubes.  Just look up ""Instant Pot"" and whatever you want to cook, like ""pot roast"" or ""chile"", etc.  I seasoned it up w/ all the regular stuff...nothin' fancy...everyone will use whatever they like to use, so do your thing, it will all come out great in the end.Then I set it on the high pressure meat setting along w/ 2 big chopped sweet yellow onions and let it go for about 35 mins.  After that I released the pressure and opened it up.  All was cooked great already, but then I added chopped up yellow skin taters and carrots which was all I had handy at the time.  Closed it back up again for another 15 mins.I basically turned it into a big stew...and it turned out fantastic.  So easy and only took about 90 mins along w/ prepping time to clean and cut up everything first.So today, since all the ""stew"" had already been wiped out, I seasoned and seared up 2 huge pork tenderloins.  Did same thing as with the chuck roast...pressure cooked them w/ a couple more onions for 35 mins, then opened it up again and added in all the rest of the carrots, onions, and taters I still had left over from before that I didn't use w/ the roast.However...with the pork tenderloins I added in 3 cups of Mojo marinade to give it that Mojo flavor kick.  This was awesome...you all gotta do it.Then I pressure cooked it all again for another 15 mins along w/ letting it de-pressurize naturally for about 10 mins afterwards.  Then I let out the rest of the steam pressure using the quick release valve and opened it up.Again...absolutely amazing.  I basically created a shredded Mojo pork tenderloin stew that is incredible tasting.  Best thing I've ever made and it was only the 3rd thing I've cooked up yet w/ this pot.  I could have added all kinds of other stuff, celery, peppers, etc., but I just didn't have them at the time.  But now that I know how to use this thing w/ the basics and have the timing down, there's no limit to experimenting and cooking up great stuff.And I do recommend getting the 8 quart size unit rather than the 6.  I have the 8 and it's just easy to tell that any unit smaller than this would make it difficult for good size stew type meals or other things like big roaster size chickens, or ribs, etc.  You gotta have the extra room for liquids and other things like lots of carrots, taters, onions, etc.  And with the 8 it seems just big enough for that kinda stuff.  I think if I had bought the 6 I would be frustrated w/ the smaller size, and there also might be more of a chance of overloading it and over pressurizing the smaller one if it's too loaded up.  Better to have the extra room in the 8 size.  Just sayin'...Some pics are attached."
1.0 out of 5 stars,"I cannot find any recipes for the 3 quart model.  Even the stupid recipe book that they enclosed with the 3 quart instant pot if for the 6 quart version.  I have even tried searching the instant pot website recipes specifically for 3 quart recipes, and get recipes that are for the 6 quart.  Same thing for searching the internet.  The cookbooks that I have found on Amazon or other web searches all claim to be for 3 quart, but they are not.  So you think, well, just halve the recipe for a 6 quart and use those amounts for a 3 quart.  NOT that simple.  First, there are limited functions on a 3 quart than a 6 quart, and you cannot get things like steamer baskets and other accessories that support the 6 quart and many recipes call for.  Second, if you don't use enough liquid, you will get scorch errors on the instant pot, and who knows that that formula is for liquid to solids??? Not Instant Pot apparently because their website and info included with the 3 quart don't provide any guidance.  Basically, this is an expensive oatmeal and rice cooker.  Save your money."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"I am the last one in my big family to get one. I was scared to use a pressure cooker. The directions to get started are terrible. They don't match what I was looking at. When I finally get through the water test, I found there were no receipes included. A small booklet would have been helpful. I found Mexican Stew and it was wonderful! Cooked fast and the meat was so tender. Can hardly wait to cook something else."
1.0 out of 5 stars,"Got it for Christmas and I was so excited! Looked over recipes, chose a good one, filled the pot with a roast and spices, etc., and plugged it in. All the lights flashed with a ""C1"" error. I tried several buttons, replugged several times, and called customer support. They said to send it back--it's broken. No other buttons worked. My family was hungry and I was grumpy. Bad experience. BTW, the 3 qrt. size sounds small, but it's actually quite big and heavy."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm tired when I get home from work and the absolute last thing I want to do is spend an hour or two cooking dinner.  I was falling into the bad habit of picking up take out or buying microwaveable processed food.  While those things got dinner on the table fast, they were also causing me to gain weight and spend a ridiculous amount of money every week.  I knew that I needed to do something to break me out of my rut.  I had heard great things from friends and co-workers about the Instant Pot so I finally broke down and bought one and what a good decision that was.So far, I've made  a couple of batches of three bean chili (using dried beans), veggie lasagna, a vegetable curry, black bean soup, and a mushroom bourguignon.  I also made a ratatouille which is a dish that I love but didn't make very often because it took so long from start to finish.  The Instant Pot shaved the total time down to about 40 minutes and that included chopping up the veggies and cleaning up.  I feel so much better eating fresh, simple food and I'm saving money by not stopping at Chipotle or another take out place every night.So far, I haven't run into any issues with it. It works just fine and it's easy to clean and easy to use.  I think anyone who wants a hot, home cooked meal but doesn't have a lot of time to spend in the kitchen would do well to invest in one of these."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I live alone, always looking for a way to make small portions, reduce waste. After looking at countless pressure cookers, I had 2 friends with this brand. Gave it a try - WOW, works exactly as advertised. I did have to look up some of the conversion settings. There are plenty of sites showing this along with lots of ways to make almost anything. This size was my biggest concern. If I had company, would this cook for two OK? The answer is yes. Even three, pending on what you make. There is a learning curve as always. Remember the first time using a microwave? same learning curve. Guess I am dating my self, but it is simple after the first few times.Frozen chicken - set to 17 minutes or so, takes about 24 minutes from start to finish and comes out very tender.Rice - perfect every time, although minute rice no so good, seems to over cook it and it gets stickyRIBs - Cut them to fit, added sauce, water - came out better than I expected.A few other things I tried came out good.Nice pressure cooker!"
1.0 out of 5 stars,"I got this product two month ago, At First month it's worked wonderful and I'm falling love with the instant pot now i hate it it stop wok, the unit had no power anymore, so I contact the customer service dept. O My God they tried to avoid the problem & issues that I had the services are nasty and screwed up that I'm not gonna buy any product from them ever ever again"
1.0 out of 5 stars,"Loved the pot, it worked as described, very impressive. Then 2'nd time I tried to use it keeps blowing the GFCI. Confirmed nothing wrong with the outlet, pot is dry, no damage,  the pot has a short circuit, blows the GFCI, and no longer works.  Useless. Total waste. ???"
1.0 out of 5 stars,"PURCHASE AT YOUR OWN RISK.....What are the odds of getting 3 defective units in a row within two weeks?  With any other product in the world i would say that the chances are slim and none.  Three defective units in two weeks speaks volumes about the poor quality control instant pot must have.  Therefore i cannot recommend this product to anyone.  I wanted to love instant pot and gave them three opportunities.  But with all these defective units, I will never recommend them to anyone.My 3rd instant pot in 2 weeks that has come in defective!  I ordered the instant pot duo plus with amazon gift cards i received from Christmas.  Upon opening it up, I did the initial pressure test.  After the pot came to pressure and the pin was in the up position and the cooking process started, the pot would begin to leak a steady stream of steam about a foot high from the quick release.  So i figured i had gotten a defective.  I was not upset.  I know these things happen so i just refunded it.I then ordered a second instant pot duo.  upon receiving that unit i pulled it out of the box and noticed that the side of the unit was dented in and damaged.  I did not even attempt a pressure test on the unit.  I just repackaged it and refunded the unit.I then ordered a third instant pot.  This time I ordered the Ultra version figuring that it was newer and maybe they worked out any issues with previous models.  It came in, I conducted the initial pressure test and it also failed the pressure test.I called instant pot and asked them if it was normal for constant pressure to be released after the pot came to pressure and the cooking process has begun.  They immediately told me that this was not normal and that i have a defective unit.These units are poor quality.  PURCHASE AT YOUR OWN RISK."
1.0 out of 5 stars,"This would be a great multipurpose cooker IF it worked correctly. I have my doubts about reliability after discovering how ERRATIC the pressure regulation can be. After contacting their customer service with a few back and forth emails they did decide my unit was defective, but they need two pics of the serial number on the bottom and label on the back for whatever warranty reasons they require. All I can say is ""the brain"" was ""brain dead"" in the way its control panel could not work properly with the pressure regulation and/or heating element. I don't know what was defective, but this thing was ""nuts"". Sometimes it would pressurize, and without rhyme or reason it would not pressurize more often than it would. Totally erratic!I'll update this review after I test the replacement. I'm glad I bought the extended warranty, because I'm not a believer in the reliability of these IP cookers. Why? I already had a Version 1 of this same Duo cooker I bought in 2015, and, yes, it was defective too! Seemed to have the same pressure regulation problems, but, luckily, I had an extended warranty that saved the day when it failed outside of the one year IP warranty.Will the third one work and be ""the charm"" for me??? I'll update this review once I know..."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"WE LOVE OUR INSTANT POT. I will admit I was late to join this group on IP owners. I did not think the product would live up to all the hype.This past Christmas when asked by my amazing Mother in Law what we could use....I was at a loss to answer. She had suggested this item to use. Due to not really needing anymore appliances we said ""sure"".The box set unopen till after the new year, when I finally decided to give it a shot. My first challenge would be a whole frozen chicken.In 60 minutes....1 HOUR we had a full cooked delicious whole chicken. To say I was impressed would be a huge understatement. This has become a huge staple in my cooking. I cook 80 %- 85 % of our meals from home each month. This item allows for my husband and I to cut the time spent in the kitchen in half. We get more time back in our day to spend with our children.That reason alone has me sold on this product. Since the chicken we have made Spaghetti, Lasagna, Pot Roast, Mashed Potatoes, Enchiladas, Rice, Beans, Burgers, Desserts, Eggs, steamed veggies, soup, ham, fish, chicken, pork and so much more.The devices allows for you to pressure cook, slow cook, and saute. This unit (from amazon) was purchased for my mother as a gift. She has not stop using it since it arrived at her door.I am slowly convincing my husband into purchasing a 2nd one to have to make multiple dishes at once. We will forever have an Instant Pot in our home."
3.0 out of 5 stars,"first I should admit that my expectations were pretty high. I thought I would be throwing stuff into a pot and in an hour or so...bam! dinner!I love my instant pot for cooking frozen meat when I forget to set it out. it's fantastic at cooking rice.  I appreciate the saute setting so I can make soup at work. and I like that when I don't feel like smoking  pulled pork (this is rare) I can pressure cook it and it's really tender.I have yet find a recipe where things all cook together and come out right. the soups I make take just as long on the stovetop, usually with less steps. (the steps some of these recipes take to accomplish something in this pot... good god!)so it's not something I use daily.... or even weekly to be honest. but it is so so so handy when you want to eat and everything is frozen. like, worth 3 stars handy."
1.0 out of 5 stars,"Kept it for two weeks, tried multiple recipes using different methods and all the food just tastes moist but all the flavor is lost. Made a cake in it too and it had the consistency of baby food. The cooking instructions it comes with are extremely lacking and it doesn't provide instructions on how to cook basic foods. Totally underwhelming. It isn't even fast like it claims, it takes the same amount of time as standing in front of the stove. I'll stick to my crock pot."
3.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased this after I had a 6qt that was bulky to move around. This Instant Pot 3qt size is decent for making a week's worth of food for 1 person. You could probably still make a meal for up to 4 but likely would not have leftovers. Actually even when I made my meals I found that the pot filled quickly and I would have to stop because I would be at fill max without adding a lot. This is the only size down from the 6qt so I wish there was a smaller or slightly larger version ie 2.5 qt or 4 qt.For safety features I was largely disappointed. I got burnt by the vent even after waiting 20 minutes and pushing it from the angled tip. Another time I made soup and vented after letting it depressurize by itself. The vent sputtered hot liquid everywhere. Also my unit was purchased from the Amazon Warehouse and it was missing the condensation cup. I tried to contact Instant Pot but had no reply. I also noticed that the lock mechanism on my pot was not secure. Once locked the lid could still jostle around. This wiggling may be standard for an Instant Pot but I did not feel secure using the pot and not having it explode in my face. I had a previous pot from a different company. That pot had a dual lid closure where the 'hinge' itself felt flimsy but when the lid was locked for pressuring it did not move or jostle around. That pot also did not have an angle tip on the vent, it was just a cylindrical vent but anytime I vented it I never had severe stem or liquid overflow and burn me. The lack of safety is the reason I returned this Instant Pot.The hardware of this pot is sturdy and the plastic is matte so it looks and feels nicer. Cleaning the lid was not easy. I had to wash it several times to get rid of residue from one use.The pot was versatile and the main reason I bought it was so that I could make my meals without having to stand by the stove for hours. The only issue I had was the controls. It did not seem intuitive even with the presets. It is described as 7 in 1 but most of the presets had similar settings. On manual, you would have to switch off the Keep warm function. Then it would take up to 15 minutes to come up to pressure which seems really long. I am at an average elevation so that can't be a huge factor. The previous pot I had would take at the most 2 minutes to come to pressure and that was a larger pot.I know Instant Pot is a leader in this market however if I had never had another company's electric pressure cooker I may have kept this Instant Pot. Since I know there are pots that offer better security and ease of controls I would not recommend this at the top of my list. The size is a benefit as there aren't a lot of small electric pressure cookers."
1.0 out of 5 stars,I purchased the 3 QT primarily to cook rice and farro.  I read the rave reviews and thought it was a great machine for this and any other cooking I want to use for.  I have made 4 batches now and none come out well.  Most of the reviews are for 6 or 8 QT and the machines have more functionality than the 3QT which I didn't realize when purchasing.  The 3QT does not have a brown rice (multigrain) function.  Even the recipe booklet is useless.  Waste of money for me and not worth the hype at all.
4.0 out of 5 stars,I ordered the three quart version and it is just perfect for two to four people. So far everything I have made has turned out great and it cooks so quickly. A couple of things I wasn't happy about are the lid and the steam nozzle seem a bit wonky and likely to break. Also the power cord doesn't appear to always connect properly. The manual I received with it seems to be for a customer in the United Kingdom as the settings are for yoghurt and porridge instead of cake and the recipes were definitely not American. No big deal but it made the manual basically useless to me. I just googled instant pot recipes. I have MS and it is so convenient to be able to cook meals in one pot in a short amount of time. I love that you can brown meat on saute and then slow cook or pressure cook it depending on how much time you have.Would definitely purchase again but would have been nice if more settings were actually useful.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Instant Pot...I think I love you!  Gave this as a gift to my grandma and she asked me to help her figure it out.  We made chili in it tonight from scratch using dry beans we had not soaked ahead of time.  The chili turned out fantastic!  The pot was super easy to use.  I did learn very quickly though that if you use the vent release valve manually that the first puff of steam that comes out is super hot (duh, i'm blonde what can I say, thank God I didn't have my face over it)...anyway, after that initial wake up call I began using a wooden spoon to activate the valve that way my fingers are far away!  Worked like a charm!  Can't convince my grandma though that this pressure cooker is safe.  All afternoon she told me stories of her childhood where people back east would die using the old ones.  It will take some time to convert her and convince her that it is safe to use but I know she will come around.  Tomorrow night i'm making a pot roast in it :)  Don't know why I waited so long to get on the Instant Pot party bus.  Great gift and great buy!"
3.0 out of 5 stars,"First of all let me state that we love this product and use it all the time. Makes great food and once you have one it’s hard to live without it.That being said, I do have to bring up a very crucial design flaw. The other night, we were making Thai Green Curry using the sauté setting and the glass lid and accidentally let the pot boil over. The green curry liquid flowed down the side of the stainless steel pot and into the heating well, where it then proceeded to drip down through the inner electronic workings in the bottom of the pot and out through the vents on the bottom, completely ruining the entire thing. It is very disappointing that it is designed this way. Such a commonly owned high dollar machine should not be so easily ruined. Also could have been a safety issue and could have caused some kind of electrical fire or something if not unplugged so quickly. It was a soul crushing experience and we were unable to finish cooking the entire batch of food as well. We have ordered another one and spent another $130... hoping to get a lot longer lifespan out of this one..."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"My wife and I were uncertain whether we were interested in an air fryer, but the price of this secondary lid for the Instant Pot was pretty reasonable so we gave it a go. Thus far we have air fried french fries, cauliflower and brussel sprouts and we've been pretty happy with them compared to their fried or oven-roasted equivalents. We're taking notes as we try different times and temperatures, and I'm confident we'll dial in the overall recipes as we go along."
3.0 out of 5 stars,"I have been using this for several months now. There is definitely a learning curve with the pressure cooker! I like the saute feature which saves dirtying another pan. However, I have noticed several times that after sauteing, and turning the instant pot off, then turning it to either slow cook or pressure cook that my meal is nearly ruined because it is still sauteing. Yes, I turned it off and then selected another cooking mode and it still sautes. Now I have to double check it, turn it off again and reselect the new mode. I don't think this is acceptable, therefore my 3 rating."
1.0 out of 5 stars,"The instapot broke itself.

3.0 out of 5 stars,"Loved this pot the first time I used it. It made broth in just a few hours. It made melt-in-your-mouth pot roast in about an hour. I used it about 5 or 6 times, and then the last time I used it steam leaked out the rim of the lid. I watched the help videos on instant pot's website and discovered my ring was slightly stretched--something they admit can happen, though they say infrequently. Since I was well within the warranty period, I contacted them for a replacement. It took two days for them to get back to me and when they did, it was simply to request a picture. A day later, they sent me a note saying they couldn't see the defect, but that perhaps there was a small cut in the ring that they couldn't see. I did not appreciate being treated in this manner. In person, I could clearly see what they could not in a photo--the ring stretched after use. (And not from improper handling.) They asked for my shipping information and my receipt, which I sent. I am waiting for a reply. I assume they will still replace the ring. (I will update here if they do not.) In the meantime, I ordered a replacement ring myself. I'd like to use my pot on a near daily basis and didn't want to have to wait for slow customer service. Replacement rings are over $10 each and the shipping time on them (even with PRIME) is about a month. Their response could have been quicker and more customer friendly, for sure. I don't mind the price of a new ring if they actually last 2 years. I will be upset if the sealing rings don't last for at least 18 months."
1.0 out of 5 stars,"NOT HAPPY~~If you want a short lived- disposable electronic I guess you will like this product. I paid $132.00 for a new ""Instant Pot"" as a gift for my single son. He only used it a few times before getting sent out of town for business. He left this Instant Pot cooker at his apartment, and it was not used until he got back 8 months later. He finally got interested in fixing his own food verses eating out like he had been doing for way too long. He started looking for new recipes, fixed two meals and then became bummed when the cooker wouldn't even heat up! So, he's used this at the most 8 times. I have two crock pots that are over 15 years old that I use weekly, and they still work perfectly!! I wish the company wouldn't have just shrugged their shoulders at this trouble, and at least tried to make it right... Maybe offer to fix the problem like a dependable company would do! At this point, I will never buy another  product by this company..."

1.0 out of 5 stars,"I accidentally dropped the inner pot (empty) and there was a small dent.  In interest of safety, I searched the Instant Pot website and Amazon for a replacement inner pot, only to learn that InstantPot makes replacement parts for every Duo Nova model size pot except for the 10 quart.Why sell a product that periodically requires replacement parts (i.e., inner pot, sealing rings) if you will not offer your customers replacement parts that fit a size that you sell?I have contacted Instant Pot directly and they confirmed (after ~10 days) that they do not yet sell replacement parts.  There was no empathy for my situation or creative thinking in how they can satisfy this brand new and angry customer.  All I have right now is an expensive paper weight.I like the product enough to buy a smaller size pot that is easier to maintain longer term with replacement parts, but refuse to do so as a matter of principle after my experience with their 10-quart pot."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm firmly an advocate of the Instant Pot craze. : )  Love it. For me the stews and chilis and similar come out the best. If the sauce is too thick though (think stroganoff) I tend to get the dresser ""BURN"" message more often than I would like. But so far not catastrophies or explosions yet. : ) Thinner sauces that do not contain butter or cream seem to do better.I do wonder though whether I should have bought the larger pot instead though. This 3 qt model really does not hold very much given that you have to allow for the steam which uses up about 1/4 of the capacity right there. We are cooking for two adults so I thought the 3 qt would be ideal for us, but now I am not so sure. Any Costco-sized meats which you want to dump into the pot will quickly fill it to overflowing. So if you must make multiple batches of something in order to use up a generous amount of ingredients so that is not such a good bargain in time or electricity or mess. For 1 to 1.5 lbs of meats it is great, beyond that you may not be happy with this size."
1.0 out of 5 stars,"The I.P. was purchased on the recommendation of a friend for making yogurt. Since obtaining the pot, I tried making yogurt at least a half dozen times, with the final product always very runny. On my latest attempt, I measured the final ""boil"" temperature of the milk at 165 degrees when it should have been 180. I sent the pot back through the Yogurt/Boil function again and after 15 minutes, it beeped it had reached temperature. This time, checking the milk with 3 different thermometers (2 were electronic), I saw an average temp of 166 degrees. My thought is that being 15 degrees cooler at a programmed 180, the machine was likely to be cooler at its fermentation temperature. I finished making my yogurt by other means.Attempting to get help from Instant Pot customer service has proven frustrating. They only communicate by email and promise to get back within24 to 48 hours. It's now approaching 72 hours with no communication from them. I am now about to send a third email."

2.0 out of 5 stars,"I woke up Christmas Eve day excited as a little kid to open my brand new instant Pot to cook dinner for the family. Unboxing was fun, I scanned through all the manuals and information sheet and then pulled out the huge 8qt device. I checked all the items listed as included, checked seals and valves. Everything seemed perfect. I turned the unit to look at the display only to see a huge dent near the bottom left of the display. I looked at the package and I didn’t see any notable damage. ??? How could this happen? I don’t get it. At this point I can’t box it up and return it because I have a big family dinner to cook and this was crucial to make the time crunch.  What am I supposed to do now?! Well I continued on with the directions in the manual for initial testing. That all seemed to go as advertised. But it is super annoying that before it’s first use its all dented and bashed up. Hopefully it cooks the pot roast fine and I won’t complain about it every time I see it for the next several years. I’ll put 2 stars for now and adjust it if Christmas isn’t ruined."

Called the customer service, waited about 20 min in line, and was told they won't repair or replace it because I was the one using the pot and spill something, even unintentionally. The customer service spent 20 mins to ""educate"" me that I shouldn't spill anything and told me any similar manufacturer would do exactly the same. Then asked me if I'm willing to pay $90+ for a discounted replacement.  OMG, my brain."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"First off, I deducted a star because the included manual is abysmal. I kept flipping through it looking for seemingly basic information, only to come up empty. After reaching out to friends and family I found that this is a fairly common complaint. I almost deducted more stars because honestly, what good is a product if I can't use it without doing my own research?An example of how useless the manual is:On my first cook my instantpot beeped at me and displayed *BURN* I reached for the manual to see what I should do to remedy the situation, it told me my food was probably burning (never world have guessed the message meant that!) and I needed to clean the pot. I went through the process of cooling the pot down, dumped out my half cooked food and scrubbed the pot before dumping the food back in and restarting the cook. 5 minutes later I was told *BURN* again. After confirming that the manual had no further recommendations I told my pot it could go burn in Halifax and let the cook go on, sure that my food would be charred and I'd be returning the hunk of junk. My food came out fine. It was a little brown on the bottom, but still perfectly edible. I've later learned that to prevent this problem you just need to add some more fluid.)Now that I've consulted experienced instantpot owners and can use my own experience to go on I'm loving this thing. I had resisted buying one for so long partially because I didn't want another gadget taking up my limited kitchen space, I relented when my newly converted friend told me she was able to get rid of her slow cooker, rice cooker and steamer. I don't have a lot of time to cook, and the concept of thinking about making dinner at the same time as breakfast, in the slow cooker, has never caught on with me. So it's great that in the afternoon I can remember that pretty soon I'm expected to feed 4 other humans and toss fully frozen veggies, meat, and the uncooked rice or pasta in and have something tasty pop out in under an hour! Honestly it's an absent minded, busy mother's dream machine and even with the manual that might as well be one page that states ""I don't know man, you figure it out."" I still recommend it. Just put instantpot user friends on speed dial for the first week or so and find some good instantpot blogs."
1.0 out of 5 stars,"Brand new unit,  doesn't even pressurize. Passes the 'water test' for 2 cups of water but not for anything 3 cups or higher. The capacity I had bought was 6 quart so should be handle upto atleast 6 cups of food without any issues regarding pressurizing.Terrible customer support who do not respond to emails. After 10 emails and daily calls for a week agreed that the heating element in my unit wasn't working well. Instead of sending a return label so that I can send unit back they said they will just replace the bottom/outer pot. They say they are 'out of stock' and it is not even clear when I will get the replacement. Also they say I have to safely recycle the heating element/the defective inner pot, apparently they want to save costs on recycling as well.Any manufacturer once concluded that there are issues with product will send a return label especially if brand new but these shameless people do not even care."
2.0 out of 5 stars,"Alright, you crazy cult people. I joined your bandwagon. I subbed to all the videos and the reddits and the blogs. My wishlist was already lined with trivets, rings, Pyrex, tongs and egg molds. And now, a month later, it's going back.First time, spaghetti squash. I thought, spaghetti squash in 7 minutes! That's amazing! Spent more time researching conflicting cooking times on the internet than I did using the appliance, but I finally plopped in a halved squash and let it get to work. Some 45 minutes later, I had mushy, watery, overdone spaghetti squash. Good times.The IP witch coven doesn't speak of the wait time for the unit to come to pressure. Then once it's finally done, you have to tack on another component which adds at least several minutes: Pressure release. X minutes NR, y minutes QR, you mean it's not ready yet?! Factoring in this kind of crap is tedious, especially when added to the trial and error required just to achieve the right cooking time.But I already bought chicken specifically to use in this thing. So.. let's have another go.2lbs of boneless skinless chicken breast. I had gone through so many recommendations and instructions that no one seems to universally agree on, and each one varies slightly depending on several variables. Frozen or fresh? Flattened or thick? PIP or inner lid? I ended up going through the cooking cycle three different times before it was finally done throughout. When it was finally done, I had two watery chicken breasts. Even under absolutely perfect conditions, you're just getting poached chicken in the same time you could do it on the stove.Which brings me to my final attempt: Cheesecake. It was a disaster. I can't.And I don't have to. Because the damn thing broke, haha. After the cheesecake, it flashed a fatal error and I'm forced to return it. I considered an exchange, but by the time I got to that ""Refund to my card"" radio button, there was no turning back. Instant Pot, you're a poor slowcooker, a soggy baker, you're not versatile and you're just not instant."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm like lots of others in that I was kind of intimidated by the ""INSTANT"" feature of the Instant Pot.  But it also seems that this is the ""gadget du jour"" for a lot of food bloggers lately. They raved about this item and I think some of them were given one to review so I was a bit skeptical. But there was a recipe on Nom Nom Paleo that I was dying to try. And the things this pot promises to do! Slow cooker, steamer, saute, rice maker, yogurt maker (yeah like I'll ever do that in my lifetime) and of course the instant pressure cooker feature.I finally bit the bullet and ordered it and it sat in my cupboard for a good month. Images of my mother's old pressure cooker which didn't exactly EXPLODE but did leave beef stew on the ceiling, kept stopping me in my tracks as far as using it. Saute, sure. Slow Cook....sure.  Instant Cook....ummmmmmmm gimme a minute.Finally the Mexican Beef recipe (kind of Carne Guisada), kept calling my name and I set sail on the INSTANT POT sea. Armed w/ my ingredients, the Instant pot, and a couple of pounds of the most gristle filled, hard to cut grass fed beef, I girded up my loins and had at it. Well let me say that in 1 1/4 hours (including prep time), I had the MOST tender Mexican Beef I could imagine. Cooking that meat for 10 hours in the crock pot couldn't come close to the melt in your mouth Guisada that this little puppy produced. It was as easy as saute, dump in all the ingredients, hit MEAT/STEW and walk away. I'm totally psyched, can't you tell? Get this. Get this NOW!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have always been a bit leery of pressure cookers. So I meticulously read the operating manual to make sure I was doing everything correctly. While the manual was easy to follow, it didn’t necessarily match up with my 3Qt Duo Mini. A quick search online brought up a few helpful blogs to get me up and running so that I was confident I wasn’t going to destroy anything or hurt myself.After going through the initial set-up process, I decided to jump in by cooking frozen chicken breasts. Two large breasts fit just right into the 3Qt pot. I added chicken broth and seasoning, and then I waited. The process was simple and very quick considering that the chicken came straight from the freezer. It was juicy but could have used more seasoning. I plan to try using the Instant Pot again tomorrow with another frozen protein. This definitely takes the stress away from remembering to thaw meat the night before.Overall, I’m quite pleased with this new tool. As other reviewers noted, it’s heavy for a small appliance, but the foot-print will be good in our RV."
1.0 out of 5 stars,"I was so excited to get this Instant Pot. The problem is that it would work sometimes and other times the steam would come out the sides of the lid. Because of that, the error message would come on and my food was burned. To say the least, I am very disappointed."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I thought that the lid had to be secured to the pot as the original. Mine didn't so I called instapot and they told me there's no twist/securing mechanism, it just sits on the pot. It doesn't use pressure so its not necessary to twixt. Just sit it on top. It worked great and is amazing. 2 notes: the instructions are not clear that it doesn't need to be secure and whatever your cook time is, it stops half way so you can add additional items, then replace the lid. I would hope that instapot people would add that info in future in the instruction guide. If you take it off and replace it within 3 mins, your cooking time continues, otherwise reset for the remaining time. That's a cool feature. Iove the instapot!!"
4.0 out of 5 stars,"We use this soo much, it’s silly.Don’t expect it to be a fabulous rice cooker though, read till end for why...Does a great job for meats, roasts, and similar.Slow cooker settings seem silly, unless you’ll be away for a while. We use pressure setting 99.99% of time.One import thing to note, when timer beeps, if you manually vent, put it somewhere where the venting steam can dissipate (ideally not under a cabinet, it may steam-damage your furniture/cabs).Also, letting it self-vent and unlock by cool-down ensures your pork-roast isn’t still stringy and is super tender; it really needs that extra few minutes (as silly as it sounds).Lastly AND MOST IMPORTANT -It does “ok” with brown rice, but white rice or sushi rice, it always comes out too wet and soggy; the recommended water amount isn’t broken up by rice type, and you’re likely to mess it up several times before you experiment to get it right.Also, I found for white and sushi rice, it’s just as fast to do it stovetop in a pot, as there’s no waiting for the cooker to come up to pressure, and no waiting for it to vent (remember, force-venting still isn’t done yet).Otherwise it’s out on the counter often.Very easy to clean if you don’t spill stuff all over it.  The pot liner removes easily, and the lid can be wiped off (almost never has splatter or other — and the lid gasket easily removes for a quick hand-wash (do not out the gasket in dishwasher, it’ll harden and brittle from detergents and heat)."
1.0 out of 5 stars,"HUGE dent in the outer casing straight out of the box -- the stainless steel used here is pop-can thin and can be easily bent with a fingertip. Was able to pull the dent out with a suction cup, but small signs of damage remain and it clearly will be prone to this sort of thing happening over and over with any sort of normal use. Given the heavy weight an 8-quart cooker might be expected to contain, this sort of flimsy construction is not at all acceptable. A shame, as I was looking forward to using this."
5.0 out of 5 stars,The only thing I've disliked about the instant pot was that you could never have crisp skin on chicken. With the Air Fryer lid I can now cook frozen wings in the instant pot and then air fry them to perfection in a total of 30 minutes. I haven't tried anything else yet but that function alone is worth it to me.
4.0 out of 5 stars,"Update (from 1 to 4 stars) So a week later, my new pot arrived (not smashed and correct size). After having used it for about 2 months,  here is what I like and dont like about it:Pro’s:-Good size (it is perfect for our small family of 3) probably too small if your family is 4 and above and especially if you like to store food for later/ tomorrow. The one I received first was the bigger one and my god it was massive, i would not know where to keep it if I kept it.-easy to use - the pre set program is easy to follow. I mostly use the Pressure Cook & stew and broth functions - just chop up everything, close the lid, press the button and thats it. It makes really earthy, wholesome soups, broth and stews! I made russian borsh, hungarian goulash and irish stew... turned out just as good as you buy at restaurants.-nice and sturdy - the lid has a good weight to it and it does not feel like it is going to explode in any minute.-great value - for about 60 quid this is a bargain. I ve seen there are smarter ones like you connect it to your phone and leave it be and all that but this is good enough for me!-inner pot is great - it is anti stick and washes off quite easily - even boiled milk which leaves a very sticky bottom that is hard to get rid of.Cons:-the only negative is the aftersmell. I tried using vinegar, baking soda etc but the smell is still there. But i can live with it.Overall I am very happy with this pot! It is one of my kitchen staples!First review:Okay, so they clearly sent me an open-box, damaged instant pot... i ordered the 6 quart one but they sent me the larger one.Also the side of it was badly smashed and looked terrible. I returned it straight away.It seems like they sent me a used/open box one. I was able to return it etc but the extra hassle was not what I needed."
1.0 out of 5 stars,Do not buy it. Waste your money. Only work for a month. No warranty too.
1.0 out of 5 stars,"At about 40 days from delivery. Thought float valve might be a cleaning problem but NO. Took it apart to clean valve and saw that valve has a burr on it and that burr had scored the sleeve it rides up in. Valve will not ride up completely and won't seal pot. When it won't close, you get the burn error on the front panel. Went to IP support site but they're saying there will be a delay in responding. Now I guess I have an expensive slow cooker. Very disappointed. Checked several places on the net and there are a lot of problems with the series 3 IP duo reporting the ""burn"" error..If you're getting a ""burn"" error, please check the float valve for burr and sleeve for scars. Hey Amazon, you want to step up here and fix this.."
3.0 out of 5 stars,"I like this attachment because it’s an attachment to something we already own. Unfortunately that’s also the downside. The basket that comes with this attachment gives you an inch less room in the Instapot which means less cooking surface. I am estimating about 8-10 inches across. If you want to do a big batch of food you have to do it multiple times which is a pain.Essentially when you purchase an air fryer, you are buying a convection oven. If I could do it over again I would purchase a stand alone convection oven for $200. It’s a little more but you have more options to cook things and you can cook more of the food you want at a single time."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I guess like everyone else, you either love this appliance or hate it.  I have a six quart stove top pressure cooker that I never remember to use, as it requires I stand there and watch it for most of the process.  This sweet new appliance seals, comes to pressure, cooks for the allotted time, and then keeps the meal warm and brings down the pressure all by itself.  I can set it and forget it.  Love the six quart size and the inner stainless steel pot cleans up nicely.  Be aware, this is a pressure cooker.  You are not going to get stir fried veg from this, but inexpensive cuts of meat and legumes will be perfectly cooked.  It does a bang up job on rice and I was so pleased to be able to cook dried beans and have them come out soft and tender.  I am using it at least once a week now, and have used it more in a couple of months than I ever used my stove top pan in the entire time I owned it.  My next venture will be potato salad cooking the eggs and potatoes all at the same time.  Sweet.  There are tons of ideas and recipes on the internet for this, which you will need, as the instruction booklet and recipe booklet leave much to be desired.If you see some mineral deposits develop on the stainless steel inner pot, just put some water and a little cream of tarter in and put the appliance on simmer.  It will disappear and look as good as new.  The exterior wipes clean easily and so does the lid.  The seal does seem to retain odors, but I store mine with some crumpled up newspaper inside, and that seems to absorb the odors.  They do not affect the end product anyway.I think if you cook in large quantities, want to speed things up, and are not looking for ""crisp"" vegetables, you will be thrilled with this appliance"
3.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought one of these in January just after x-mas.  It worked great the first three times, then would not seal.  It ended up either burning the food or steam cooking it.  I went through all the troubleshooting steps and still no luck.  I figured I got a defective one, so I exchanged it for another one.  This one worked for the water test, then a made a beef stew and it turned out awesome.  The next time I tried it, not so awesome.  The same issue started happening, not sealing.  I thought perhaps I had the ring on incorrectly, because surely I couldn't have been sent another defective product.  Nope, still cant get it to work.  So disappointed because that first batch of beef stew was memorable.  Tried contacting customer service with no luck yet.  I am now past the return date on my second instant pot and I'm stuck with this piece of junk.  I suppose I will try a different brand because I really liked the results of pressure cooking when it did work.  Don't buy this model.  I wish I had read the reviews before I did my exchange.  Lesson learned. (Big Sigh!)Update July 17, 2020:I got my second one to work. I figure out that it will only seal if I don't use the manual setting. Instead I use a preset setting and then adjust the time from there. So far so good. I’ve used it this way a handful of times with no issues so far. Now I wonder if the first one I had would have worked the same.  I still recommend a different model that works the way it’s intended to."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I absolutely love this.  I cook 3 meals in the kitchen every day plus snacks.  I have been wanting one for over a year since it has great reviews and safe materials but I was nervous about it exploding because of the pressure. When I finally bought one I didn't use it for a few days because I was scared.  After that first meal though I haven't stopped.  I use it every day.  It has helped me out in the kitchen so much.  It reduces cook times and the amount of dishes I have to do.  I don't have to give it all of my attention like other appliances.  I can take care of the kids while it cooks the meals.  It makes whole chickens in 45 minutes, bone broth in 2 hours, and chili in 40 minutes.  Our first meal was frozen chicken breasts with potatoes, celery, and carrots and it only took 8 minutes.  I don't have to thaw things out anymore or plan ahead.  The pan is really easy to clean out. If it gets anything stuck to the bottom I turn it on saute with water and baking soda and it comes right off.  I don't enjoy dishes so its really helpful to have something that doesn't add more stress in the kitchen.  Eggs and rice come out perfect every time.  I got rid of our rice cooker and crock pot and love having less stuff in the kitchen.If you need to cook lots of meals at home for your budget or allergies, get one of these!"
1.0 out of 5 stars,"I have used the pot for several months without a problem. But recently it intermittently leak when pressure increases. Since we use delay timer to do the cooking during the night, we don't know exactly where the leak is. And again, it happens intermittently but the frequency is increasing. Since it is still under warranty, i called the customer service today and experienced the most horrible service. The lady ask me to shoot a 5 mins video for her to catch the leaking. But I told her the leak doesnot happen everytime, and what if the time i shoot the video there is no leaking. She said and i quote: then your pot is fine, i cannot replace anything for you.In her mind, i have to stand by the pot everytime during the cooking hoping the leak will happen. it could happen the first time, it could happen the 100th time. And it seems in her mind my time is worthless and i dont have anything to do but watching for the stupid pot. How ridiculous is that! All she should do is just mail me a small rubber ring and she even refuse to do that.I have never see a company who treat their customer like this. I feel so humiliated. Please stay away from them."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"1st time I heard Pressure Cooker was several weeks ago from one of my co-workers and she told me she can use it to cook so many different kind of delicious food. Easy and fast. Although I have no idea what is Pressure Cooker but I told myself immediately, I want one! I have so many expensive kitchen appliance at home but I don't have a Pressure Cooker. Is it really that good? I started doing lot of research on Pressure cooker and decided to get this one. 1) lots of good review; 2) good brand; 3) List as 1st rank for 10 best pressure cookers for 2019; 4) Reasonable price.I received it a week ago. I love it. Nice design, good quality, easy to use and clean, clear/large display, multifunctional. I used it right the way. I cooked mix quinoa/wild rice/oats for my dog. It usually takes 45 mins with a rice cooker but I only used 8 mins with instant pot. But I made a mistake, I wanted to cook a little bit longer and I closed the lid and push for cooking additional 2 mins without adding some water. The cooker alarmed me right the way ""burned food"" on the display with clear beep sound that I can hear from living room. When I checked food I noticed it was little bit burned in the bottom. I was worried that I probably have to threw away the inner pot because will be difficult to clean it. However, when I clean it next day. It was so easy to clean and removed all the burned spots. It looks like new after I washed it. I am really expressed. I haven't had chance to use it to cook different meals yet but I will try in the next few days. Perhaps give an updated review later. So far is good and I recommend this product to others."
5.0 out of 5 stars,This is by far one of the best investments I’ve made.. I’ve made some of the yummiest soups ever and it’s so easy!! The only thing I wish was a little different is the steam release valve. It’s a bit intense and the steam is so hot the little droplets can burn. But it is definitely not a deal breaker and I absolutely love love love this insta pot. Excited to learn how to make more things like yogurt!
3.0 out of 5 stars,"I am glad that Ibstant Pot made this lid. I give the lid 5 stars. I have been using it a lot! However,  I just think that  they should have an option for a stainless steel air fryer basket. I don't use non- stick coated cookware in my home, so I will have to make do with a stainless steel steamer basket."
2.0 out of 5 stars,I like the pot but have some issues with the company. Was on hold with them for 25 minutes yesterday before I finally hung up. I have emailed them and gotten no response yet. I was supposed to get (per their booklet) an extra plastic seal but did not. I would love to get the extra one and then can change my overall rating. I have never used an insta pot before but this one did a great job tonight on our dinner. Took an hour but made a great mexican casserole with no extra pots to clean--Yay!
4.0 out of 5 stars,"Heard from several people how useful InstaPots were.  So, I decided to give them a try.  This one has the basic options I need.  It is also the right size for 4 people, which is what I was looking for.  I will say that it has taken some getting used to, but I think it is primarily due to never have used a pressure cooker before.  Unlike my expectation, no, dishes are not ready in 10 minutes.  However, cooking time is reduced by 1/2 to 1/3 vs traditional cooking.  Once you know this, you know how long to allow for.  I also like that you can pretty much do all steps of the dish in the same pot.  No need to dirty more dishes.  In terms of how food taste, I've have mixed results...some very good, some not so much.  I'm hoping this continues to improve as I learn how to best use this new tool.  Overall, I'm glad I got it."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"This works well.  In particular, it's the best brown rice cooker I've ever used.  It's easy to set up, easy to use, and easy to clean.  All of the parts seem sturdily constructed.  For example, the cook bowl is heavy gauge stainless steel.  The cord is a little short (about 1 meter).  However, it uses a standard ""computer cord"" (IEC C13), so I can easily replace it with a longer one.  It came with a decent instruction manual, and several cookbooks specific to it are available on Amazon.My biggest annoyance is the cook times are ""spun"", ie marketing adjusted them to sound shorter than they actually are.  They do not include heat up, and cool down times.  You have to wait for it to come up to temperature and pressure, before the cook cycle.  After it's cooked, you can release the pressure ""quickly"" or ""naturally"".  Most recipes specify ""natural"", which means the food has to cool down enough for the internal pressure to fall, and the float vent to drop down.  In the case of one cup of brown rice, this increases the 25 minute official ""cook time"" by about 10 minutes to heat up, and another 10 minutes to cool down.  So a ""25 minute"" recipe actually takes about 45.  The recipe book I bought starts most of the instructions with ""preheat the cooker on saute..."".  The instructions that came with it never mention this startup time.A second, very minor annoyance is that you can't see into the pot while cooking.  This is reasonable, since glass would severely weaken the lid.  I would be terrified of a glass lid exploding in my face."

5.0 out of 5 stars,"Yes! This attachment is awesome. I use it to air fry with or without using the pressure cooker first. My first recipe attempt was Spinach pie and it was ridiculously good. So flakey and crispy! Perfectly cooked even with using both levels. I really like that this kid can be stored separately- unlike the Ninja that keeps it attached and was way too big more my cabinet tops. I use my Instant Pot all the time and now it is even more versatile. So glad I didn’t buy a separate Air fryer. The lid is nice and heavy/sturdy but not unwieldy. It has its own controls that are really easy to use. I love that it remembers my last setting so I can just hit go again! Basically I cut the cooking time in half, flip the items, spray them with oil, place the lid back and start once again! Seriously 10/10 easy to use."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"Was wishing for an Air Fryer when I spotted this Air Fryer Lid to be used with my 6 qt Instant Pot. It's great! Granted the Instant Pot is not as big as a regular Air Fryer, but there is just the two of us so It's plenty big enough.  It comes with a non stick basket to be placed inside the Instant Pot and the Air Fryer Lid simply replaces the pressure cooker lid of the Instant Pot and turns it into an Air Fryer. It also comes with a protective pad/storage cover.  The controls on top of the Lid are simple to understand since the Instant Pot and Air Fryer Lid CANNOT be plugged in at the same time, the safety feature of the Air Fryer Lid plug is genius! My only gripe is the stainless steel broiling tray that is supposed to turn the Air Fryer Basket into a multi level basket. Ugh. Horrible. Hence the 4 stars for Ease of Use. It simply does not stay in place. Falls to the bottom of the basket and if you are trying to use 2 levels of air frying, it's nearly impossible to lift the try out of the basket. I wound up buying multilevel stacking dehydrating trays to use instead. More expense, but problem solved. That being said....would I buy it again? Probably, because I do not have the space for a separate Air Fryer and Instant Pot. The Air Fryer Lid is much easier to store. If you have endless counter space, get a regular Air Fryer. But for small spaces, this Air Fryer Lid does the trick. Buyer beware as it is not compatible with all Instant Pot models."
5.0 out of 5 stars,Got this after using my moms ninja food air fryer.  Thought this was a great add on without having to buy a whole new product.  We all ready had the instant pot.  My first run was with tater tots and they turned out amazing.  Then I got a tip to make a hamburger by putting foil under the basket when air frying it and that was great for collecting the grease but cleaning the basket was a nightmare.  I scrubbed gently but still food was stuck on so I did the top rack dish washer. When I took it out it had chips in the basket and it was still dirty.  I would love a replacement basket that I can use one for my husbands meat which would be the one with the chips and another clean one for my vegetarian meals.  Can’t find a replacement basket though.  I do love this add on though if you have the instant pot.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"so far I am impressed by how meat and chicken turn out in this pot. Specially if you are following a recipe tailored to the pot. Boiled eggs turned out good too. I am still to master steaming veggies, my carrots were over cooked, need less time next try. Squash soup was quick. Rice is better on the stove for me. I cook Jasmine but I bet brown and wild rice would be better. I usually use canned beans, but interested to try to cook beans in it. I bet a chilli recipe from scratch would turn out great. So as you can see many possibilities to explore."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"OK, so, like everyone, I've been hearing alot about these Instant Pots...as in lots of rave reviews.I got this on a ridiculous Black Friday deal, and saved it for a Christmas present for my girlfriend.Last year, I gave her a way beyond and over the top complete set of Ninja Blender stuff, and as she opened each separately wrapped piece, her expression and mood got worse and finally, she literally stopped opening and left the room.  3 weeks later, after using it, her mood changed abruptly and it's now a go to kitchen appliance.So this year, things were pretty much the same (as I also bought and wrapped a few extras for this), as in she wasn't very happy.Last weekend, I asked her if I could use it...and also asked that she watch and see just how awesome this thing is.  She agreed, and I proceeded to check for recipes for BBQ Baked beans from scratch.  Let's just say we were both impressed beyond expectations and I'm now waiting for her to use this on her own.I went for the 8 quart size because I truly believe bigger is better and offers more options.  It's just me and the girlfriend, but when I/we cook, we like having extra, which we freeze with our FoodSaver in 1-2 portion bags.  This is a large machine, but I'm happy I went big, as it opens up so many more options for cooking.As a pressure cooker, I'm still amazed how easy it is to use and how great the results are.  I mean, instead of soaking my beans overnight, changing water several times, and then having to slow cook them the entire next day, I had my beans completely done in less than 2 hours from start to finish, and there are actually recipes that can be completed in half that time.  I've read and seen frozen, raw meat being cooked to what appears to be perfection in less than 30 minutes.  Crazy cool.Another reason I went for this (and went big) was the slow cooker functions.  We have 2 crock pots and neither one works like I'd like it to.  The lids never fit remotely tight, steam and whatever we're cooking spits out constantly, and getting the thing up to real heat takes well over an hour.  Here, with the Instant Pot, you can first of all sear your meat or saute your vegies in mere minutes, as in you have real, serious heat faster than an electric range!  And then, simply change the heat to slow cooker put on your nicely fitting glass lid (you'll have to purchase that separately, though), and crock pot away.  You can even use a ""keep warm"" setting and let peeps serve themselves from your kitchen island.Again, I got this for the insane price of $69, and it's now showing at $122, but I'm telling you, this thing is worth its weight in gold and can replace so many kitchen appliances.  Time is not an enemy of mine, yet I foresee using this very often.  If time isn't on your side, you'll find you can cook amazing meals in a mere fraction of the time it would take you using standard appliances.This is truly an A+ appliance and a must in every kitchen."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought this as a gift for my friend for Xmas last year (2017). This instant pot /lives/ on their counter, because they use it so frequently. They have a small kitchen, so no room for a rice cooker, a slow cooker, and a pressure cooker. For their cooking needs, it does a mighty fine job. So why did I ding 1 star off? Because the sautee function is NOT a searing function at all. It gets the thing hot enough to sweat your aromatics, but not properly get a solid sear going on them. Same goes for whole spices. If that heat got hot enough as it claims to do, I could pop whole spices. I cannot. This will not replace a stove and some good pots.Instead, treat it as a simple cooking tool. You can chuck something in there that takes forever to cook, and go ahead and sort out your spices, onions, garlic, etc on the actual stove. Once the long-cooking thing is done cooking, combine with the stuff on the stove, and you're good to go.One more thing. I will STRONGLY suggest that you do not start this with cold water. It will take forever and a day to get up to full pressure. Remember what I said about the sautee function being garbage? The same goes for boiling water. You start this guy off with cold water, and you'll be starving long before you hit full pressure. Instead, I'll suggest that you have an electric kettle on hand to have some good boiling water on hand to tip into the pressure cooker, and then you'll ""only"" wait like 8 or so minutes to hit full pressure.Personally, I think this whole Instapot thing is a cult, and y'all don't know any better, because you've not used a real stove top pressure cooker. For the people that have bought into the cult, however, it is a life-saver. There's ladies at the office to whom I've suggested this device, and 100% of them swear by it now.I'll stick to my Hawkins and the stove, but if you're not an avid cook, this is perfect for you."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"we bought the small size because there are two of us.When cooking rice, I can always get good (not great) rice, brown or white. It's not quite as fluffy as our old rice cooker, but it is far more reliable, and much easier to clean up. It takes me an hour to make good rice - 10 minutes pressure cooking and 50 minutes Keep Warm standing.I've also used it for slow-cooking pork loins. It would also work for ribs. It takes about 12-16 hours until the meat is fall-apart tender, yet still has some flavor. The pot does a great job of holding the temp right around 170 degrees. Pour on a little bar-b-que sauce, turn the meat (1 or two pieces) once in a while, and forget about it.Easy to clean and reliable (6 months in).(And clean, don't forget CLEAN. Easy to clean is key around this household!)"

5.0 out of 5 stars,"What a wonderful appliance!  It is now no longer a problem if you ever forget to take what you've planned for dinner out of the freezer. There are so many other users on line, you could have a different recipe every day of the rest of your life - and I haven't experienced a less than wonderful one yet!  The little clear plastic box that collects the moisture that drips from the pot as it's cooking keeps falling off.  Perhaps I am clumsy.  It goes on tight enough, it just comes off really easily.  Be sure and get a second inner pot when you can.  It's very handy.  Get the package of extra sealing gaskets of two different colors too.  Use one for savory and the other for sweet foods because they do absorb the odors.  Dinner is so easy - put whatever in the pot to cook and throw together salad, set the table and voila! Dinner is done - no standing over a hot stove between running back and forth to set the table and making the salad."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"First off—I LOVE having an Instant Pot. It really is a game changer in the kitchen. If you're deciding between the smaller one or this, go with this 8-QT—so much more versatility to cook larger items like a whole chicken or big batch of soup.That said, there are a few things I'd change about this particular model.1. The seal absorbs smells and stinks. I use this to make bone broth and the seal is like permeated with the smell. It's kind of repulsive. I'd recommend getting two seals if you're going to do something like that so that you don't have to smell it.2. The release valve takes forever to let the pressure out. It's so dang slow. I thought mine was defective, but my friend has the same one and experiences the same thing. It seems like the 6 QT one release pressure much faster. So you have to add on an extra 10 minutes at least just to let the pressure out.3. Takes a long time to get up to pressure. Again, add another 15-30 minutes on top of cook time to get up to pressure. Kind of defeats the purpose of this being ""instant"", but for things that would normally take hours, its still great."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm new to pressure cooking so I was more than a little intimidated about using it.  I found the package directions to be not very useful for someone who doesn't know what they're doing, but there are lots of helpful videos and blogs online.  I've only made a few dishes so far, but the baby back ribs were outstanding and so much easier than waiting hours for them to cook in the oven or on the grill.  People in the Instant Pot Community have provided lots of meal ideas.  There are many accessories on Amazon such as egg stands and spring ring forms for cheesecake.  I am going to try a cheesecake next."
1.0 out of 5 stars,So I used my instant pot about a dozen times and was finally getting comfortable with it when no matter what I did I got a LID error. I called in and the Rep was super friendly and said it was an electronics error but not to worry as they would take care of it. She asked that I send various pics and I did so. Then I receive an email from a different rep that unfortunately they don’t ship for free to Hawaii. Uhm Amazon sure did. I asked what the shipping charge would be. The response 126.00 lol but luckily for me they would pay 50 % so for the rock bottom price of nearly 70.00 they would replace my 99.00 purchase that broke because of an acknowledged manufacturing failure . How generous . I like the instant pot but be aware that if you are in Hawaii or Alaska and yours breaks this will happen to you. I can’t bring myself to to pay the shipping so I’m going with another manufacturer that values their customers.
3.0 out of 5 stars,"Love my Instant Pot Duo Mini except the silicone seal on the lid.  Why does this require so much cleaning to try and keep the cooking smells out of it?  It is all over the internet about this.  You should not have to spend so much time soaking or steaming the liner to keep it from smelling.  This is a serious fault and the company really needs to fix this issue.  Now cooking in it for one or two is great (remember I have the mini).  I make yogurt, stews, flan, lemon curd, and so on without a problem.  Still use traditional pots for some things of course, but this pot is very efficient and the inner pot is very easy to clean.So maker of the Instant Pot, get us all a seal that does not absorb the smell of whatever you are cooking.  This is a ridiculous product fault."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"I recommend this if you are a single person who does not love leftovers, or are cooking in many small batches.  When we first tried using this we kept getting a burn error.  The information in the guidebooks was mostly unhelpful, stating that the message appeared when there was food stuck to the bottom of the pot.  The burn message completely prevents you from continuing to cook, so it can be a major problem. What would have been helpful to know is that each IP has a requirement for a certain amount of water, not just liquid.  Tomato dishes WILL burn in this size if you do not have enough water and that can be difficult to achieve with a pot this size.  Although we did not like this size, we have since upgraded to an 8 quart and we love it.  All my stars go to Instant Pot products, but this size didn't even come close to working for us."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"It's a great kitchen appliance and makes meals simple and easy especially with big gatherings. Easy to use and there are literally hundreds of recipes that you can use to make almost any food. I'm giving it 4 stars due to the fact that the silicone sealing ring is it's biggest flaw. It holds food odors and it is impossible to get them out. I've read many suggestions on how to get rid of the smell however none worked. I used the cooker many times and decided to try sausage & peppers, that was the one and only dish that held the smell. It is so bad that I had to order replacement rings. Just having the sealing ring sitting out on the drying rack after many attempts of cleaning it makes the kitchen smell really bad. I now have placed it outside because its so bad. I will bag it and only use it for sausage & peppers again. Waiting on my new rings which are 2, one for sweet and one for savory."
2.0 out of 5 stars,"Last months Prime Day price was too good to pass up, so after watching, waiting & pondering, I dove in and purchased an Instant Pot. I've watched countless videos on youtube and pored over just as many recipes and they all make it look 100% foolproof - my experience, however, has been far from that. Like many, I waited a couple weeks after receiving my IP to work up the nerve to use it, but after all the hype, what could go wrong? The initial water test went fine. Moved on to boiled eggs; seemed to go well until it switched over to count down & 'burn' warning flashed - added more water and worked. Next day attempted a package of bagged, frozen Chicken thighs - all seemed well, but when it got up to 'pressure', the display flickered & flashed 'burn' - ? Did quick release, added more liquid, and then all went well. Tried a bag of frozen chicken breasts, following day and experienced same 'burn' message 2 times before finally worked. Over the next couple days, made yogurt & steel cut oats - both 'worked' and came out well, though the yogurt did not come up to initial temp w/first try; had to use saute setting to get it there. Did another water test last night to make sure the pot was actually 'ok' and not faulty, and after it sealed/reached pressure, steam began shooting out of release knob/handle just like during a quick release. Tried again, same thing. Ended up calling Instant pot's help line and tech told me to attempt with 3 cups of water; I did & all went perfect. *In the 100's of vids I've watched or read almost every single one calls for '1 cup' of water/liquid - this has not worked ONCE for me and it is beyond frustrating. If the pot is going to require 3 or more cups of liquid, I might as well boil the food in a pot on the stove. I am a fairly accomplished cook ,but this device has tried my patience like nothing else. It has not been 'Instant' nor easy. Not happy & very disappointed."
3.0 out of 5 stars,"I started to notice that everytime I started to cook something in it I would get the Food Burn warning lite. I checked the manual it says that this warning will come on when the pot senses food is burning and lowers the heat of the pot. Well that's all fine and dandy but it was happening every time I tried to use the pot. The last two times the pot would not seal and steam would blow out constantly so pressure would not build up.  When I first started the return process Amazon wanted me to contact the manufacturer.  I tried calling the manufacturer and got a message saying they were not open and to contact them during regular business hours.  I then went back on Amazon and started the return process again and I was allowed to go ahead and start the return process.  I have to say, that I printed up the shipping label put the pot back in the box, took it to the local UPS Store, before I got home Amazon had already sent an email stating that the product had been returned and my account had been credited.  THAT, My friends is awesome service.  I will most likely buy another instapot from Amazon, as I know they are a good product, my neighbor swears by hers, and we both started out with pots by another manufacturer they both worked great but the finish inside the Pot itself started to flake off so we both figured Instapots Stainless Steel Pot was the way to go.  I Just hope that I don't have another bad experience with the next Instapot.  We will see."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"My wife and I used to hate cooking, mostly because of all of the time and effort it took to cook different dishes. Using different pots and pans (and then cleaning them afterwards) was a big headache.We heard good things about the Instant Pot and so we gave it a try. We love it! It is now our go-to appliance for steaming vegetables for most meals. The ""set it and forget it"" style of Instant Pot is such a relief after years of steaming vegetables in a pan or wok on the stovetop and keeping a close eye on it. Using the Instant Pot also frees up space on the stovetop for other cooking. We have also tried stewing, sauté, but we definitely use the steam function most often. Instant Pot is amazing! And it's now an indispensable part of our cooking lives."
1.0 out of 5 stars,"The handle broke off while I was putting the Instant Pot away. I have only used it a few times and owned it for just a couple of months, so it's not getting excessive use. It seems like a design flaw to me. I have contacted Instant Pot customer service multiple times to see if it's still usable -- I'm concerned that if the break is structural, it may make it unsafe to use the pressure cooker feature -- and no one has gotten back to me. All in all, a very disappointing experience from both a product and service perspective.If you are in the market for something to make cooking easier, I would recommend looking for a better quality product, sold by a company that stands by what they sell."
2.0 out of 5 stars,"I might change my review if the replacement one I get isn't faulty also... I have a larger 6qt duo and wanted to buy a smaller one for side dishes. This thing definitely had more burn notices than my other one but I just let it go. Used it a few times for rice and a couple other things on the side. Today I went to use it, got a burn notice and when I took out the inner pot it was SO burnt on the bottom.. looking inside I noticed part of the heating element was now exposed and was melting away the plastic part that sits on top of it... really hope it was just a fluke. But seriously, how dangerous is that?!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"It's hot where I live.  I don't want to fire up my oven to bake my tots in the summer.  This lid has changed all of that.  It takes 15 minutes to bake my tots to crispy deliciousness and it doesn't make my kitchen hot!Score!A couple things:  be careful.  Make sure the ""protective pad"" is attached securely before you pick it up.  If it falls on you foot, it hurts. Seriously.The plug in is annoying.  If you have something plugged into the plug you want to use, you have to unplug it. I almost broke my coffee carafe.  Be careful!Otherwise, this lid makes my instant pot even more versatile.  Don't hesitate.  Buy it."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"So I have two Instant Pots and am looking into the Omni Toaster Oven and more, but I have had an air fryer in the past that was to me a total waste of money so I was a bit worried about spending the money on an item I was unsure would work.  THIS IS AMAZING!! I cannot say enough about Instant Pot products and I recommend them to everyone I know! This lid is SO easy to use and it does what no air fryer I have seen do...it ACTUALLY GETS THINGS CRISPY!! Other than the amount of food you can cook is limited to your instant pot size this thing is worth every single penny. We use it all the time and I have not had one bad experience with it. YOU NEED THIS...trust me!!"
2.0 out of 5 stars,"Pot worked well for a couple of months.  Then, while cleaning, a light bump against the pot body and the steam release button popped off.  This is held in place by light plastic around a small screw.  Called Instant Pot customer service.  After waiting on hold for 30+ minutes I was told that the only solution is to replace the entire lid for about $50.  All the other lid parts are readily available except for the most fragile part.  Break that, and you're buying a new appliance as the cost of the lid is essentially the cost of a new Instant Pot.  Not really very happy with this."
3.0 out of 5 stars,I have been very happy with the way this cooks.  It makes zero noise except when releasing steam.  I was blown away to see high quality enamel around the top on the inside where you so often see teflon.I had a very bad experience with the stainless pot (I don't know if it was the one that came with in the cooker or the spare I bought from same company) but the stainless steel pitted the first few uses and I had to exchange for a new one that has functioned without issue.The irony is that I bought this because of the stainless steel.  I don't like using non-stick surfaces because they wear and you end up eating the teflon.  Now it appears I have eaten stainless steel instead!!I expect this was a fluke and I expect to be happy with this product but I am disappointed that having now received the defective product and had a chance to assess the issue no one has contacted me to offer a refund.  As is clear in the photos... this was a major fail and who knows what has gotten into my system as a result.
3.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought this Instant Pot last November and I LOVELOVELOVE it, it has changed my life, i use almost all the functions. It's a wonderful device!!!!BUT. The Pot has evidently a design flaw, maybe the type of plastic, maybe the manufacturing process, I don't know, that causes the lid to melt right at the back pressure lock. I see that many people have complained of this, thinking that they themselves caused it by setting the lid down on the stove or whatever. None of that applies to me! Mine is not near my stove and I haven't set it down on a hot object. This is obviously a design flow on the part of Instant Pot. I hope they fix it!!! See the pictures of where the thing melted, and I can't close the lid to seal it now.Problem #2 is, they are totally out of stock with replacement lids. To boot, the replacement lids are $66.00, a brand new unit is $79 or so!!! I'll buy another one because I love it, and have invested in many accessories, a second stainless steel pot, spare sealing gaskets, you name it, so i don't want to try a different brand. But really! That's an outrageous price!!! I believe they should replace my lid, and fix their problem, I've contacted them but haven't heard back yet. If I find satisfaction, I'll report back here.The other flaw in this appliance is the slow cooker function doesn't work well. I thought I'd be able to give my Crock Pot away and make my carnitas with the Instant Pot!!! But the Instant Pot slow cooker function doesn't get up to the temperature to cook the meat, even on the high setting. All it does is just keep it warmer than the warm, but not as hot as the saute. LOL. So I still have to Crock Pot the carnitas, but use my beloved Instant Pot's other functions, ALL of them, which work wonderfully!Very sorry to report these unfortunate flaws because I really love my Instant Pot!!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my first electric pressure cooker, my others are stove top. I actually bought it because of a story I saw on Facebook about a woman getting burned when it ""blew up"". I had to find out how that could happen. I am not new to pressure cookers or how they work. So I do know that in certain circumstances it can happen. But usually because of human error.First off - you have got to clean EVERY part on the lid after each use. That means taking out the ring, taking apart the rest of the lid pieces and washing all the holes. I use a thick pipe cleaner. Food and oils can build up and block the holes and that is not good. Lightly oil your rubber gasket after each use then wipe it dry with a paper towel to get off any extra.Do NOT over fill the cooker. Those guide lines on the side are there for your protection. If you over fill it can cause food to clog the vents and that is never good.This has a lot of safety features and what she said happened in the story just could not have happened the way she said.The most dangerous part of this pressure pot is the steam release and if you are not paying attention you will get hurt. When you open the steam release put a towel over your hand and keep your face away. That steam comes out fast and hot and you will get scalded if you have your face over it. turn the knob from below the steam hole and never over the top. It's not a toy but it can be so much fun if you do it right.I figure what happened to that lady is she released the vent with her face there and she just did not want to admit she made a mistake. She said she let it stand for 40 minutes to cool, the steam vent had dropped and no steam came out the release and when she took the lid off it was still under pressure.It has a safety that does not allow the lid to come off under pressure. After 40 minutes it should have been cooled down enough, the other possibility is she filled it too full and it stuck the valve shut so it looked like the pot had cooled enough. But she also said she released the steam release and nothing came out.It has a pretty good instruction book. Facebook has some good groups that are dedicated to pressure pots and you can get a lot of information there. There are also websites but I found some of the facebook sites faster for asking point blank questions.All in all, I think this is a very good unit and I use it a lot and really enjoy it. Still can't bring myself to turn it on and leave the house all day - but I don't trust my crock pot either, lol.I think it is money well spent just for the ease of preparation and not having to slave over the stove for hours and things get done faster. Pay attention to the steam release and you are ok."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is a winner at the $52 price point I got it for in November 2017.  I tend now to spend too much time cooking because it is just fun and satisfying to achieve so much in one pot. I also turn out too many calories... again because it is fun and so easy to clean up. I am still in the learning and experimenting phase, but have made some incredible soups just using up meats from the freezer and grains from the cupboards.  Today I made country ribs with homemade bbq sauce, all in the pot, from browning the meat and the onions, stirring up a bbq sauce from scratch. It turned out so perfectly I may never again waste money at a rib shack, where the chance of getting dried up ribs is pretty high. The 3 qt size works well for one person with leftovers for 1-2 more meals, or with soups, to freeze a couple of pints in addition to eating all you want for a couple of days. Sauteing is a little tricky because the bottom of the pan is slightly convex, so if you use only a small quantity of oil, it goes to the edges leaving the center without oil. I will shop for silicone grip pot holders that pinch in order to manage the hot stainless pot for tasks like stabilizing while stirring, and draining the extra oil needed before progressing from saute to pressure mode."
3.0 out of 5 stars,"I am only writing this review based on first impressions. I read the entire getting started and safety, maintenance, warranty manuals to find out that my instant pot 60 duo plus is to arrive with an extra sealing ring but it does not. Only one sealing ring is provided that is already placed in the lid. Also, after reading the manual, I was looking at the photos on here and on youtube to realize that the buttons are different from mine. This model has a sous vide button where in photos and videos the pressure cook is located. See my photo to see all the buttons. Compare the photos and videos online for this model and on this amazon page to my photo to see the difference. Can anyone explain this to me? I have yet to use it as I am afraid that this is not the real item?  My item is not as advertised on Amazon.Will update review and stars once I hear a response from the company about these differences."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is a fantastic product, which IMHO, will be the next best-selling kitchen appliance. It gives you the option of cooking in several ways, without ever changing the pot in which your food is waiting to get ready to be consumed. Switching from sauteeing, to pressure cooking, to slow cook, back and forth is what makes this appliance so great. In the pressure cooking mode, everything is automatic, and one doesn't have to fear that the device will blow its content to the ceiling, as many avoid pressure-cooking altogether because they don't feel safe with it. Also, you can steam, sterilize, and make yogurt in this appliance. You have half a dozen or so preprogrammed meals if you wish to let the device work its magic without your interference.All the materials of the Instant Pot are high quality, and the stainless steel pot cleans in seconds after use. One may also purchase an extra insert, whether it is SS or ceramics. I did buy an additional ceramics, and it cleans even faster if it is at all possible that the original one.I bought the 3-quart version of the Instant Pot because I don't have the cabinet space to store the 6-quart version when it is not in use.  Otherwise, I definitely would have gone for the 6-er. The 3-quart is plenty for up to a family of four."

For a 3 qt pot it made enough for 4 people.Just got my 3 qt insta pot and have used it twice. I absolutely LOVE it. I wasn’t sure about ordering the 3 qt but was pleasantly surprised by the size. I’m just one person and this is the perfect size. Small footprint in counter, easy to use and clean. It cane with s steamer trivet, but I wanted a larger one. I just ordered the larger strainer/steamer unit.  Am excited to get so I can steam lots of veggies. I highly recommend."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've used this thing at least twice a week every week since getting it. It doesn't make cooking any faster for me, but it allows me to make dishes that would have taken longer using the traditional method. I do most the cooking (good cooking - my wife's idea of cooking is random item on top of extra wet rice) so I bought this for myself as a father's day gift."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I LOVE the Instant Pot.  My daughter has had one for months and has created some amazing dishes with hers.  I hesitated on buying one, as with my crock pot - it takes a lot of room and I don't use it that often.  The crock pot was over 10 years old, so I decided to donate it and replace with the Instant Pot which also has a slow cook option.  The 1st time I used it, I threw in FROZEN chicken breasts with some garlic, onions, peppers, salsa & in 12 minutes I had made some amazing chicken tacos.  Since then, I've been using it at least twice a week, and it has earned a permanent spot on the kitchen counter.  IP has turned me into a pretty decent cook."
2.0 out of 5 stars,"Must have a lemon here.  I had the more basic version of this pot and it performed well.  Gave to my sister in law and I wanted this one because of the increased options.  First issue was the lid did not lock and stay put.  Very different than my other Instant Pot which felt very secure when moved to the close position.  This pot you could move with one finger out of the close to open position.  This was scary because in pressure cooking that's a safety concern.However, first use, I pressed on.  Loaded in my ingredients for soup/broth setting.  Hit the button and heard the 3 beeps.  Then it lost power after about two minutes.  I unplugged it, plugged in back in, nothing.  Waited a short while plugged it back in, got the power display.  I think this one is just a lemon and not representative of the overall product itself.My experience with the earlier version has been great.  Returning this one..."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"So far, I've used this to reheat grilled chicken, roast broccoli, broil a cubed, already-baked potato, roast diced sweet potatoes and cook frozen chicken tenders. Everything has been delicious and well-cooked. The functions are easy to figure out and everything is easy to clean. My only complaints (and reason for 4 stars rather than 5) are with the size. It's pretty bulky and not easy to store on my counter - and when I'm using it, I'm not sure where to put my pressure cooker lid. For the bulky exterior, the interior basket is smaller than my previous air fryer, but that air fryer broke in less than 13 months. Overall, I'm happy with my purchase."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Until recently, I don't know that the air fryer isn't just for french fries and chicken niggets. I use it to replace stir fry and broil with good results. Brocoli and zuccini turn out like roasted. Stir fry meat turns out more even and juicer; they are even slightly browned like stir frying in a wok. It can also do a thick new york steak. The only thing I really want to try is roasting. But i think it can do a better job than an oven (the way I do it).For vegies I prepare them as for roasting, mixing with spices and oil. For stir fry meat I marinate the same but add lots of oil to it; oil will come back down. I do vegies and meat separately and put them together when serving. Instead of grilling, I add oil to a steak. Everything is air fried at about 400F. I turn everything once or none. You have to watch the last few minutes as the food with change drastically.The cleaning is a lot easier because there's no direct high heat. The footprint of the air fry tray is a lot smaller than a wok in the dishwasher. If you don't mind the smell of bleach pods you probably don't ever need to hand wash. But I'm fine with doing a little touch up after the dish washer.  My secret weapon that I learn from somewhere is to add washing soda to boiling water to remove any organic carbon, even if it's on the bottom of a pan for 10 years."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought this one for my daughter after receiving one for Christmas. I LOVE IT!!! I have cooked meat, soup, rice, beans and plenty more. I have heard that it makes very easily to peel boiled eggs, wine, and yogurt. Although I have not been as adventurous to try those I believe it to be true.The best part about using an instant pot is that you don’t have to stir your food every 15-20 minutes until it is done. It’s a “set it and forget it” kitchen appliance. No babysitting is required.And of course it cooks things faster. Just make sure you leave enough time for it to come up to pressure (about 15 minutes) and natural release (another 15 minutes).After many failed attempts to cook dried beans I learned to add extra water than the recipe on the bag of beans. You can always drain some of the water later if needed."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"We've have it for almost 2 years and have used it almost once a week with no problems...Until it completely died on us. We got the C6L error - Faulty LOW pressure sensor. As you see, I still give this product 5 starts. After contacting Instant Pot directly, and supplying a pictures, they shipped a replacement base to me free of charge. I will continue to recommend these to everyone because not only are they a fantastic product, their customer service was excellent. Just a piece of advice, buy extra silicone gaskets and designate them for savory, sweet and neutral cooks. We used 1 gasket for over a year and couldn't get the stank out of it. There are plenty of gasket sets sold here on Amazon."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"We are RV enthusiasts!  When we first heard about the instant pot we poo pooed it as another way to buy a combined appliance when we already had the same products in separate units.  Were we ever wrong!  We have limited space so we had to pared down & whatever we left at home that was the very item we needed!  We had just bought the at-home sized unit & my souse used it everyday for a week so we bought an additional smaller sized one for our RV!  Bless this pot!!  This is the single most pot we have at home & RVing!  It cooks exactly like our old crockpot & probably had bought 3-4 since it's inception!  No where does the old crockpot compare to the features an Instant pot!  It cooks dinners, desserts, hot drinks, some cleaning necessities, & almost any use around the household can be done here!  If you buy one, you will become an avid searchers for the plethora of uses on the internet!  Don't think the cost is too great as it is well within reason for all that you can do with it!!  Timer use is a must but it will keep everything warm if there is an emergency to not serve dinner on time!  When we are not RVing I bring the smaller pot home to use in making desserts while dinner is cooking!!  What more can I say?"
5.0 out of 5 stars,I was thinking about buying an airfryer but someone told me about this lid. It's a great accessory for the instantpot and works really well for airfrying. We have the 6qt pot so the capacity for frying is limited but we bought a rack add on that gave us up to 4 more tray tiers for airfrying. The lid is pretty bulky and sometimes we have to debate if we use the pressure cooker or the air fryer but overall it's been a great purchase.

  Had to give only 4 stars for two reasons: 1. Poor design feature with basic black color scheme throughout, resulting in exceedingly difficult to see/read digital labels and buttons on the panel, and especially on the lid markings! I have to usually apply light from a small LED flash light to enable me to read anything. I ended up using a silver, indelible ink marker to go over the raised, BLACK markings on the cover to make them easier to see. 2. The stainless steel pot is shiny and fine looking, except that it seems to retain minor stains from everyday cooking such as simple rice cooking. To have it spotless, I'd usually have to gently go over the surfaces with a gentle cleanser like Bon Ami. Operationally it is great - straight forward and easy to use."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I haven't had a disappointment with this fryer lid yet!  Easy to use, quick learning curve, relatively quiet and a great cooking source when you don't want to heat the kitchen.  By using both layers in the basket/rack there is room to cook for 3-4 people in a 6 qt IP.  Clean up is easy, although I do not put the basket in the dishwasher (I don't put any of my good cookware/knives in the DW).  Highly recommend for small families."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"I have to issues for using this:1. It shows message “food burn” too often, even with enough liquid.2. “Porridge” evaporates all milk from the holes!!! Everywhere is a mess!!! To wash all this mess and pot takes more time than cooking and eating.Everything else works good. It safe my time while I spend time with my little baby (well, when I don’t cook with “porridge”)."
1.0 out of 5 stars,"There is a problem with the Instant Pot, and probably all pressure cookers. On a Quick Release, where does the steam go, obviously to the ceiling, or to the cabinets.The diverters, direct the steam over the floor, where the moisture could land on the floor. Also, there are problems with the diverters.Instant Pot’s clueless CS, told me that this wasn’t a problem. I told him it was. He sent me 2 links. After I checked the first one, and returned to the on-line chat, the second link was gone.Is it too much to ask, how to contain the steam, without doing any damage? Maybe a class-action lawsuit, about damaged ceilings and cabinets, will solve the problem.This is 2018, design a pressure cooker that doesn’t have this problem.I did make a good black bean soup in the IP."
2.0 out of 5 stars,"Description claims it's ""easy to clean"". Wrong. It is extremely difficult to clean, requiring extensive scrubbing after each use. Even using the dishwasher didn't work. The cooked-on residue seems permanent. The pot also still smells of the last item cooked after much additional scrubbing. The lid seal area is also very difficult to clean and requires lots of patience to clean the latching areas. The cheap ""stainless"" pot sticks to food like glue when sauteing, leaving many bits burned to the bottom.  Non-stick coatings were invented decades ago so I don't know why they use this very cheap pot. It ruins the entire usability of the appliance. The pot is poorly designed - In addition to sticking, the bottom indentation makes it impossible to saute anything properly since liquid immediately drains to the side unless you pour in well over a cup to fill the area level. Slow cook function takes many hours longer than a standard crock pot, even on high (the ""More"" setting). The pressure cook function seems to work fairly well which is the only way I got a roast to cook in a reasonable time. Something else about the bare metal pot - it negatively affects the flavor of food cooked in it. Compared to my standard ceramic crock pot, which makes spectacular roasts, the Instant Pot seems to strip some of the flavor from the foods, especially onion and garlic. Using the same pot roast recipe, the difference in taste between the two was not even close. The pot does not seems to be high quality stainless. I'm not sure what it is but I intensely dislike it. I haven't tried many of the cooking programs like Rice, Cake, Eggs, Porridge, Yogurt, so I can't say how they perform. I bought it mainly for the combo saute and slow cooker functions but it fails miserably at these simple things so I'm returning it."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Update: On Prime Day of July 2016, I bought another one of these pressure cookers. So many times I have been in the middle of cooking and thought, boy would I really like another cooker! It got cumbersome pretty quickly having to empty the contents of one meal, cleaning the cooker, and then starting with another recipe for a side dish. Just thought I would update so that everyone knows how seriously awesome this machine is. Background of my cooking experience: I received this when I was 23 years old last Christmas. I had this pressure cooker on my wishlist for almost a year because I couldn't afford or justify spending that much money on myself, especially because I did not know how well this would work out for me. I didn't start cooking until I was on my own in an apartment during college. About 6 years ago when my boyfriend would drive up to visit for the weekend, I realized I didn't know how to cook, and it was embarrassing. I made a great breakfast sandwich and a colorful salad for a couple more years before I took a dive into ""real"" cooking. For the next few years or so, my boyfriend would become my guinea pig for all the various, horrible meals I cooked, all so I could get more experience in the kitchen. Even though we're not together anymore, I like to think it wasn't because of what I put him through. I still wasn't as great at cooking as I wanted to be. That's where the pressure cooker came into play.My mom bought me the cooker, the 6 quart size. She bought me a cookbook to go with it, the ""Electric Pressure Cooker: 365 Quick & Easy, One Pot, Pressure Cooker Recipes For Easy Meals."" This book is ESSENTIAL to go with this cooker. A necessity. You hear me? ESSENTIAL. This is because the ""recipe book"" that goes with it is not good, and I haven't used it at all. You, the reader, deserve a REAL cookbook. If you're already splurging on this pressure cooker, you might as well make the purchase worth it by buying the cookbook too. However, some of the add-ons from the pressure cooker actually include helpful information about how long/what settings to use on certain kinds of foods. I have used that. It also lists in detail what kinds of foods the settings are used for.This is now the end of June and I can honestly say that I have used this pressure cooker weekly, multiple times a week sometimes, and even daily (depending on my schedule). Thanks to the cookbook listed above, cooking blogs, and Pinterest, I have made some AMAZING, delicious, and FAST recipes out of this thing. I am continually amazed by this machine. This has made cooking so much easier, faster, and a lot more fun for me, so that I no longer feel like all that I do once I get home from work is slave over cooking for my household.This is not to say that the pressure cooker is completely intuitive. You will probably need to read the manual to learn about the different functions and settings. This is a complex cooker, and in order to take full advantage of the many things this baby can do, you should read the manual. Just look at it, will ya.Some of the few things I have made with this pressure cooker is honey BBQ wings for game nights (fall-off-the-bone wings that were finished in the broiler), BBQ bacon meatloaf (my fiance's favorite recipe, says it is better than his mom's-- take THAT, Kathy), sausage and cheese soup (tastes like the flavors have been cooking all day when in actuality it's just TEN, yes you read correctly, ten minutes), cheesy garlic potatoes, couscous, quinoa, salmon, baked potatoes, pan-seared porkchops (perfection in this thing!), bacon, pork taquitos, meatballs, risotto, Italian Zuppa Toscana soup, baked beans (and not from the can), casseroles, chowder, Hawaiian BBQ chicken, and more. This one device has allowed me to feel like a master chef that delivers exquisite meals. All of the recipes are cooked straight in the pressure cooker, because it has so many different settings like saute, brown, simmer, etc. This helps tremendously when it is time to clean up. A one-pot cooking monster machine.Some helpful tips: The pressure cooker has to warm up / preheat when you set it to cook something. As you will find out when you read the manual, actually setting the timer will delay your preheating from starting by however long you set the timer (can be useful in cases when you have other things cooking and want them to be finished at the same time). To start your pressure cooker, you need to hit the ""manual"" button (this is what I use no matter what I cook), adjust your pressure with the ""adjust"" button (also used when you click the ""saute/browning"" button-- adjusting the pressure for the saute function is the difference between ""sauteing/browning"" [normal], ""thickening"" [""less"" mode], ""stir-frying"" [""high"" mode], and ""simmering"" [""less"" mode]), and then waiting for the confirmation beep that will happen after you are done adjusting your settings. Be sure to close the steam release valve when you are cooking with the pressure cooker. This can be done by turning the steam release up. To do a ""quick release"" after your countdown is done, turn off the cooker and release the pressure by turning the steam release down (be careful not to hover your hand over this part as the steam will shoot out). You will know when it is safe to open the lid when the silver float valve drops, and actually, you will be literally unable to open it before it drops. When it comes to safety, and basically everything else, this pressure cooker is not the pressure cooker your grandma used. When I am doing a ""slow release"" of pressure, I of course first down off the cooker and then place a cold wash rag on top of my cooker until the float valve drops. It is normal to sometimes see puffs of steam come out of your cooker while it is cooking something. Also, my mom didnt notice the ""off"" button on the bottom right for a while, so whenever she had to switch between functions she would literally unplug the cooker and then plug it back in. This is not necessary.The only thing I haven't tried making in this is yogurt, but I plan to make it some day and will update this review afterwards.Clean-up is so easy. Take out the pot and let it soak for a while. Trust me, when you let your cooker soak for a day, the crusts and stains of food will come right up with a little elbow grease. Be sure to clean the lid and take out the transparent rubbery part from the inside of the lid. Don't forget to clean the outside of the cooker either, as food can sometimes get stuck in the lip of the cooker.After raving about this cooker to my mom, she bought one for herself, and we share recipes and knowledge about how to use the cooker with each other. It's a fun thing we get to bond about. I've actually convinced some co-workers to get one too, in particular one co-worker who is a caretaker for a disabled family member. She told me that cooking for him and her own immediate family was exhausting, especially because, in cases where he is on his own, using the stove or oven is too dangerous for him. When you're able to throw ingredients for a soup into the pressure cooker, and 10 minutes later (not counting pre-heat time) you have a delicious soup for days, it can really take off some of that pressure for some people.Some other things that I like about the pressure cooker is that these recipes do not require a lot of ingredients, and you will probably have most of them stocked in your kitchen already.The only drawback that I have experienced is it is not very intuitive if you have not used it before. But the userguide is helpful, and if you have any questions, you can comment and let me know!I've included some pictures. A go-to easy recipe for potlucks that everybody loves is: 1 cup of water, a bag of frozen fully cooked meatballs on the steamer basket and cook those for five minutes. Use a quick release and remove meatballs. Discard cooking water. Add 18 oz of BBQ sauce, 18 oz. of grape jelly, and stir frequently on tge ""saute"" setting until combined into a sauce. Add your meatballs back in and change the settings to ""keep warm."" Voila. Sweet BBQ meatballs.Pictures added show the bbq honey wings I made in the pressure cooker and then finished in the broiler. Other photo is bbq bacon meatloaf made in the cooker and then finished in the broiler. Last, the most amazing beef enchiladas--I cooked a 3 lb beef chuck roast in the pressure cooker and then rolled up the tortillas and finished in the oven. The last two pictures are from recipes found in the cookbook I listed. Happy cooking, everyone!"
3.0 out of 5 stars,"I'll update my rating as we use it more; but we did two pork chops and the cooking was completely inconsistent across the cooking surface.  Now that we know that, we'll make adjustments.  We really wanted to expand the use of our Instant Pot but I'm guessing this won't be the air frying option we were hoping for.  The basket is too small and it's really hard to take out for shaking foods like fries.  that's why it only got a ""3"" rating."

Saute mode take longer time to get hot2. Pressure cook mode leaks the steam.I contacted on issue 1 with customer service Instant Pot, I ended up sending lot of time explaining and sending the pictures and etc. etc. So far no resolution provided.Second issue I had with leaking steam- I thought this is gasket issues and I replaced the gasket,.. issue not resolved. At this time I decided to move on.I heard Instant Pot customer service is great, unfortunately they didn't meet the 5 star rating in my case."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"so, i bought this before the black friday sale. *sad face*. but, i had owned it a month by then and used it almost every day, so i suppose i got some good value out of full price!i was originally looking for a slow cooker with a saute option. but i didn't like any that were on offer. they either had the non stick inserts or the very heavy ceramic covered stone inserts. and in either, i just didn't like the idea of the covering chipping away and mixing in with the food being cooked. then i came across the instant pot. at first i skipped over it, because that many positive reviews just didn't seem right. there are so many products here on amazon now that have these review-for-discount ratings that bump up products that i'm more skeptical about items than i used to be (there's got to be something amazon can do about their algorithm on this). but it kept coming up in searches, etc, and my friend had been raving about her electric pressure cooker as well (not ip, just electric pressure cooker), so i decided to investigate. i went to their site, saw some other ratings and reviews on the internet and after comparing models, decided on this one. along with the pot i also bought the glass lid for use when slow cooking.the features that made me buy this were1. the stainless steel insert (ALL my cookware is stainless steel, with the exception of one le creuset dutch oven and a couple of iron griddles),2. the saute option,3. the slow cook option,4. the pressure cook option with manual adjustment options.now, before i delve into my review, i should make it clear that i do cook a lot, western and indian (if you're desi like me and are wondering how this fares with indian dishes, read on). along with the cookware listed above, i also have conventional pressure cookers: good ol' fashioned hawkins and prestige pressure cookers, which i have used for almost 15 years without trouble; i still have these and still use them.one of the first things i did with this was make a slow cooked chicken soup. it did wonderfully. i was thrilled that i could set the time and adjust the heat. i also used the saute option for onions and garlic before throwing everything in and slow cooking. a note for those who may have read some reviews stating that the cooker lid doesn't work in slow cook mode and gives the ""lid"" message. to use the original lid, you have to twist the lid to close position and turn the knob to vent. i guess the electronics of the cooker detects that the lid isn't secure if you just place the cover over it and don't turn it close. i'm actually very happy that i bought the glass lid because the cooker works seamlessly with it and i can see what's going on. most of my usage in the first few days was slow cooking different soups. they turn out great and the keep warm feature keeps the food at the right temperature to serve and eat without needing to heat the food again. and it's not super hot either, which my husband prefers. five stars.the real test of the instant pot came when using it as a pressure cooker and this is where i had to knock one star off. at first, it did great. i pressure cooked soaked raw chickpeas. perfect result. then, when i realized it was not enough for the number of people i was cooking for, i followed it up immediately with pressure cooking unsoaked chickpeas. perfect again. i mixed the two batches and you couldn't tell the difference. five stars still.then came the chicken curry. turn on saute, throw in onions, ginger, garlic, spices, brown to perfection. good so far. now, being a veteran pressure cooker user, i have made small to large batches of chicken and meat in my hawkins and have never had to worry that the cooker is too full. with this one, as soon as the level went beyond 2/3rds, i didn't get any pressure. okay. so it's electronic, so i'll keep the five stars and make sure the level stays below the recommended level. however, even when the level is half full, there are still days when it won't build pressure. the element heats, the timer begins and ends, but no pressure. one day the level was less than half and i still had to start and stop a couple of times before i actually got pressure. by this time the food was half cooked anyway, so not quite as convenient as i would have liked.before you say ""clean the lid and rim"", i would have you know that i clean the lid every time, as recommended in the book, removing every part as described and washing and drying them thoroughly and i also clean out the rim which, if you own this, is hard to get under. but i clean it nonetheless (because i'm a clean freak). so, i'm sorry instant pot makers, but the pressure is a little unreliable. and for many of us who cook regularly and need things that just work, this doesn't qualify for me as that quite yet. for me it's been 50/50 on the pressure cook score.that said, when used as a slow cooker or when pressure cooking beans like chickpeas, this thing is a champion.another note for the indian cooks: i made gaadhe aloo in this to go with kachoris. peeled and rough chopped the potatoes, briefly sautéed the spices in the pot, threw the potatoes into the pot on slow cook, added water and left them to cook. when done, mashed up the potatoes right in the pot to create the thick gravy with chunks of potato. perfection. i haven't tried dal yet, but i will update when i do.conclusion: i have owned this for a couple of months now and have used it a lot, almost every day. i love the convenience of it, love the slow cook and saute with adjustable options, ADORE the stainless steel insert, but only just like the pressure cooker. all in all, a good investment. so far. i would recommend."
1.0 out of 5 stars,"I owned the larger instant pot for years and never had trouble with it, but 6 months ago got the smaller one for smaller jobs. So I know how to use this thing. But this duo mini had exploded twice now! The first time I thought maybe I just hadn't sealed it right (even though I doubted that) so I was making extra sure I was not doing something wrong, but again last night it exploded again and the rice I was making went everywhere. Complete mess, and it could have really injured me or my dog who was nearby. I hope this is just a defective pot because I use this thing all the time so I don't want the replacement to have this same defect! I'm sending it in for warranty service as it's still covered. Very disturbing! While it's cooking, just to be safe, stay far away from it!!!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"It is my first IP and I have heard so many good thing about cooking in it. My only complain is it takes up so much space, LOL. It is hard for a small kitchen that we have a microwave, coffee machine, air fryer, rice cooker, and a kitchenaid. I have to pull a chair over and place the IP on the chair when I use it. So far, I have made beef stew vegetable soup which usually takes me 4 hours to get the meat tender. It took only about 1 hour on a normal pressure. 40 min high pressure for Cantonese porridge using short grain white rice. It is easy to clean and I love it well designed on the lock."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"I thought I would like this a lot more. I use it a few times a week to crisp things up but it just doesn't work the way I thought it would. For fries and other like items it takes WAY longer than a standard air frier. It dries them out and they crunchy, not crispy. I'm not sure that I would buy it again. It's bulky and cumbersome to move around. It is very nice to use I'm the summer so I don't heat up the whole house with the oven."

   I got the first one, and after I plugged into power outlet, I immediately detect there is electrical leakage. I requested to replace it. I received the second one pretty quick, thanks for the Amazon's delivery.  It was working fine, and no electrical leakage. However, just after only two days,  I got electric shock. I tested it with my digital multimeter, I can detect around 52 voltage just by touching the outside of pot surface. It is not always being detectable, but it happens frequently, lasts couple seconds to couple minutes, and then it looks okay. After a while, it happens again.This is unsafe product, and it shouldn't be on the market.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"This thing is a real game changer! Perfectly cooks rice. Wonderfully steams broccoli. Excellent for shredded chicken (it just FALLS apart!)Cooking tip from experience:Personally, I think their manual over estimates cooking times for vegetables. If I use their recommended cooking durations, a lot of times they turn to mush. For example: My personal ideal setting to lightly steam broccoli crowns is to use the ""Steam"" setting, set the timer to ""0"", then release pressure as soon as it's finished. This makes perfect broccoli that keeps the flowers in tact, and the stalks a pleasant ""al dente"" texture. This same setting works well for fresh cauliflower florets, keeping a nice firm texture but taking away the ""mealiness"" of raw cauliflower."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love my Instant Pot(s). I have two--bought #2 a week after having my first.It's a versatile piece of cooking equipment that has me doing thing I never even thought about doing just a few weeks ago... making great soups, healthy apple crisp, yogurt and greek yogurt, easy poached and hard cooked eggs, and all the kinds of things you would typically think of with a pressure cooker, slow cooker, rice cooker, saute pan, yogurt maker... I don't even remember all it does.What I really like-- I control all of my ingredients while easily and quickly making things that I might otherwise buy packaged. We are eating more fresh and real food without the stuff I can't pronounce. My fridge is always stocked with jars of fresh soups, fruits, vegetables, yogurts and great healthier snack options.The biggest drawback I have experienced so far-- everyone got one for Christmas. Because electric pressure cookers have suddenly caught on, finding reliable sources of recipes for all the things that an Instant Pot can do is tough. There are thousands of amateur recipes flying around. Every day hundreds and maybe thousands of new recipes are posted on Pinterest and Facebook and cooking blogs. Some of them are amazing, but some are way off. Even the Instant Pot Recipe book that came with both of my Instant Pots is screwy. On page 26, there is a recipe for ""3 Minute Steel Cut Oats"". I tried it, my Steel Cut Oats were as chewy as wood. In looking back to see what I did wrong, I was flipping through that same book. On page 32 there are cooking time tables which show that you need to cook Steel Cut Oats for on high pressure for 10 minutes.Getting cooking times right is a little tricky in that you need to adjust for the amount of liquid you are bringing up to heat, and the mass and starting temp of the food that needs to warm enough for the steam to start building up enough to hit pressure and start the ""high pressure cook time"".Again, finding reliable recipes and adjusting cooking times is the quirkiest thing, but if I had it to do all over, I would still have 2. (I was just going to buy a spare liner/pot and spare seal rings, but when I went to do that, for a little more I just bought another complete unit. They aren't that expensive and I can see myself using both at the same time for parties.Buy one (or two)... you'll love it!"
4.0 out of 5 stars,"Works great, lots of online/facebook support for recipes and ideas. Very pleased it is a stainless steel pot so it's easy to clean, and can be scrubbed. Comes with a steamer/roaster/trivet to keep foods up out of the water when you are steaming or roasting. S.. It is a pressure cooker. The chief reason it's better than a regular pressure cooker is that it keeps the consistent temperature and pressure for a set amount of time. This makes you able to use it to get food ready faster without constant watching, much like a slow cooker - it can also BE a slow cooker.Also, you are not taking up stovetop space while cooking. Seems like there are way too many buttons, I generally use the bottom two and the -+ to set time, but I've only had it a month and may use other buttons in the future. (LOVE it for dried beans in chili or soup!)The darn thing is designed for right handed people - the plug is on the right side of the back and the lid lock and pressure relief seem backward to me - but I'm used to making those accommodations. BTW, the pressure relief turning stick looks like a spout - but that is actually just a plastic ""handle"" for your thumb to push over, so don't be hesitant to use it. Do be careful, the steam is hot, but it won't come out the side, just straight up out the top."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"This pot is daunting when it is first opened. It takes some searching (both internet and soul) to decide it is usable. At first I threatened to use it to pot a geranium. But with a little bit of patience I learned I can cook many things very simply and they come out delicious. My first trembling try was a pork roast, something I'd never cooked before and it came out very well. A small family could save much cooking time and effort using this fine pot. It seems very well constructed and is sturdy. Only a couple of very minor negatives. It would have helped if the buttons were lighted so they would be easier to see. I have to use  flashlight to see them unless it is very bright in the room. The recipe book that came with the pot is almost useless to me. Each recipe takes a large number of spices and ingredients which the aveerage single person/small family probably does not have. A simple recipe book for beginneers would be a blessing."

5.0 out of 5 stars,"Just remember you can always add more time but you can't uncook!I don't want to rehash what other reviews have covered. I hope these are additional points. I've done a whole dinner in 45 minutes from saute start to natural release finish without adding a degree Fahrenheit to my kitchen. I have not thrown it on a meter to test the power consumption but I suspect that it's a  fairly low total compared to using a stove or a slow cooker for several hours, plus it doesn't heat up your house in summer so will save your A/C from overwork. We already know it's a time saver but also the net power savings will add up over time.There is a learning curve and it requires some trial and error. I found there is no one rule of thumb for adapting stove-top PC recipes to this one that will work consistently. Do not think you can just add 15-25% time to recipes for nonelectric cookers. I took six books out of the library, four were written for stove-top models, one for mostly electric pots and one that gives times for both in each recipe. The one consistent thing I've found is that the Instant Pot loses very little liquid so I usually add less than called for. Some recipes need extra time for electric, some do not, and some need even less time though they were written for stove-top and 15 lbs pressure. Err on the low side. You can always close it up and add a few more minutes of cook time (don't forget the extra cooking while it releases pressure) but you can't uncook a soggy mess!If you have a good library check out some books, or go online -- there's ton of info. Start with Instant Pot's own site and check out Laura Pazzaglia's hippressure blog. Those two sites have stuff that's specifically for the electric pots and shouldn't need to be adapted. Check out other food sites, and read the comments as you will learn from people who've tried to alter stove recipes for an electric pot.Consider purchasing an extra gasket. Odors like onion and garlic tend to cling and you want to thoroughly wash and dry a gasket before storing it. Having an extra one helps, plus you will hopefully not get stuck in years hence needing a gasket that may no longer be available (happened to me with an ancient Presto).I contacted Instant Pot support once with a random question and they got back to me very quickly. Good company with a good product. I highly recommend the Instant Pot and consider it one of my better purchases.I hope somebody finds this helpful. If you have a question please comment -- I'm no expert but I'll do my best to answer."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm not much of a cook and I've ruined meat more than I'd like to admit.  The Instant Pot gives me HOPE !!  I've used it several times since receiving it in early January.  It offers a range of tools from simple to complex.  Until I become totally familiar with it, I have to double check the user's manual, but when I don't try to ""wing it"" I have great success.I find that with some cuts of meat, I have to add time to the cooking because they just need more time.  For example, corned beef takes longer than most recipes will suggest.  It was much better the second day with additional cooking.So far, my best outcomes have been chicken cacciatore, chili and beef stew.  Next up will be chicken breasts and pork roast.  I expect to be successful.One suggestion:  if the cut of meat is likely to be tough try using the pressure cooker setting as in the recipe, then turn it to a lower/slower setting for another hour (or whatever time you think it needs).  My beef stew was better the second day because when I reheated it, I actually was cooking it longer.I think I will need to experiment with what works best for each cut of meat and learn from experience.SO GLAD I bought this thing !!  Because, so far, it's given me great results.  Lots of recipes on line, too.I really like the saute feature as most recipes allow you to saute the meat and onions/garlic/celery etc., then add the other ingredients, close the lid, and set it/forget it.One thing I have to remember is to allow it to get to full pressure before manually setting the timer.  A couple of times I thought it was cooking only to discover that I had not let it get to pressure.READ THE USER'S GUIDE !!!  And check out all the online recipes.Actually, I just sent one to my sister who needs to start eating healthier meals on a limited budget.UPDATE:  FEB 15REMEMBER WHEN I SAID TO READ THE INSTRUCTIONS?  Well, I was using the TIMER button instead of the ADJUST button.  So all I was doing was delaying the start of the cook time.  DUH !!!  Setting the Instant Pot to cook my items manually requires me to FIRST set the pressure.  THEN, manually ADJUST the time up or down using the ADJUST button.  Do all this within the first 10-15 seconds after you begin the process or you will need to press the cancel (KEEP WARM BUTTON) and start over."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Got the 3 quart unit. Good size for a low population household. Great job with most things I've made. Notably yogurt making has improved for me in that it gets the milk up to the right temp before adding my culture without scalding or much ""skin"" and then maintains the fermentation temperature and shuts off by itself--no guessing. Love the stainless steel inner pot.It didn't give me the same beans and rice that I made with a traditional pressure cooker, likely due to the learning curve required with new stuff. Just a wonderful tool in my kitchen."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"first let me say this: this thing does not come with any instructions on how to cook any foods other than a sheet that shows how long you should cook it. It does not come with any instruction on what each button on the front of the pot does so you will need to google some recipes and how to videos on whatever meal you want to cook. The instructions that come with it are basically how to set it up and how to replace parts and what not to do to keep from hurting yourself.With that said, this thing is awesome. I hate cooking too. With a few google look up and guides and a few recipes later this thing cooks very well and quick. I do not have a single complaint on its cooking ability. It’s easy to do once you learn it. Pot in the center comes out for easy cleaning just like a rice cooker. I would recommend this to anyone that likes a easy, quick, tasteful meal without all the hard work standing over a stove.Only gave it 4 stars because of the lack of sort of instruction book on what each button does and how to operate said button or some little quick recipes and how to’s to get you started."
3.0 out of 5 stars,Too small! The pot that is included to use the air frying function is very small! I will have to keep my dedicated air fryer that actually holds enough for a meal.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love that I can slow cook or use the pressure cooker to make my meals! This has so many options for ways to cook and I just love it! I live alone and sometimes I just don't feel like cooking in the evenings so I wasn't eating very healthy. Now that I have this, I can put food that is good for me into this in the morning when I have more energy and still have a dinner that is healthy for me in the evening when I don't have the energy to stand at the stove! This little 3 quart is just perfect for me to have a couple of healthy dinners for myself. I wouldn't recommend this size for more than 2, maybe 3, people but they have larger sizes and I think it is well worth the money if you don't have time to cook or don't have the energy to stand at the stove for extended periods of time."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"First one I received only had a few functioning buttons and did not work in any low temperature settings.  Returned it and second one works great, which is why I rated it four stars. But make sure you check every function as soon as possible after receiving it or you could get stuck! I was almost too late to exchange it. (I also read other reviewer's who said they had similar problems with nonfunctioning units, which is why I wanted to test every function.  This admittedly takes several hours.)  Other than that, it makes perfect, fluffy brown rice, although not with the preset rice button.  (The rice button is only for regular white rice.)  I thought the stainless cookpot might be a problem cleaning after using the pressure cooker function, but it's not. Overall, I really like the various functions as it has made it somewhat easier for my husband to use it, as well. I do find, however, that we both need the manual to remember how to operate it for our recipes, as many do not conform to the preset function buttons.  Also, I have to remember to be very careful when releasing the steam to do it very slowly and to avoid reaching directly over the unit (which is my first instinct), or I get scolded. Nevertheless, I would buy it again without hesitation."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"10/10 recommend this unit. I wouldn’t be thriving so well off-campus this semester had it not been for my Instant Pot. Without it, I likely would have never ventured on my own to make the following entrees/sides reliably and with great confidence:RiceBeansTso’s ChickenSpaghettiMac ‘n cheeseSloppy joy sandwich meat (contentious item I know)Now the above doesn’t seem like a lot, but coming from someone that previously couldn’t cook to save their life, I’d say I’m not doing that bad for being just 1 month into this school year in which I’m without a meal plan.Did I mention that I’m saving a butload of $$$ no longer eating out?Oh, and I can actually cook quite a few more things that I didn’t list above. The list solely included entrees/sides made with the Instant Pot... and I’m looking forward to broadening it, greatly!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This stayed in the box for a 1 1/2 weeks before I used it bc it was scary and overwhelming. Instructions are still not clear even though I can tell they have improved it from the reviews of the earlier InstantPots. Thank God for bloggers!! I may have never used my InstantPot if it were not for bloggers sharing information and recipes.  I have made chili, chicken zuch noodle soup, chicken tiki masala, orange chicken and rice. Everything has turned out great. Make sure you have all the ingredients cut and ready to go bc the saute' is very hot and you need to add ingredients quickly and stir so it doesn't burn. I'm not really sure if it has saved me time cooking but I think it may be due to fact I am making complicated dishes that I don't normally make. I bought this so my husband could make chicken quickly before work but there's still heat up time, steam release time and the actual cooking time. So yes, it may only take 15 min to cook frozen chicken but you should add about another 20 min on top of that. So he does not use it. Since this is a newer version some of the recipe instructions from bloggers may not match. But you figure it out. I use the cancel button a lot trying to figure it out and also when the saute is just too hot and it needs to cool down. I haven't made a cake yet bc I need to buy another ring. Yes, the rings keep the smell of the food you cook. I think I should have just bought the cheaper one anyways bc I don't think I will really use the other options. So far my favorite recipe is the copycat recipe for Wendy's chili. I have made different variations using different meats."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Arrived pristinely packaged in full retail box with stronger shipping container surrounding it.It works as described in the many online articles singing its praises. Ive been using it for speedily cooking chili, excellent rice, steel cut oats, and stews. The mini is exactly the same capacity as the cheap crock pot that I had, but produces much higher quality meals. Mainly because the crock pot would overcook anything put in it even on low, especially if it was anything under 100% full. This makes the instant even better at holding food to the next day as well, with its long 'keep warm' state. (10 hours after the sequence stops, on the model I received. Ive read that for some its models its as long as 99 hours.)"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love it! I was initially intimidated by my new Instant Pot, but I watched some YouTube videos, and bought an accessory kit and some cookbooks. I was able to cook carrots and onions together in beef broth in a steam basket accessory (7 minutes) to make them taste as if they cooked with a roast for hours. Shepherds's pie was one of my first tries with the instant pot (I assembled the rest and baked it). Egg bites are quite easy and tasty in the egg bite mould accessory. My biggest glee is how it cooks frozen chicken breasts in 30 minutes and after letting it naturally vent the chicken falls apart. Literally. It fork shreds. So far I have made chicken pot pie (using the chicken and finishing in the oven) and bbq shedded chicken (making the bbq sauce and finishing in the crock pot). I am told chicken tacos are easy with the instant pot. The biggest hurdle is to get over the fears of, yet again, another ""fad"" kitchen item. Again, watching the YouTube videos helped a lot. For instance, I learned to throw a kitchen towel over the top if I press quick vent so as not to get a steam burn or send a force of steam to the ceiling and cupboards. Also, to make sure to buy extra seals because the smells of the food absorb into your rubber seal. The recommendation is to have one each for cooking veggies, meats, and sweets. Have fun and don't forget your cookbooks and accessories!"
4.0 out of 5 stars,"my love for my instant pot is real.  I have made yogurt.  I have made rice, ribs, indian food, collards, that wild rice & chicken soup every body raves about, I've cooked meat from frozen and it turned out great.  I'm buying instant pot cook books, I'm converting my favorite recipes to instant pot.  But the app?  Why advertise you have this instant pot app when it is so crap.  Send people to Pintrest instead. Pintrest is a better instant pot app than the instant pot app. Instant pot groups on social media are better than the instant pot app. The instant pot endorsed cookbooks are so much better than this app.  You're making so much money, why not spend a little money developing this app as it should be, making the search function work, making the recipe scaling work (because that would make the recipes work better for all sizes of the different models) make the search allow people to limit their search to just the model they're using. Give a nickel or two to some of the people developing great recipes for your machines and putting them up on the internet in exchange for permission to put them in your app, just to make it easy for the newcomers.  My love is real, that is why I speak the truth."
1.0 out of 5 stars,"Am I the only person who likes clear, written directions with a new appliance? There is no description of the differences among air fry, roast, bake, etc., and how to decide which mode to use. There are no sample recipes to try. I am disappointed since trial and error seems to be the only way to use this costly device"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have had my Instant Pot Duo for maybe 10 years. It has worked well all those years and normally gets used 2-3 times a week. I was looking at getting some sort of Air Fryer and started doing my research. I finally decided to upgrade the capabilities of my pressure cooker. As I looked at various possibilities I noticed the difference in the components of lids that would fit my Instant Pot. One of the lids used a coil spring heating element vs the Instant Pot Air Fryer Lid which has an element which looks more like an old fashioned stove top element on a burner. The Instant Pot Air Fryer Lid just seemed to have a better build quality. That along with how well my pressure cooker held up convinced me to by the Instant Pot Air Fryer Lid. I have cooked pork ribs and chicken using a combination of pressure cooking and air frying, an air fried blooming onion, chicken tenders, fries, onion rings, fish and chips and a few other items. It works very well and was cheaper than buying an air fryer oven. The combination of quality, expense, and common sense (why buy a separate air fryer oven) made sense to me. Just like my Instant Pot Duo, the longer I own it the more uses I find for it. I am very happy with my purchase"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Es tremendo producto, los alimentos se cocinan en un tiempo record y nos sobra tiempo para reposar viendo la TV"
1.0 out of 5 stars,"I really had such high hopes for this product, but after only 3 months of use, it is DEAD! Went out right in the middle of pressure cooking some boneless skinless chicken breasts. My husband contacted customer support at the company and was told it was probably a fuse, but I'm not sure if Amazon will assist with this issue or not. $145.00 is a lot of money for me to pay for an appliance that only lasted 3 months. It was handy, and I loved the yogurt function plus I batch cooked chicken once a week for my chihuahua who is diabetic  and does best with a home cooked food. Also loved cooking roasts and pork loins in it for BBQ pulled pork, but this is seriously ridiculous for this think to go out so quickly. VERY DISSAPPOINTED!!!"
3.0 out of 5 stars,"I thought I was buying a good gift (bought 2 of these for different people)... however, to really make good use of the Instant Pot, you will probably need spend $50-100 on accessories (plus shipping) to make the most of it ... steamer basket(s), trivet, slow-cook lid, non-stick pot, etc... the list goes on.  Beware, this will not be a ""one-and-done"" purchase.  Now that Christmas is done, it looks like many of the free shipping options are done (without joining Prime), so be prepared to spend $7 on a steamer basket and then add $6 shipping - ridiculous."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"Best pandemic purchase! I am cooking all meals even ones I take to work (essential worker) and this thing makes it so easy to make quick and delicious meals. Love it. 4 stars only because I think it should come with the ceramic non-stick insert that I purchased separately after several uses with the stainless insert it comes with. Don't even use that stainless one anymore. The 3 quart is perfect for small kitchens and households with 1-2 people and still have leftovers for another meal or 2. I don't like a lot of leftovers so I'm happy with the small size. I can't stand eating the same thing for a week Lol. It's so easy to make soup, stew, chili, mac and cheese, gumbo, jambalaya, pasta, etc. in minutes so why make 6-8 quarts of something if you can whip up something else? You can find recipes online easily but be sure you always search for instapot mini recipes. Recipes for larger pots don't work put so well for the mini. Also got the instapot mini glass lid. Highly recommend that when using slow cook mode or just keeping things on warm mode."
1.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased this 10 quart instant pot (Duo Nova 7 in 1) based on some reviews by the appliance industry. I contacted customer service but never received a reply. What instant pot does not tell you is that it does not make silicone rings for replacement, additional inserts,  or accessories designed for the 10-q.  In my opinion, this is an example of built-in obsolescence- you buy the pot but you can never purchase replacement parts or accessories. I really wanted to have an additional inserts so that I could prepare several different things simultaneously, but apparently they are not offered. Instructions clearly stated to use only instant brand replacement parts which is really a joke considering they don't make them for that pot, and the replacement parts for other brands don't fit. I thought I might order an 8-quart pot as a consolation to my dilemma but I decided not to purchase anything made by instant pot again. Instead I will go with a completely different brand, such as the the food Ninja."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I like that I was able to get a lid to put on my instant pot instead of having to buy another appliance. I cooked some frozen chicken tenders using the air fryer lid and they came out great. They were nice and crispy and delicious. I think there's a little bit more cleaning that has to be done using this product then a regular air fryer. You have the basket to clean of course, as with any air fryer. You also need to wipe down the inside of the lid before putting it away in your cabinet. I imagine you don't wipe down the inside of an air fryer all the time. Then you also have the metal pot that is inside your instant pot that will need to be cleaned since you leave that in your instant pot and put your fryer basket inside that pot. Other than that it's easy to use it's just a matter of setting a routine of setting it up and cleaning it up.Even though there's more cleaning involved I'm still glad I have this to use instead of having a whole another appliance. I will say though the lid and basket does take up as much room as having another appliance. Only difference is these pieces get stored in my cabinet with my pots and pans not on my counter. I am happy that I purchased it and will be using it a lot."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"I am not sure why it took me so long to buy this cooker. It is large and will take up a lot of space if I need to store it away, but it is worth it. I went back and forth between this model or the max and this model had the least amount of technical issues. I did the water test first thing before making a dish.  I made teriyaki chicken and chili beans the same week. Both of the dishes took only 20 minutes! I did not care to use the saute feature because I rather sear on the stove top for better color and flavor profile. I hope this last me years to come. I did have a dent in my instant pot, but it works and the dent isn't a big deal as long as it did not damage the product all together. I'm not sure why people throw in frozen chicken and expect it to taste good. It's hard to believe and I am never going to do that. I would suggest this product to my friends and family!"
3.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchase this one because I already had the pot and the lid is easy to clean. I know most air flyer cannot take off the lid, so the heater and the fan are really hard to clean. But this one can completely solve the problems. I am not going to it 5 stars rating because the first one I have received has defects. The fan was making noise when cooking. So I have to replace it. Right now, the new lid works perfectly."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love, love this product! Works as advertised. I used the air fryer and the roast function upon arrival. The air fryer basket cleans easily. French fries were very crispy. I also roasted a pork loin. Does as well as the oven without heating up the house. I highly recommend it. The weight of the lid is not a problem."
5.0 out of 5 stars,This is the absolute coolest thing ever. I already loved my instant pot. This made me love it even more! Everything I’ve made has turned out phenomenal. Super easy to use. I’m in love.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I was hesitant, but when you see all the reviews at some point you think ""these can't all be fake"".  They are not, this thing can be wonderful.  I say can, because it can make some amazing meals.  But I do think sometimes people are looking for excuses to use it when the ""old way"" can be as fast, as tasty or as convenient as making something in this.That said, I am a casual user, not the everyday cook from scratch person.  My biggest complaint is that while it does cook quickly, it takes a significant amount of time to come to pressure.  Just like it only takes a couple minutes to cook your pasta in boiling water, you still have to wait to get the pot to boil...The second area where I find fault is that some meats tend to be bland when pressure cooked - kind of like you power-washed the flavor even if you sauteed them to start, so I have learned to manage the recipe types and expectations.  This really speaks to the urge to make EVERYTHING in this wonderful device, even if maybe you shouldn't.I've barely scratched the capabilities of it, but even for the limited things I've done, it has been well worth the money.  My wife LOVES a chicken vegetable stew recipe I just discovered - and the pulled pork was amazing.  Pasta was a mixed result (I keep looking for a good solution on this one) and even something as simple as steel cut oats is a great use for it.  Enjoy it and experiment - there is no lack of potential recipes out there."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"So I was convinced that Instant Pots were yet just another gadget that would end up at my local Goodwill after a few months.  I'm already a pressure cooker fan and have both a Fissler and Fagor which I absolutely love.  However I wanted a smaller one that I could make sides (Risotto, Polenta, mashed potatoes).  For $50 I thought it was worth the risk to see what all the fuss is about.  First, I'm impressed by the build quality.  It doesn't feel cheap at all.  Second, I thought the saute feature would be a joke and was expecting to brown separately.  Well, so far I've made risotto twice and Polenta once with fantastic results!  The bacon browned perfectly and I was able to saute the onions effortlessly.  But the the best part was I didn't have to monitor the cooking at all.  I just set it and walked away and enjoyed a glass of wine!  I may get the larger one after all!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"My big IP which is great for putting up big pots of greens draws too much current to power with my inverter when power is out like the other day after storm.    Keeps shutting off.   So, I got the smaller one that runs at lower wattage, and the buttons are a little different, but I think I have the recipes down pat now for my usual lunch and supper and able to cook both meals using one of my small 35 amp hour batteries and the inverter.   And this is ideal for my one pot meals I have eaten for years every day... and if Prius camping.   Can heat tea water with it too.    It actually seems to use a little less energy than the big pot for the same job, but garbanzos came out fine and brown rice too.   I do soak them though, and now I learned to use delay button so I can put supper on right after lunch dishes are done and it will be cooked and cooled just to right temp so there is no last min. rush and burned tongue from being too hot and too hungry at the same time.  LOL..   It has the ""keep warm"" option to hold it til supper time if it starts at 230 or so.    All my cooking now done with 1/4 kilowatt hour of solar energy stored in battery!   That is 2 cents of energy.. Grateful!!   I'm still learning how to cook.   haha"
1.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased this air fryer with my Instant Pot Duo.  I was very excited to get both of my items.  I love my Instant Pot and have been using it a lot.  However, the air fryer was a major disappointment.  I thought I'd start with chicken wings.  Was supposed to be easy to do and I figured if I messed up, it would not cost me too much. Unlike a regular air fryer, the basket for the Instant Pot air fryer lid is a small round basket.  I could only put 3 wings in the bottom standing on end, then had to insert the metal rack and put 3 more wings on top of that.  The lid is not easy to handle but finally got it on correctly.  Set the timer and when it was time to ""shake"" the food, it was a real pain.  You have to completely remove the lid and set it down on the counter.  In order to move the wings around, you have to remove the basket from the Instant Pot, take the top three wings out of the basket and put on a plate.  I could not remove the metal rack since it was too hot and it only has 2 small holes to put your fingers through to remove it.  Left the 3 chicken wings in the bottom and put the other 3 back and then had to get the lid back on.  When it was finished, none of the wings were cooked and the bottom three were a mess. And forget about using it for french fries.  You'd be lucky to get 10 fries in it.  I packed the lid back up and returned it that day.  I ordered my new Cosori 5.8 quart air fryer and am loving it.  So easy to use.  Big basket easy to pull out and arrange anything you want."
1.0 out of 5 stars,"It works just fine.  However, I cannot get over the lingering food odors.  Both the lid and silicone ring which have been washed and soaked in everything I could think of are still making my kitchen stink two days later.  It is awful (and what I cooked wasn't even spicy).  It has just compounded the smells of everything I have cooked in it to date.  I cannot even imagine using it to cook oatmeal or something.  If you are sensitive to smells, I'd save your money and just use a crock pot.  That never stunk after being washed."
3.0 out of 5 stars,"I ordered this specifically for use as a slow cooker, and I have to admit, I haven't used it for the other uses, which is why my review isn't as glowing as many of the others. My older slow cooker finally died, and I ordered one of the newer, digital models. What I found, and was confirmed by other reviewers, was that newer models, mandated by the FDA, cook at higher temperatures, so they are no longer really ""slow cookers.""I ordered at least 3 different models and makes, and they all ruined my tried and true ""old school"" recipes that I used to make for years, you know the ones that you used to throw in before you left for work, and you came home and they were perfect. Not now. If I cooked my famous Tarragon Chicken in a new slow cooker, it was overcooked, dry, and stringy after only two or three hours. I was incredibly disappointed.So, I heard wonderful things about the Instant Pot, and it was made in Canada, so I hoped they didn't have to go by FDA mandates. Imagine my disappointment when I found the same results with the slow cooker feature. My Tarragon Chicken couldn't go all day in this slow cooker either. The most it could go, even on the ""low"" setting, was about two hours max. Some of my ""foodie"" friends on a local food blog said to use the pressure cooker setting, but if I'd wanted a pressure cooker, that's what I'd buy. I realize I have that option, but I just wanted a real ""slow cooker"" like I had back in the day. I guess that's no longer and option. The FDA thinks we no longer no how to cook, even though we've been using slow cookers for decades, and have managed to live to tell the tale!So, while the Instant Pot surely has many different functions that I haven't explored, and I probably will, what I bought it expressly for, what a big disappointment to me."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is the perfect size for a single person or a couple. I bought the mini along with the ekovana stackable stainless cooker inserts.The mini is so kiss simple to use that it’s like it reads your mind, but the results turn you into a Michelin chef! I like the ability to either use the preprogrammed options or to use it manually. And the wide variety of things you can cook with this little powerhouse is incredible: aside from the usual type of meals you would expect, you are able to make yogurt, cheesecake, puddings, the list is only limited by your imagination!And the clean up is so easy! This mini is small and easy to handle for cleaning: it’s not huge or heavy making it difficult to clean. Take out the liner ( stainless steel), hot soapy water - clean up done! Quick wipe down of the unit- done. It’s very easy to clean the seal, so it’s easier to clean up the IPot and liner than scrub out pots and pans. It’s like having a vacation with great food.Even if you already have an IP or maybe a pressure cooker you need this mini for cooking sides or just for quickly cooking a meal; it’s fastee than fast foods and much healthier for you. There is no downside to this little IP. Happy cooking! 🤗"
4.0 out of 5 stars,"This has been a great product so far and does cook food a lot faster. I haven't used all the cooking options yet so will update as I do so. My only complaints are food sticking to the pot frequently even with use of oils or extra water so must soak immediately after cooking, the enclosed cook book isn't always accurate for steaming and the steam button is finicky and not good quality I feel. The steam release is a problem for placement it drenched my cabinets and I had button facing away and it shoots far so cooking on an island or away from them is kinda a hassle. Concerned steam button may be an issue over time but will see. Insurance should cover those defects if it happens."
2.0 out of 5 stars,"I was confused how to use this, so I gifted it to my soon to be daughter-in-law.  She took the time to learn how to use it and she loves it. Just takes a learning curve to use effectively, but it does all it promises, according to reliable sources."

5.0 out of 5 stars,"I’m not a beginner using a pressure cooker. This purchase replaced a Cuisinart pressure cooker that just stopped working. I bought this model for many of the features and it is compatible with the air fryer lid (haven’t used it yet). I am using the Duo Nova tens time more than my old pressure cooker. It has not failed with anything I have cooked. It’s’ purpose will be as a pressure cooker, rice maker. I have a crock pot that Is my work horse and a SousVide Supreme. I recommend the Instant Pot Duo Nova."
1.0 out of 5 stars,The first one that broke was cracked in the bottom and we couldn’t really tell until we smelled a ghastly smell coming from it.  We thought it was an anomaly and we bought another one. It quit working after about three or four months. It’s just my husband and I and we use things very gently. I gave my first generation six quotes to my son and it’s still going strong.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This add-on to our Instant Pot was the best decision. Used it to make fried plantains, wings, sweet potato fries, jalapeno poppers, tater tots. It is awesome and everything has turned out really well. Very easy to use. The only thing I would recommend that buyers take into account it that the cord is rather short. Be sure to have an electrical outlet and counter space to set the lid on. Also spray the basket with avocado oil for crispier foods."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"I do like my instantpot and I use it frequently, but my original intent when I bought it was to get rid of my rice cooker, steam pots, stove-top pressure cooker, and crock pot. After a few months of use, I have found that I love it for certain things, but it certainly is not a replacement for these other appliances.For steaming vegetables (especially corn, green beans, and broccoli) - it's perfect. It's also my go-to for soups, stews, and dried beans. For rice, I still prefer my rice cooker, and it definitely does not work as well as a traditional crock pot for slow cooking. In various FB groups, I have seen people bake in them, but I have yet to bake anything (other than cheesecake) that didn't come out too wet or dense.Overall, I am still glad that I bought it (especially with the great deal I got on prime day); however, it is not as versatile as I had originally hoped."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I hesitated to get an instant pot because I read it was great for meat, and as a mostly vegetarian I just didn't think I would benefit from it that much. But I started seeing lots of meatless instant pot recipes online and finally decided to take the plunge. I just got mine last week and have made two recipes so far, and both were so quick and easy I am completely sold. I have ordered a couple of cookbooks and have started looking for Thanksgiving recipes, because this is the best thing ever.First, I spent a long time deciding on which pot to buy. I had almost decided on the basic Duo, because I don't think I'll ever sou-vide, and I don't bake often so don't care about the baking option. But I realized that if it was an option I would definitely  forget to seal the lid! The Nova is basically the Duo but with an automatic sealing lid - totally worth it. Also an easier to read display, apparently, which I'm 100% in favor of since I'm old. I also went back and forth on 6 quart versus 3 quart. We're mostly 2 people, sometimes 3, so I easily could have gotten away with a 3, but decided on a 6 for three reasons: 1) most recipes are written for a 6 quart, 2) I LOVE leftovers, and 3) extra Holiday cooking capacity for guests.So last week when I got the pot I put it all together and ran the water test, and immediately went online looking for recipes. I found a recipe for Spiced Red Lentil Sweet Potato soup, and other than sauteing the onion and garlic (right in the pot!) I just plopped in all of the ingredients, pressed the appropriate buttons and it was done in about 20 minutes. I started the recipe at 4:00 because that was when I finished the water test, and I was excited, but because of comments online I knew I could just leave it until we were ready to eat! So nice! When I opened it at 6 everything was hot and perfectly cooked and delicious!Today we had a friend visiting who needed a snack because of low blood sugar. It was 3:30 and after giving him crackers and cheese I offered to make a cauliflower mac and cheese and it was so simple - just dump most of the ingredients, cook and then stir in the cheese. Again, so quick and easy, and delicious!We won't be having any guests for Thankgiving this year thanks to Covid, but for the two of us I think I can put a turkey breast with some onions and herbs in the instant pot with potatoes above to steam, then make the gravy right in the pot from the drippings, mash the potatoes and DONE. Roasted brussel sprouts and pecan pie in the oven. Stove top stuffing or home-made stuffing in the slow cooker. Easy peasy. I think this will be my easiest Thanksgiving EVER!I'm looking forward to trying lots more recipes! If you're on the fence, go for it. If you're not going to sou-vide I can recommend the Duo Nova. Sometimes simpler is better. I can't help with your decision on the size, though. My first recipe made so much food I haven't had to do much cooking since! It definitely made me think the 3 quart would have been fine. But then there's Thanksgiving...."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"We now have two of these, this one and the mini version (3qt). Here are the things we regularly use the larger pot for:butter chickensteaming potatoes whole or cubed for mashdouble boiling oatmealchilisoupdry beanswheat meat (Seiten)yogurt makingThis instant pot is run several times a day and has made vegan cooking so much easier.The two features we like them most are the count up timer after cook time is done and the separate pressure release button.FYI: if you have trouble making oatmeal, use the steaming rack with about a cup of water and put your oatmeal in a small bowl inside the pot. This will stop the oatmeal from lifting up and generating the ""food burn"" error.Also, if you want to save some money like we did, order from the Amazon Warehouse. Ours came with a dent in the side, but it's just a steel ring. I popped the bottom off, pushed the dent out and dropped a magnetic school sticker on the crease. :)"
1.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought the instant pot because of a friend's recommendation.  I should have done research, lesson learned.  It's not for me.  It take lots more time than I expected.  You really have to know the weight of your food.  If you forget an ingredient It's more than just lifting the lid to add it.  I realized I enjoy cooking, tasting, adding.  So do a little research before you join the instant pot craze."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I must admit I am shocked at the great versatility of this!!!  It's first use was sushi rice, which I manage to mess up quite often.  NOT IN THIS pot!!  Put in the rice, put in the water, set RICE on the screen and less than 10 mins later it came out perfect.  WOW.  It takes 20+ mins boiling on the stove and then I seem to get it too sticky or too dry.  So the next thing was beef stew.  In a normal slow cooker the beef was still tough and veggies overcooked.  NOT THIS TIME.  The guide said 20 mins low pressure (what?  not all day??) so I was skeptical but followed the guide.  Sure enough 20 minutes later OMG the meat just melted in my mouth WOW.  Perfectly cooked veggies too!  Blew me away.  I did butternut squash soup and less that 10 mins I had DELICIOUS rich creamy soup (with immersion blender of course).  I'm quite shocked at how well this thing cooks meats and HOW FAST I mean 10-20 minutes max and you have roast that melts off the fork and chicken that is juicy and tender!!  I wish I had bought this years ago and saved myself the hassle of slow cookers.  Going to be trying the cheesecake and desert ideas shortly.  Excited to see how it performs on those!  Best of all, EASY cleanup the bowl is thick stainless and nothing as of yet has stuck to it.  LOVE IT!!!!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"So I have had a multicooker for  years, can't do without.  I think any brand would probably do the trick but I like the presets on my new Instant Pot.  It also feels heavier, more solid.  Chicken noodle soup (pressure cook chicken in 20 minutes, then brown vegetable, add broth and shredded chicken/noodles), pork tacos, bbq beef sandwiches.  Great risotto (this one doesn't have preset but they all can do this).  We have beans once a week.  I originally bought one because regular crockpots don't have a delay timer.  Use this and slow cooked foods don't turn out soggy.  Can hardly wait to do cheesecake and homemade yogurt.  Awesome wedding gift! (and no, I don't have financial connections to the company but have drank the kool aid!)"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Definitely recommend this product, especially if you find yourself arriving home from work in the evening and struggling to throw together a quick but still healthy dinner.  We live in the south and it’s in the upper 90’s- low 100’s and our house gets very hot (AC has trouble keeping up), so this helps greatly with not having to turn the oven on and heat the house up more.  So far we’ve cooked a pot roast (pound and a half), chicken, and dry beans in it. Plenty of space. Amazed at how fast it cooks. The roast took 50 min, chicken 20, and beans 15 (dry, non soaked). The only thing I’m even remotely displeased about with this product is that it arrived with some scratches. Makes me wonder if it was truly new as stated. It doesn’t affect the functionality of it; just the point. So, I’d definitely recommend one of these for quick home meals. We went back and forth between this and the 360 air fryer for weeks and are very glad we chose this."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"For me, the best parts of using this are:1. I live in Texas where it’s hot. It keeps my kitchen cool.2. It’s a great time saver. Less time cooking, less to wash and cleanup is a breeze.3. I invent new dishes, but the Instant Pot following is huge. Folks share recipes and excellent videos to make trying something new so easy.4. With the 6 qt. 10 in 1, I can cook for 1 or 5. Get the 8 qt. and you won’t be sorry.5. Using the Instant Pot, I’m cooking and eating healthier than ever. You will be too.Happy cooking!"
1.0 out of 5 stars,Not cooking correctly!! Everything comes out watering yet following directions perfectly. I want to return it!!
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've now had my instant pot for two years and can only say it's one of my used kitchen appliances as I use it 5-9x/week. When my 15+ year old crockpot was beyond repair I did some research to find a replacement and stumbled upon the Instant Pot. I don't have a lot of extra storage space so the versatility was a huge plus. I've now settled into a pretty good routine where I use my Instant Pot for breakfast 5x/week and for several other meals throughout the week. My most-cooked meal is steal cut oatmeal for breakfast, something quick and easy every morning.Instant Pot Steel Cut Oats40g steel cut oats100ml waterSet instant pot to 3min, high pressure (I use the ""Egg"" setting). You can either quick release or natural once the timer is done."
5.0 out of 5 stars,In one short month I have fallen in love with this thing.  It makes the most delicious meals so quickly it is unbelievable.  I have the 3qt size because it is only me and that size is perfect.  I would say even for 2 people that is the perfect size.  I like to cook once and eat for several days and this size does it.  I have found so many great looking recipes on Pinterest that I want to try.  It is so easy to use.  Everything is done in this single cooker.  No more big cleanups to do.  If you are thinking of getting an Instant Pot don’t hesitate.  This thing is amazing.
4.0 out of 5 stars,"This is a great little unit. However, I have to caution potential buyers that virtually all Instant Pot recipes are designed for larger pots. 3 quarts is much smaller than most. So we have to adapt almost all of the recipes we use to fit in the smaller pot.Unless counter-space or storage-space is a big issue for you, go with the 6-quart (or larger).That being said, we use this all the time. We can now use dried beans for baked beans, instead of those in the can. And hominy has never been as good as what we make in the Duo.We're still experimenting and learning. As my wife said, ""I never wanted one of those things but I'm SO happy to have one now.""We'll probably move this one to our Escape RV Trailer because it is low enough wattage to be able to work off our solar inverter and then buy a larger one for our home kitchen."
5.0 out of 5 stars,Works great. I especially love the broil option. I can make pulled pork in my instant pot and then change out the lid to the air fryer lid and broil the meat a bit. So much easier than using the oven and another dish
1.0 out of 5 stars,"First and foremost, I bought into buying one of these because I somehow convinced myself that it would be worth it... especially being a family of 7! Well... the very FIRST time I used it, I got a burn notice. Well after much searching, I then realized that some type of liquid has to be used EVERY time to ""coat"" the bottom. Well, after using that method, I still continue to get the burn notice. I researched and found out that the NEWER IP models are made with a CHEAPER and LESS DURABLE insert which makes it prone to burning more than the older versions.I also thought that something was wrong with my pressure release handle but didn't have anything to judge it by because I've never owned one of these. A friend borrowed mine and she is an IP QUEEN... in other words, she own TWO of her own. She messaged me and told me something was in fact wrong with my pressure release valve and that I should call the company to see about getting it (or the entire IP) replaced.I have really tried to like this thing... but getting the FOOD BURN NOTICE ALMOST EVERY TIME! It has seriously ruined me ever trying another IP. I will stick with the old fashioned way of cooking."
2.0 out of 5 stars,"Returned. Pain to use. Hassle to flip food for even cooking, which even then it doesn’t brown evenly. The rack they provide to give you 2 layers for added surface area does not come out of the hot pot easily. So you have to take out the hot food on top, then take out the rack, which is super awkward, then  flip the bottom layer of food. Next put the bottom layer of food, the rack, then the top layer of of food all back in the pot. Flavor and quality of final product was disappointing. Way too time consuming and messy."
1.0 out of 5 stars,"Wash the stainless pot that is removable. Wash it as hard and as long as you like. Then wipe it dry with a white paper towel. See the black residue that fills up your paper towel?  This appears to be a cheap finishing process that leaves filthy black residue as a by-product. Only thing that gets it off is a very hard scrub with Bar Keepers Friend and lots of elbow grease. Not sure if it will come back after heating and use. Not sure what the health hazard is, but it's gross to think how many people are not seeing this and eating what comes out of the pressure cooker. You can search this issue with Instant Pot...I'm not the only one having this issue."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I cook every day. I have years of accumulated kitchen appliances (I even have the original Cuisinart circa 1978 that still runs perfectly; it could probably power a boat). So when Instant Pot came out, I though it was just another gadget and I didn't need it. WRONG. This is a wonderful kitchen tool and I use it often. It's really amazing, and I guess it's an experiential sort of thing...you have to own it and try it to fully appreciate it. Rice, steel cut oats, pot roasts, spaghetti sauces, soups, chili, grits---everything came out perfectly. When the pressure cooking is done, it keeps food warm without any sticking or burning...and you don't have to watch or worry about it. Easy to clean, too."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Yes, it does all that. I’m giving it a rating for durability that I hope it earns. It cooked about everything for a dinner party for 4. Thank goodness we hadn’t invited more people when the stove (that’s a non-standard size!) broke. I sautéed pearl onions perfectly in it beforehand. I pressure cooked chicken into perfectly done (Food Network Instant Pot Adobo chicken recipe - 66 reviews and 5 stars) while we ate the salad. It was hard to brown the chicken parts because it’s surface area is small, but that was the only hitch.Sad to say, it replaces an available-only-at WalMart Instant Pot with greater surface area  that was recalled for electrical issues, but a recall that WalMart failed to note on their website. Amazon has informed me when they sold me something that was recalled, so I’m buying it here from now on."
3.0 out of 5 stars,Not much capacity using 6 quart instant pot so took almost hour to cook 4 pieces of fish because had to cut into smaller piece and then could only cook 3 small pieces at a time
5.0 out of 5 stars,"The Instant Pot 7 in 1 Duo is the latest generation Instant Pot, and my THIRD Instant Pot!  Did I NEED this one?  Not  r e a l l y, but I sure did WANT it!!  It has so many brilliant features that it always seems to be on the counter. While we had one recipe in the pot, it always seemed to there was something that we could have ready to go if only we had another stainless steel inner liner.  Because my husband is equally addicted, shortly after that came the second pot, The Smart Pot.  The differences in the 7 in 1 Duo pot and the first pot, The Lux, are VAST--I no longer have to wonder where to put a hot lid. It fits conveniently into the slots on either side on the handles. The MULTI-TEMPERATURE cooking levels ensure perfectly cooked EVERY time, including the SAUTE button that can be used to sear meats or saute vegetables. Here is a quick list of some of our favorite food, for which we faithfully use our Instant Pots regularly. And by that, I mean daily!Stocks and broths from scratch• Soup from scratch• Quinoa in one-minute•Steel cut oats, 3 minutes• Hard-boiled eggs there are easy to peel and come out perfectly every time•Thai Congee•Chilis of numerous varieties•Frozen chicken/meat, etc., which turns out fork-tender•Whole winter squash!  I've learned an enormous amount from the authors who sell pressure cooker books on Amazon. Jill Nussinow is one of them. When I  contacted her asking a few questions, imagine my surprise when she wrote right back to me! Laura Pazzaglia is another not only legendary author but, also a knowledgeable person about all things Instant Pot.  After you purchase your Instant Pot and are feeling lost- don't hesitate to contact cookbook authors.  I don't work for Instant Pot or these authors. I do derive great joy from all three, however!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This air fryer lid is amazing! We have used it almost every day since receiving it. I would definitely recommend it. It is perfect. Your food will come out  cooked and crisp. It is easy to use.  I love that it has a reminder in the middle of the cooking time to remind you to flip your food. The only downside is that you can’t just pull it out and shake to flip your food.But that is not something I would take a star away for. This air fryer live definitely exceeded my overall expectations! The lid is a bit bulky, but not as large as a whole different appliance. I love that I can keep one appliance and use it for a different need."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"My kitchen is full of gadgets and appliances I have bought over the years, so I was reluctant to add ANOTHER appliance that would just end up gathering dust and that I would never use. But I've heard so much about the Instant Pot that when I saw that it was the Deal of the Day for a 3 quart pot, I decided to take the plunge and but this little Instant Pot. I cannot tell you how much I LOVE this little pot. This little pot is so versatile - you can saute, pressure cook, steam, slow cook - it does absolutely everything. It's very easy to use and the best part is that you add your ingredients, set your cooking mode, and then go do something else while your Instant Pot PERFECTLY prepares your meal! It is worth every penny. I have not stopped using mine since it arrived. You can even make yogurt in your Instant Pot! I cannot recommend this amazing appliance enough. It will change the way you cook forever!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I had been wanting an air fryer for a very long time & stumbled across this lid. I already had an instant pot & figured it'd be a great way to see if I would even use an air fryer (I really don't use my instant pot). It's definitely bigger than I imagined it being - so even though it fits on the instant pot it's essentially it's own appliance. It will take up space in your cabinet. Also, the air fryer basket goes inside your instant pot metal pot - so it's actually pretty small & doesn't fit a whole lot. With that said - it does heat up to 400 degrees in about 2 minutes & does cook pretty dang fast. I love that I don't have to throw away any leftovers - especially now that we're using pickup more frequently with covid. Highly suggest for reheating fries alone - legitimately just as crispy.I'd say if you have larger family - this probably isn't for you. You'll want something you can fit a decent amount of food in. If you have an apartment or it's just you & another person - then go for it. It's so much faster than heating up the oven."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Skeptic. Literally. I was afraid of using it because I heard of all these horrible stories of people using pressure cookers and getting burned. A seasoned home cook, I finally took the plunge after hearing so many people tell me how great they love their instapot including my best friend of 35 years. And then last weekend we had a girl's weekend and the neighbor said that she loved her instapot. Enter Amazon. So after the girls weekend I did a little exploring on YouTube and Amazon. Decided that the instant pot duo Nova for beginners was best for me. So glad I did! It arrived on Wednesday. Took it out today which is Saturday almost 4 days later. Watched a bunch of safety videos on YouTube for do's and don'ts which was very smart because you don't want to dive into a contraption like this without knowing some safety protocols. Being a Navy veteran safety is everything it sets the landscape. . first thing I made was risotto. Follow the instructions after watching a YouTube video... 20 minutes was not enough following the instructions but I put it in for another 20 minutes and guess what? Perfect risotto. Later on I was starving and decided on making barbecue chicken. I don't like sweets and not crazy about barbecue but I thought what the hell I have both ingredients and it's on hand. Guess what happened? Came out perfect. Absolutely freaking delicious perfect fall off the bone chicken. So right now I'm a fan so I will keep you all informed and let you know how the parts hold up because you know that's the biggest issue with everything made today especially from China things fall apart within 6 to 12 months. Thanks for reading."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"A very good unit that is easy to use and fast, but not as fast as the propoganda claims.I did find, however, that the standard stainless steel pot, while durable, does make it more likely that when cooking thick stews you will get the dreaded ""burn"" message on the display. This is a consequence of all the heat being applied through only the bottom to the standard supplied stainless steel pot, the relatively poor thermal conductivity of stainless steel, and the lack of any convection (stirring) whatsoever. I replaced with the aftermarket ceramic coated aluminum pot (much better thermal conductivity) and no more burn messages.The other caveat is that the claims of very fast cooking ignore the long heat up times, typically a half hour, and the long de-pressurize times...an hour, typically, unless you use the VERY MESSY quick pressure release method. You may just cook for a half hour, but in reality your cooking takes about two hours from when you seal the pot's lid until the lid pressure lock disengages. Even then, the contents may be too hot to serve. You can, of course, do a quick pressure release, by turning the relief valve to vent, but then you get a geyser of very hot steam, and probably some of your pot food contents, too. Been there, tried that, never again. Dangerous and makes a mess.Overall, however, it cooks great. So far have made beef stews and bean and ham hock soups and results were wonderful. This is much more than a ""fad"" (like the Foreman grills); this is a great cooking appliance. Even my naysayer wife agrees."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I am having a great time experimenting and cooking with this little pot!So glad I purchased this.It is saving me time, keeping my kitchen tidier, saving energy, and the food is tasting so delicious as all the juices are preserved by pressure cooking.The only downside is, I have gained a few pounds since purchasing this..trying out all the new dishes.Still, I can now do healthier meals to lose the few pounds as well.The world is your oyster with this pot and I love the small size I got as there are only the two of us here, don't need the big pot.You won't regret this purchase, I am sure of it.I waited a good long while to buy this and am happy I did.YouTube is great for finding recipes and procedures too.Edit 9/23/2020I had sold my previous Instant Pot due to unforseen circumstances sadly.As of today, I had purchased another one and now will continue to enjoy it.So that should say something, I missed it greatly and have purchased two of these to date.No issues with them and love them!!"
1.0 out of 5 stars,"Mine was taking 3-4 times the listed cooking times to cook. Thats frequently double the cooking time by another method. After contacting the manufacturer, I found out that while mine was defective, the manufacturer said ""they are designed to be used within 400ft of sea level.""  So I did not bother replacing.I have used a stove top pressure cooker, but its starting to chip my glass top stove. I wanted a replacement to use off the stove, but from what I read that is unlikely no matter hoe much I am willing to spend. Why can they  make a stove-top model I acn use at 5100ft but not a freestanding model.  I even have a freestanding canner, and in process of getting a air-fryer and/or a rotisserie capable countertop appliance.I am a tech person, a gadget person, and I love trying new things....but back to my old reliable slowcooker that works at every elevation with minimal adjustment but perfectly reliable operation. Just because it new doesn't mean it better.If someone makes a version I can use at my altitude I want it.  i have food allergies and an autoimmune  digestive disorder, and I have to make my  own foods.  I make my own stock and bone broths for cooking basics and fewwze them. I really would live to have a product that speeds that up....but this isn't it!!!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"The Instant Pot is one of my favorite and most versatile kitchen tools. It's a fantastic addition to my small apartment kitchen. Perfectly cooks rice, shredded chicken, and pretty much everything I've tried in it so far. There's also lots of accessories available and plenty of recipes/how-to videos online. It replaced my rice cooker and my slow cooker with zero regrets. The steam release valve is a bit messy and a deep-clean can be a pain, but those are my only real complaints. When cooking, keep in mind this takes about 10-15 minutes to initially warm up before the actual cooking time starts. For example, a 5 minute cooking time for jasmine rice is misleading. For that dish, it's closer to 25-30 minutes (10-15 minutes for the initial warm-up, 5 minutes of cook time, 10 minutes of ""natural steam release"")."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"We bought this larger capacity Instant Pot for our family's vacation home.  We feed such large crowds at our vacation home, that we needed a bigger Instant Pot than the one we have at our main home.  Our favorite recipe is making pork carnitias.  Yummy!!!  This Instant Pot makes tender, spicy carnitias every time.  Make sure to use a pork butt, as we've found it is the tenderest cut of port there is.  This also works great for homemade soups and broth.  Bone broth, and homemade chicken soup are so nourishing and have made a come-back.  Turns out, grandma really new what she was doing back in the day.  The Instant Pot helps you to make bone broth and soups quickly, cutting lots of hours out of the process."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love this, I love this, I love this! And I really hate cooking. I have had this for a week and have made so many different meals that I don't think I have to go shopping for a while. I bought the 6 quart because it was on sale. I am so glad I did! I was eating out all the time and we all know what that can do to your budget. Read the instructions, do the water test just to get accustomed to how it works. If you read them while distracted you wont notice you set the delayed timer and not the cook timer and you will be unimpressed with the thing... until you notice your mistake and then you will fall in love.You prep all the food and most things you would do like browning meat will be done in the pot, not on the stove. -1 dish thereYou toss all the things into the pot, close the lid and set the time. *At this point you have a dirty cutting board and knife, maybe a measuring cup or twoYou wait for the pot to heat up until the time starts counting down. *So this time will be added to the cooking time, it all depends on the amount in the pot.The think kicks on and starts the cooking. I made a full pot of chicken stew in less than 1 hour.Once it beeps let it cool for a bit or just pop the release valve. It will hiss and steam will come out. Caution Hot.Clean up is simple, food is tasty, easy to use even if you miss a spot in the directions but don't do that.To make this even more amazing. I live full time in a travel trailer and this is a MUST HAVE. I may never eat out because I am lazy again.I am making sesame chicken tonight. All in one pot. Cooks rice just right! I am so going to try out this yogurt thing."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"Ok. I bought one of these for myself for Christmas. Before that I had at 8 quart pressure cooker for about 8 or 9 years? Now that's pressure cooker had a lot of settings too, you could saute on it, it had meat settings, soup settings, and a bunch of other settings, and it kept things warm automatically when it was done. I actually got pretty used to using that.Now I've put about five of my recipes in this instant pot I've used in my pressure cooker with no problems, now three times I got a ""Burn warning""? No I'm still trying to figure out why that is when there was no problem in my pressure cooker?Two times I was in the living room and heard little beeping noise and went in the kitchen and saw it was on Burn. Then it flipped off, then he went back to the timer and went back on cooking? But when cooking was done, it did have some burned stuff on the bottom. All the times I've cooked in my pressure cooker I never had any burn stuff on the bottom?This is kind of a puzzle to me? I upgraded because mine is getting old and it was getting hard to find a gasket for it. That and everybody was telling me it was time to upgrade and I should get one of these instant pots.So far I haven't seen much difference between this and my old pressure cooker. It has more settings on it which I haven't really tried them all out yet. But time will tell I guess. My pressure cooker was never really good at cooking rice, even though it had a rice button on it. I haven't tried that on the instant pot yet. That might have to be one of my next projects on the instant pot.I haven't tried hard boiled eggs in it yet either. I've heard people have had success doing that, and I've heard other people have had a hard time with it.Hopefully this instant pot the last as long as my last pressure cooker did, actually I still have it and it still works. If it does then it'll be worth the investment."
2.0 out of 5 stars,"If you are thinking about getting an instant pot because they are all the rage, just wait it out and buy the next fad. First, the steam-port, everybody is scared of it, and rightly so, you can get a nasty steam burn, use hotmits when operating this thing and keep pets and kids far way. Also, make sure you have a clear path as it releases steam upwards and can scotch your kitchen cabinet's finish. I think the best use for these is multi-pot meat dishes, that's the only real time saver, beyond that, you can make a better cake in the oven, you can make better eggs on the stovetop, you can make better rice in a cheap rice maker. There is very little I can't do better with a traditional method, and these things take up space in your kitchen. Buy it if you need a cooker with a start-stop timer and are trying to cut down on meat pan, sauce pan etc. That's the only good use. Vegetarians and vegans have little use for this unless you are trying way to hard to find a reason to buy a instant pot."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"As a stay at home mom, This pot is a game changer! I throw things in with minimal prep and sit down with my kiddos while it cooks (in no time). The other night I loaded up the van for practice while my meat and veggies (our entire dinner) practically made itself. Clean up is easy—it’s only one pot! I was initially worried about the pressure how-to but It’s very user friendly (I do use a towel to cover the hole when I release the pressure). So far I’ve cooked Chinese, fish and veggies, BBQ, oatmeal, homemade jam AND a flawless cheesecake!!!!! Our youngest has a bunch of food allergies so I’m typically in the kitchen cooking all day....not anymore! ...Y’all, I’m sold. We purchased the mini (3qt) to give this instant pot craze a try, but I’ll definitely be buying a larger one in the future to make room for the whole family (for those all-in-ones, like meat and veggies AND rice, or to have leftovers). If you’re on the fence about giving this a try, hit that purchase button. You won’t regret it. ....Note, I did NOT receive this product for free—I simply love it. BUT, if someone sends me a free 6 or 8 quart I promise you I won’t turn it down, haha. ;D"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I like to cook, though being a single person cooking can be a bit of a pain. I used to own a seperate crock pot and pressure cooker; the PC was the type that needed babysitting. I saw this 3qt model and took a risk. It's much easier to use than I initially thought; the the buttons make using it as simple as using a microwave.I like the stainless steel pot and trivet, and cooking one pot is something I'm already used to . I don't slow-cook as much as pressure cook, but this unit might change that. Like the seperate  rice and steamer settings, too; cooking rice has always been difficult, and I've developed a fondness for wild rice I can now indulge.Will be donating the old pressure cooker and crock pot to Habitat for Humanity's ReStore; I think this little unit is a keeper"
2.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought this Madeline to replace a 5 year IP that no longer works (also 6qt. duo). The heating element is not working nearly as well as my previous model.I used to make boiled eggs with 5-5-5 method — 5 min at pressure, 5 minutes manual release, 5 minutes in ice bath. They were way underdone. I then cooked a second batch of eggs for 8 minutes. Same result. See photo for level of doneness. There is no way I should have runny eggs after 8 minutes!I’d consider myself an advanced IP user and used my old model at least 4 times per week. Super disappointed! Exchanging and hoping I get better luck.Also, for some reason the ‘keep warm’ button lights up when you use the ‘pressure cook’ manual cooking function. I think that is very confusing. It should only light up when the pot is simply warming, not when it is pressure cooking."
5.0 out of 5 stars,I was scared to use this at first simply because it is a pressure cooker and I had seen some blow up. But after reading the entire manual and doing the test run step by step I LOVE this thing. I use it almost every day. It is a pain in the butt to clean but it makes things taste so much better and takes a lot less time to cook amazing meals which is a bonus since I have infant twins!
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Come back in while and it's ready to eat.  I'm old guy and I eat pretty simple.  The Instant Pot and an occasional frying pan coupled with my barbecue is all that I need.  Don't be scared about all of the buttons.  The ones on the left are all low pressure (probably means a lower temp heating element) and the ones on the right are for high pressure (probably means higher temperature heat element).  Different buttons have different preset times, and pressures but they all seem to remember their last setting so you can use them for whatever you want.  Or as I do I just use the steam button all of the time and change the temperature and when and if that fails I'll move on to another button.  It's pretty simple to use and pretty safe although you really want to stay away from the vent when your opening it early.  The vent control would be a lot nicer if it were longer so that you can keep your hand away from it more.  Don't forget to only put your stuff in the stainless pot.BTW if you searching the Amazon database and you run into my reviews and think oh this is a guy we'd like to review our products.  Don't bother, I won't review stuff just to make money and I won't give a good review unless it deserves it and I won't purchase or accept items for review unless I really want them and I probably won't take anything for free because my experience is that nothing worthwhile is ever for free.After using them for awhile I find them a little unreliable.  I wouldn't recommend setting the up to run and then going somewhere because all to often I find that they will leak a little our of the steam vent or sometimes the main seal comes out and if you're not there and listening for problems then you could probably cause a burnout.  So I would never use the delay cooking option.  Some will say that if you get the seal on correctly that you'll have not problems but how do know for sure?  I don't think there as reliable at a crock pot.  But I still like them ."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"LOVE LOVE LOVE my instant pot. I live in a small space that doesn’t have room for the full sized version and the 3 quart works amazing for me (also because I’m never cooking for a large crowd). The 3 quart size is also super convenient because I can just halve the 6 quart recipes. It’s just so convenient, if you’re thinking about getting one, do it. Highly recommend the smaller size if you are only cooking for yourself or 2 people and you don’t want to get the big one. Or, take the ease of instant pot cooking with you trailer camping."

   The pressure release valve is wobbly and reached out to the manufacturer couple of weeks back. No respond to the ticket still. Is it suppose to be wobbly? It locks well on release position but doesn’t on sealing position. I don’t know if the cooker is defective or is this how it’s suppsoed to be.Update - 2/4:Right after posting review here I got a response from Instapot. After a few back and forth email messages on some tests they want me to perform confirmed on 1/22 that the unit needs to be replaced. However they are out of stock and still waiting for the replacement unit. It’s now close to two months since I bought one and I don’t have a properly working unit yet."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm probably the last person on earth to get one of these things because I'm not into fads. It was the fact that I could supposedly make yogurt in large batches that ultimately won me over. And it's true, you CAN make yogurt in large batches with this one, although I'm still experimenting (1/2 gallon batches come out perfect, 1 gallon batches seem  thin...I'm messing with variables to try to determine if it's temperature fluctuations, more innoculant needed or what). You can make other stuff too and I've used it for various things. LOVE the relatively quick cooking of things that usually take hours. Rice comes out perfect. Lots of reasons to recommend this. It's particularly great for making a couple of meals for the week ahead that can be eaten all week."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"If you purchased an Instant Pot but are ""afraid"" of using it, I suggest that you watch a few YouTube videos of people who have mastered it.  My favorites are Six Sisters' Stuff,  ""How to Use an Instant Pot - Instant Pot 101 - Beginner? Start HERE"" (and other videos by them) and also Tried, Tested and True Instant Pot Cooking videos.  There are plenty of others, too.I made chicken fajitas and chicken corn chowder and both came out great.  The only downside (as EVERYONE will tell you) is that the silicone sealing ring captures and holds the odors of whatever you've cooked in your Instant Pot.  There are also videos on how to clean the lid/ring and ""get the smell out"", but it still lingers on the ring.  Oh well."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"This is another good way to cook in my Instant Pot.  I am enjoying learning of the different foods I can prepare now that I couldn't before.  I haven't had an air fryer before, but I'm pleased with this option.  The only bad thing is that it will only allow cooking of a small portion at a time, so if you are cooking for many, perhaps a larger air fryer would be better for you.  It's ok for one or two, but beyond that you may wish to consider something else."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This kitchen tool is the cats meow!Seriously!!!I bought for the primary purpose of making yogurt. Which it does... perfectly!But also have made several dishes as well as toasted an entire chicken in well under 30 minutes!  Everything comes out moist and flavorfully infused!I made a pot of brown rice, the rice was plump and moist. Excellent. The cooking time was cut by approx 35%I think the 6 quart all in one instaPot is the best kitchen tool I have ever had. It can replace your slow cooker, rice cooker and is easy to clean. I do recommend purchasing the extra lid gaskets. I did not, and I had a heck of a time Terri g my corned beef and cabbage smell out of the gasket. Will be ordering extras to havenone set aside just for yogurt making.Oh.... and the yogurt? It is so creamy and delicious. You can leave in for just 8 hours for a healtybprobiotic yogurt that still had some natural sugar inherent to the mil.Or cook for full 24 hours for the most heath benefits.The full 24 hour yogurt cycle (standard setting) cooks off the rest of the sugars and develops billions and billions of super probiotic bacteria, that tastes like heaven! So creamy and delicious!I start my morning with a couple of tablespoons of the probiotic yogurt topped with anti-inflammation raspbbrrrirs, blueberries,blackberries and sometimes a little bit of banana.For added fiber, I often sprinkle some kashi crisp or other kashi cereal.Amazing!"
1.0 out of 5 stars,i had one.  lasted just over a year and broke. loved it so much i bought another. i received my next one and used it once and the next time i used it i wouldn't even turn on!!! i went back to amazon to see if i could exchange it and its one day over the exchange date. i will not buy this product again. especially from amazon. i would buy it from a company that stands behind their appliances feror longer than 30 days. how was i suppose to know it would shell out after one use!!!
4.0 out of 5 stars,"After less than half a dozen uses, the steam release handle no longer works to seal in the steam, even when it is definitely closed. This resulted in a severly underdone roast and i am reluctant to try any more recipes until this problem is solved. This should not have happened. Amazon  should make it easier to report a problem with an item that they sell that can be fixed."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have only had my instant pot since Christmas but I have used it 1-2 times per week.  I love it!  I make potatoes, beans, soups, chili, etc.  My only complaint (that doesn't warrant taking away a star) is that the directions are trash!  This is a total trial and error appliance.  I look a ton of recipes up on pinterest and give it a try.  Sometimes my potatoes come out too mushy (but they've never been under cooked).  I can't wait until the summer (in TEXAS) to use this so I don't have to heat up my whole kitchen with the oven."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I own several pressure cookers, all of which were stove top versions. Love those, but purchased this for the convenience factor. With this model you can simply load your pot, set it, and not have to go adjust the temperature or time it once you start it. The additional benefit is you if  don't get right to it when finished, it will automatically set itself to keep it warm until you are ready. The drawback to the electric version compared to the stove top is that the stove top models are much faster.I was pleased with how relatively little room this took up on my counter, and it is lighter than I expected. There are a multitude of preset functions to help take the guesswork out, but be warned you still should confirm the cooking time prior to use. The stainless steel pot is terrific- avoid buying units that are coated as they will not last as long. You may also use it on a gas stove to brown in first, or simply use the browning option offered by the cooker. Note that this only has about 11 psi for the ""high pressure"" setting, so if using a stove top cooker recipe you will need to increase the time by 7%-15% to compensate. This is a 6 quart model, so if you have a large family (more than 4 people) look for something with a bigger capacity. I use a 10 quart Fagor model frequently for this reason. The directions to set up the pot are just so-so. One tip is when placing the lid on for the first time, set the arrow to the ""open"" spot, not matching the arrow on the unit. This is different than my stove top models, as with those you first align the arrows and then rotate the lid. Cleaning the pot is easy so no worries about it not being a non-stick type.Recipes- there are not many recipes provided with this unit, but enough to give you a little something to work with. When purchasing a cookbook I would recommend one designed for electric cookers in order to take the guesswork out of how to adjust the time. Bob Warden's book ""Great Fast Food"" has nice and easy recipes with common ingredients, and ""The Great Big Pressure Cookbook Both Stovetop and Electric"" is even better given times are listed for both types of pots and there are a lot of terrific recipes to choose from. I am a big fan of the Lorna Sass cookbooks, but those times are for stove top cookers so be prepared to do a lot of adjusting. If you are new to pressure cooking, go with the Great Big Pressure Cookbook, as it has a solid intro section on how to use the cooker. Check out the blog called ""Dad Cooks Dinner"" for more tried and true recipes that you don't have to pay for, and be sure to try the mac and cheese recipe there! Instantpot.com also has a bunch of recipes specific to the pot so that is worth a look.Update: I am shocked how much I use this- mujltiple times every week. It has simplified cooking,and I have easily saved the the cost of the gadget by the dramatic reduction in how much we go out to eat. Yogurt is much easier to make in this compared to my former yogurt maker, and I can make a large quantity (takes up to a gallon of milk). There is a Facebook group that offers a wealth of ideas and quick answers to questions so check that out. I have already bought more of these units to give as gifts, and I will be purchasing a second one for my home. Consider the used models- I bought one of these ""warehouse"" deals- it came in pristine condition and not sure how it was even considered used other than likely an unopened return. Cost was only 75 for that one, so a great deal. Hubby made some custom made cutting boards to put over my gas burners- because yea, not using the stove much anymore and this allows me to use the oven vent when I release pressure. Love this thing!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I mainly use the Instant Pot Duo Mini 3 qt for it's ability to pressure book since I can handle the other things it does pretty easily elsewhere.  Seems to work well, but I can see why some people don't use theirs--it does require a lot of reading, study and the real Instant Pot recipe books.  (I used the ""Instant Pot 6-ingredient"" one because it is very specific and many aren't.)  The pot does pressure cook really quickly which means you can cook faster and don't have to leave a crock pot cooking all day.  Saute-ing and then pressure cooking means that the good stuff at the bottom of the pan gets cooked into the final product which improves the taste.  If you are unsure which size you need, probably sizing up would be a good idea--for 2 people mine is adequate."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"As others have said, there is a learning curve to this. Liquid amount while cutting down recipe size is one of the biggest. I did read to start with the minimum amount of liquid and then work your way up, if needed, while learning. First time we used it my husband made a rookie mistake of pushing the start delay button after entering the cooking time which led to some frustration. He always says to me RT%M, but yet, here was a fail on his part even though he claimed to have read it. Once we moved past that road block though everything else went smoothly. Our first recipe was Indian Butter Chicken. A fork cut through the chicken just like butter. Next mashed potatoes which required a guess about liquid since we used less than 2lbs of potatoes instead of 5 lbs like the recipe called for. They turned out good, but a little wet, but as promised there were no lumps, very smooth, perfectly tender potatoes. I wished I had started with the minimum rule on the liquid as that probably would of been enough.We placed a dish drying mat underneath it to collect any water that would collect on the surface. Also decided to buy some microfiber towels to clean it after use. It cleans up very easily. The tough part was getting the anti-block shield to pop off, probably drying it first would help to get a grip on it. The sealing ring was easy to take off and on simply by pulling up and then pushing it back in after it is cleaned and dried. I think buying another sealing ring as a back up would be a good idea as I have the feeling it will be the first thing that needs to be replaced.This is a great buy for people who have busy lives and still want good, fast, and healthy food. Looking forward to trying many more dinners in our instant pot."
5.0 out of 5 stars,Makes 5 to 6 meals (I bought the medium size) so it is great for meal preppers. It needs a Tupperware seal lid so you can store it in the fridge for the week if you're not meal prepping in separate containers. Super convenient as is and very fast and no thinking or planning. Just chop and throw in the pot. It cooks very quickly and keeps the food hot/ready to eat for 10 hours so after you cook it stays fresh off the fire hot for the rest of the day. Great product!
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased this Instant Pot Mini for trying out for different recipes such as vegetables and meat.  At first I was skeptical but it did not disappoint me at all.  It is true that you may have to cook longer like 30 min. if you want chicken or roast beef to be really tender or to make meat to be shredded.  But it does work well and it is very efficient for people who have not much time.  It turned out to be that you can make various cooked meal with left over vegetables with frozen chicken or beef that you can put them in the pot to cook together within short time period.  With less oil and less amount of sodium, you can make various dishes easily.  I wanted to choose 3Qt instead of 6 Qt to make it smaller, which is also the best choice.  The only thing that I did not like was when I made rice using the instant pot.  I still like making rice out of the Japanese rice cooker that I have."
1.0 out of 5 stars,"Great pressure cooker. Easy to use and clean. Not like old fashion pressure cookers that you fear would explode or injure. This has many safety features built in that keep you from harm. There are endless amounts of recipes or even jarring uses for this too. It cuts down on cooking and wait time by hours. The food taste amazing.UPDATE 3.30.2017 I originally gave this 5 stars. But after only a handful of uses the device now seems to have  stopped functioning. It will not build up pressure. I have read numerous articles on this issue and many claim it just needs cleaning. The device is very clean and yet doesn't build up pressure. I have ruined 2 pasta dinners  after it failed to build pressure  and had to spend alot of time trying to clean the pot after it burned to the bottom of the pot. Last evening we tried it one more time cause we wanted to make cheese and grits for an office party the next day. It was late and we figured it would take 10 mins in the pressure cooker. Nope, again it failed to build pressure and burnt to the bottom of the pot.  If this device is only good for a few uses it's needs to be taken off the market."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I was introduced to this pot by my vegetarian sister and vegan nephew.  I am just starting to experiment with the multiplicity of options but it is definitely a keeper.  I cleared out my rice maker, yogurt maker and pressure cooker and could have also gotten rid of my slow cooker if I had wanted to.  I've cooked dry soy beans, dried black beans, quinoa and beets and each recipe has turned out as expected - nutritious and delicious. I have been advised to check on-line recipes in addition to the enclosed recipe book since some measurements need to be tweaked.  Buy one for yourself, give one as a gift and remember this as a winning wedding gift for domestic and foreign weddings.  It's an all round winner and clean up has been a breeze!"
1.0 out of 5 stars,"I really wanted to rate 5 stars because of how well it worked!!! Plus, best seller and top rated reviews. BUT it only lasted me 3 meals, over a 4 day time span. 3 meals that took no longer than 2 hours of total cook time. When it worked, it was quick and the food was delicious.I should've read all the 1-2 star reviews that referenced longevity. Now to look for another pressure cooker :("
4.0 out of 5 stars,"What a great little add to our instant pot! It works well, but there is definitely a learning curve - thank goodness for other people on the internet who have done the trial and error before me.My dad has a stand alone air fryer and honestly the biggest difference for us all comes down to convenience. I love that this is just a (large) extra lid for our instant pot and works immediately, he loves that he can fit an entire chicken in his. So really, it's all trade offs. If you're looking to not have yet another kitchen appliance take up space on your counter, this is the winner. If you're looking to air fry anything larger than a cornish hen, then probably look into another option."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I didn't believe I would use the Instant Pot. There are many glowing reviews, but their content boils down to ""it cooks faster"".So? When we make mashed potatoes or soak garbanzo beans for falafel, it isn't as if we spend our day hovering over the pot. We get on with our day while the water does its work.Cutting to the chase, I was wrong. Yes, this and all pressure cookers primarily just cook faster, but it is surprising how much that changes the game. Many foods no longer require planning. You can start cooking when hungry. You can cook dinner at dinner time rather than starting hours earlier.I just steamed 11 uncut potatoes (to be mashed) in 15 minutes! When making baby food, I steamed carrots and broccoli in 3 minutes of cook time!Some specific observations:- Cook times listed in various recipes do not include warm-up time and depressurization time.This isn't as significant as it sounds. The Instant Pot requires very little water to do its work, so it heats surprisingly quickly. I haven't timed it, but starting with cold tap water, it seems to take 1-5 minutes depending on the amount.- Depressurization is very easy and safe, but loud. The steam shooting out of the vent isn't particularly hot, nor is it particularly flush with moisture. On our first use, I was concerned that what appeared to be a large volume of steam would collect on the cabinets, but after a few seconds they were dry. I have no concerns about accidental steam burns because it just isn't hot enough to burn before your body can respond. I suspect the vent somehow mixes outgoing steam with cool air from the room.- Clean-up is very easy. We rarely use our food processor because there are so many parts to clean -- it's usually overall faster to chop small batches by hand. With the Instant Pot, we have only had to clean the stainless steel bowl that ships with the unit. It is dishwasher-safe, unlike many plastic food processor parts which get cloudy and brittle after repeated washes in hot detergent water, and it is surprisingly easy to clean by hand. Because of the way the cooker works, many recipes are such that food doesn't burn onto the metal surface."
5.0 out of 5 stars,I was so afraid to begin using this since I watched my mother have problems with the old-fashioned one we had when I was a small child.  I was scared to death and feared my mom's pressure cooker might explode every time she used it.  I finally decided to try mine out 3 months after I purchased it and OMG was I thrilled at how easy it is!  I made a perfect dish of country style pork ribs.  It was so tender and I had no need of a knife when I had dinner.  The meat was perfectly cooked and my fear of pressure cookers diminished!  Now I'm eagerly deciding what I'll cook next.  This is a wonderful addition to my kitchen and now I wish I'd purchased it a lot sooner.  It has cut way down on cook time and now my repertoire is growing.  There are so many recipes I plan on trying.  This is so easy to operate and I'm just so glad I decided to spoil myself a bit by buying it.  I'm an empty-nester and find it difficult to scale back on meal-sizes but I'm getting better at it and I think this size is perfect for my needs.  I'm able to freeze portions and I'm set for the future with pre-made meals thanks to my freezer.  I was surprised to see how easy clean-up is.  I just can't say enough positives about this amazing small appliance!  This would be a perfect gift so I'm looking forward to the next occasion I'll need a gift for.  Just made shopping way easier too!
1.0 out of 5 stars,"We've tried, over and over, because we have friends who have instantpots who whip out amazing meals in no time, and they love it. Ours, I believe, is a lemon. At first I thought it was me (for some reason), even though I'm a veteran in the kitchen (bake my own bread every week, home cooked meals 5 nights/week, bbq, smoke, roasts, etc- i LOVE food and i LOVE cooking). We've tried 6 recipes so far in our instant pot, a couple of those recipes had multiple attempts so have used it about 10 times, and EVERYTIME it displays a ""BURN"" message before the valve rises. I've tested multiple times with just water and no problem - everything operates as it should. But whether its meat, vegetables, rice, or ANYTHING solids at all, our unit displays the ""BURN"" message before the valve rises.Unfortunately, we've owned our unit beyond what Amazon will allow for returns/exchanges (but after reading other reviews I will try calling them and explaining our situation).We've called InstantPot twice....only to wait on hold for more than 30 minutes each time before calling it quits and hanging up. Emailed- no response.I really just think the particular unit we received is a lemon because of all of our friends who swear by theirs, so all I want is a replacement since it has only been 4 months since ordering ours, but instantpot is unreachable so I guess I'll be calling Amazon. Hoping the seller sees this comment and can help us expedite this process."
3.0 out of 5 stars,"On its face, seems simple:  choose what you are cooking and it should be automatic, but it is far more complicated than that.  First, you never know what you are going to get when you chose one of the preset options (e.g., ""porridge"" - how long?  does that involve pressure?  when will I be able to open it?).  The most annoying thing about cooking with this pot is that you NEVER know how long it will take.  Even if you used it before with the same settings, it could take longer to heat up this time, and then if you are using pressure, you don't know how long it will take to cool down enough to reach a safe pressure for opening (yeah, when the release pops, but WHEN will that be?), which makes it extremely difficult to plan a meal time.  Oh, and I love how this is marketed to ""put everything in the pot, set it, and forget it -- it will cook when the timer is up and the meal will be ready when you get home, etc.""  How can you do this with anything that has MEAT in it and be sure it will be safe to eat?!  Also, clean up can be a pain since half the time stuff burns to the bottom (it gets extremely hot on the bottom, while the top can still be freezing!).  This leads to the big question of HOW MUCH WATER to add?!  Supposedly, the pressure option will seal so you don't lose water, but since you never know WHEN that will happen, you have no idea how much water to add-- too much, and you have soup instead of stew, too little, and stuff burns to the bottom.  We have tried many of the included recipes, as well as some from the internet, and some have worked well and others haven't, but the main issue is there has been no consistency, so what worked before doesn't necessarily work the second or third time.  It has been a guessing game from the start, and still is (we've had this now for probably 2 years).  Haven't yet tried to make yogurt, but I want to give that a try to see how the low and slow works -- maybe we'll have better luck with that..."
2.0 out of 5 stars,"I received my IP 4 days ago and used it for the first time today. Mind you I didnt cook anything big, I just boiled some pasta and made some chicken alfredo. I washed the inner pot and it looked like I cooking regularly on it it for 6 months. At this point I dont even know if it's safe to cook from. I'm not sure what material it's made of but it looks partially rusted. Before anyone come for me I used a silicone spoon and I DID NOT use harsh sponge. Very disappointed. At this point I just want to send the whole damn pot back because this should not be."
1.0 out of 5 stars,Absolute crap. Used it twice and the sensor broke. Had the insurance and everything and they still won't replace it.
3.0 out of 5 stars,"I wanted this to make homemade yogurt, which it does well.  But for other types of cooking there are some limitations.  The slow cooker function isn't warm enough to actually cook the food.  The guide for dry beans was 25 minutes of pressure cooking and that wasn't enough, as they were still hard when the cycle finished.  This morning I did some oatmeal for 3 minutes on high pressure, based on the included guide, and a ""burn"" error message came up.  If the unit can recognize a burn, it should appropriately turn down the heat!  I have a nice sturdy stovetop pressure cooker and two crock pots and thought this could replace both, but no."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I gave a larger version of this to my daughter for Christmas and have wanted this smaller one for a long time. I looked a so many other brands before I decided on this one. I'm sure there are others that are good, but this is the newer version and had an additional safety feature that I appreciated. It is perfect for preparing meals for one or two people with lots of leftovers! At first, I thought it would be hard to figure out how to use, but once I plunged in and cooked dry beans without soaking overnight, I was hooked. It is not hard at all to use and very safe. Just read the steps provided in the manual and one or two practices makes perfect. It is so nice that it came with an extra silicone ring for the lid too."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"The biggest problem with this appliance is the slow-cooker function, which simply doesn't get hot enough. I was hoping I could get rid of my old slow-cooker and replace it with this, but I've found that even on high, the Instant Pot can't maintain already bubbling food at a simmer and doesn't work at all to cook meat, beans, or soup over an extended period. It's frustrating, because if the slow cooker temperature were about ten degrees hotter, the Instant Pot would be close to perfect. I love that I can use Saute to brown meat, then use the pressure cooker function to cook it into pot roast, all in the one pot with easy clean-up. Although I know other people swear by it as a rice cooker, I find it's just about as fast and easy to make rice on the stovetop, but for cooking beans, it's an absolute winner. All in all, its low slow-cooking temperature really limits its usefulness, but it's still worth having as a pressure cooker."
1.0 out of 5 stars,"I am an experienced cook.  Bought the 3 quart mini, accessory package, and cookbook.  I’ve tried over the last few months to use this pot—for rice, potatoes,,stews,chili, etc.  I just don’t get good results.  For example, I cook brown rice, white rice, quinoa, arborita, etc.  First you have to find on the internet how much rice and liquid—it’s different for each variety, and it’s different from the standard directions on the box.  You must program the time, and the amount of pressure. Then you have to determine whether to let it sit and naturally release pressure or immediately start bleeding off the pressure. You don’t know if it’s overdone and stuck to the pan or underdone and tough until you’ve completed the cycle and opened the pot.  Then it’s too late.  My cooking results have just been too unpredictable.  Old dog new tricks?  Maybe, but I’m giving it all away.  I really don’t recommend."
1.0 out of 5 stars,"For months my mother has been telling me that she doesn't like to use her instant pot, which is crazy to me bc I love mine & use it all the time. When I finally visit I come to find out that Amazon sent her a broken unit! There's a black sharpied 'X' on both the label & the top of the unit, but my mother has never worked retail so she didn't know what that meant. I tested some tried and true recipes and they came out about 2/3 cooked. Its too late to return her unit, so instead I warn the rest of you. Just go buy an instant pot at any grocery store, they're the same price they are on Amazon. Then at least you can hold them accountable if they sell you something knowingly broken."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Purchasing this Instant Pot Lid has increased what I can do with the Instant po tremendously.Like all other Instany Pot items, this arrived in sturdy packaging, safely, and with everything in the box.The item feels durable and quality and sets on top of the IP nicely.I saw the IP Air Fryer but I have limited space. This is a perfect option because I have all the options of their air fryer now with this compact lid.The air fryer basket fits snuggly in the stainless steel pot so the space you have to air fry is just a little shallower than the SS pot.I highly recommend purchasing this."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I never want to be without the InstantPot or this AirFryer lid again.. these two appliances have changed my life. However, after one month of use the AirFryer lid stopped working. I tried reaching out to InstantPot for help before returning my fryer lid but was on hold for almost an hour before I decided to contact Amazon.com to initiate a return. Luckily, today was that last day before the return window closed.. I will definitely get another but I am sad to have to go through this process."
2.0 out of 5 stars,"There is nothing instant about this product. This is a hyped up gimmick that will fade just like other ""quick"" fixes. It lasted From Dec to March, barely 3 months and I don't think I used it more than 15 times. It just died. Absolute waste of time and effort.Very disappointing.EDIT:I am bumping up my 1 star rating to 2 because Instant Pot replaced the defective one with a brand new product and that is good on them, just to note they told me the new one will only have warranty for 90 days versus the regular warranty! Either way, I wouldn't but another product from them."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I finally broke down a few months ago and bought a 6 qt. I loved it. I am constantly using it. Here is the rub. We are combining our household of my mom, husband and me with our daughters family of 6 into a very large house starting this summer. The six qt will not make enough. So I just bought the ten. Except for the lid not being able to rest in the handle it is perfect. Accessories are scarce right now but I’m sure they will start flowing. Also you should plan on buying a larger trivet by a third party because the one that comes with it is way too small."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is the most complete I've ever bought. I've had owned several pressure cookers in the past, some of them doing a good job but this one by far is the best one ever. My complaints with pressure cookers were that at some point the flavor of the food was lost and also I had to use a pan to sauté for seasoning the meat, beans etc. With this one is different, you sauté your condiments, mix with the meats, beans, etc and forget about your meal. In just a few minutes it would be ready, leaving you with a delicious, nutritive meal"
4.0 out of 5 stars,"So we've used it a handful of times, and it's pretty good.  Food does cook faster, and the flavors/textures have been more than acceptable.  However, it takes a while to pressurize...I think this is because I got the 8qt version.  I got the larger size because when making soups we like to have some leftovers, but when not making soup it takes 10-20 minutes to start the timer.  Factor that in and it's just not a huge timesaver, unless I'm making something that'd usually cook a lot longer.  I was really hoping that the Instant Pot would help out with getting dinner made for the kids when we bring them home from school, but it's just not quick enough for that."
3.0 out of 5 stars,"I feel compelled to average my rating for the hardware (5 stars) and the instruction booklets that came with it (zero stars) so I am generously giving the package three stars.  There are components (condensate collector) that are mentioned briefly as to what they are, but not at all when they are to be used.  The most egregious shortcoming, and one that will flummox an inexperienced pressure cooker user, is that the cook time chart is totally worthless.  I would respectfully submit to Instant Pot that a DVD showing the different modes of operation and how to properly use the pressure release, keep-warm time, reprogramming of the specific food buttons (rice, beans, etc) and showing use of each of the specific features would be a great improvement, and would greatly flatten the learning curve.  The Instant Pot is a versatile, nearly foolproof cooker and has many truly great features.  But the instruction book should have the pages perforated so they could be used elsewhere."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"I love my Instant Pot. It does an excellent job doing saute and pressure cooking. But don't get it if you need something that also does slow cooking. The highest temperature of slow cooking is more like low. It is very rare that I'm able to get any of my slow cooker recipes to work in my Duo Nova. It's rather frustrating since I really wanted an all-in-one. That said, if you don't need it to act like a slow cooker, it's an excellent pot and I highly recommend it."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Seriously, the Instant Pot is the greatest kitchen tool I've ever bought! I also bought the I.P. Air Fryer Lid and a regular I.P. lid. The pasta is excellent - add pasta (penne), cover with water, Pessure Cook for 3-mins and Natural Release for 2-mins - real al dente. Do the same for rice Fun noodles (thick) - perfect - so easy.I also steam canned fig jam (plus boiled my jars), made lovely roasted chicken quaters (with the added surprise of getting perfect gelatinous stock from the drippings), Pressure Cooked chocolate brownies (perfect), made spaghetti sauce, and perfectly cooked grains - farro, wheat berries, buckwheat- it's only been a month.Very small learning curve, but there's plenty of online help and it's easy to experiment.Get the 6-quart if you're going to get the fryer lid too.Thank you, Instant Pot!"
3.0 out of 5 stars,"I have had this instant pot for almost two years now, and most of the issues I had were within the first six months. Twice the sealing ring stopped working properly and the Instant Pot would not pressurize properly as a result. This was extremely frustrating, and though customer service did end up sending replacements both times, the process was tedious. I had to send in videos describing the issue and showing the process with the Instant Pot. Looking online it was clear to me this is not an uncommon issue. If you are fortunate enough to receive a unit that doesn’t break within the warranty period, the product itself is fine. I found most recipes tailored for the Instant Pot are usually not very healthy, with some exceptions. I do not use it often anymore as I have found that it does not shave off that much cooking time, though this will depend on what type of foods you choose to cook."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I finally jumped on this Instant Pot craze after reading an article about being able to make wine in it. I received a model for Christmas and took it back because it didn't have the function needed to make wine and purchased this model.Well, the wine cooked like it was supposed to. It is still fermenting in the bottle so the real test will come in a few weeks when it is ready for sampling.As for cooking food, I cannot believe I waited so long to buy an Instant Pot. Where has this been all my life? I don't know if I will ever go back to using my stove. It is so easy to use and seriously cooks food in a fraction of the time. I made a roast with potatoes and carrots in 40 minutes! That would have taken all day in a slow cooker or several hours in the oven! And frozen chicken-12 minutes. 12 MINUTES!Now I will say, it is a bit bulky and takes up some counter space, but really the awesomeness of this thing outweighs that. The pressure release also scares my dog a bit, but she scares easily anyway so I make sure to give her calming treats before I use it. I really don't have anything else bad to say about this. If you are looking for a simple and easy way to make dinner, this is what you need."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"I have used the IPot weekly since I purchased it several months ago.  One of my fav uses is to make soups/stews of all types from Potato Bacon to Chicken Cacciatore.  Very easy since you go from saute mode to pressure cook in the same pot.  When it comes to cooking meats like a chuck pot roast or a pork shoulder, this IPot is big enough to do a 6# roast with ease.  From pot roast to whole chicken to beef shortribs, you cannot beat the flavor it produces as the pressure keeps the flavors and juices locked in.For the few dollars more, get the 8 qt and enjoy super tasty leftovers and a freezer full of delicious nutritious soups/stews."
1.0 out of 5 stars,"This lid is a joke! You cook your food in your pressure cooker, then put the lid on, preheat it for 30 minutes! WHAT?? Then brown your already cooked food.to bake you once again preheat for 30 minutes then bake for at least 40 minutes more!I returned it! I'll stick to my regular air fryer it's way faster and my food comes out perfectly cooked"
3.0 out of 5 stars,"We aren't pleased with this slow cooker. We believe it is a very fine product but the requirements for programing it for by a senior citizen make using the slow cooker problematic. We are not complaining about the Instant Pot Instant Pot DUO60 6 Qt 7-in-1 Multi-Use Programmable Pressure Cooker, Slow Cooker but it is not for us. PLease advise as to the return of this product.Thank you. Thomas Cole"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I wanted to double check the exact model of IP I own before buying an accessory for it and released that I have owned it for close to 5 years and decided it was time to write a review. I love my Instant Pot. I own a traditional pressure cooker that I rarely used because I felt like I need to constantly watch it, so I was reluctant to invest in an IP. I am so glad I did. I have used my IP at least twice a week since I bought it and sometime 3 or 4. I have done everything from cook hard boiled eggs, cook ribs, to bake a cheesecake. I almost never use my dedicate slower cooker, because I can brown meat right in the IP and use the SC setting.My most used accessories are the steamer basket, spring form pan (meatloaf), extra liner and extra sealing ring. The least used is the hard boiled egg steamer rack (the steamer basket holds a lot more and is easier to use).I have since given an IP to my sister, mother, and a niece, plus several of my favorite accessories.If my IP died tomorrow, I would feel certain that I had more than gotten my money's worth and immediately buy another."
1.0 out of 5 stars,"It came scratched and the directions are not all that clear.  I ultimately returned this due to the scratches and didn't repurchase because of the lack of clear directions.  This can be a dangerous product so I feel the directions need to be very clear.  also note this is HUGE.  I have a large kitchen, but this would not fit anywhere, including in any cupboard.  It is nearly 15"" tall."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I got this Instant Pot for myself for Christmas and I love, love, love it. I use it everyday. I use it to  cook whole meals. It's so easy.Just put the food in with the water in the bottom, if  pressure cooking, then press a button, select the time and that's it. It's so fast and easy and clean up is a breeze. It's quiet and there's no watching it or having to adjust heat or anything. Yesterday I put spaghetti in the IP, covered it with about 1 1/2 "" of water, put a trivet with legs on it, on top of the spaghetti, then  set a dish of frozen meat balls with  sauce on the trivet, closed the lid, pressed the pressure button and set timer for 8 min. After 8 minutes I released the steam and It came out perfect.Every day I'm trying to think of another recipe to experiment with."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"We're going through a kitchen renovation right now and currently our ""kitchen"" is in the garage and the backyard grill. Unfortunately, it's also getting up to 100 degrees outside most days - kinda like cooking in Hell's Kitchen (like actual hell, not the Gordon Ramsey yelling at you Hell). This Instant Pot has been a HUGE lifesaver - allowing me to cook all of our faves like pot roast, spaghetti, tacos, shrimp scampi, teriyaki chicken, etc., with minimal effort, in half the time, and without having to stand outside in the heat. I swear it seems like a magical pot - every single thing I've made in here has turned out better than if I had cooked it on the stovetop or in the oven. It's very forgiving. If you enter the wrong time and things aren't as ""done"" as you'd like, you can easily fix it with some of the other functions like saute or leaving the lid on for a few minutes more while you wait and sip your wine. Where has this dang pot been all my life?! Get this Instant Pot - you won't regret it...unless it spontaneously combusts like one of the other reviewers said - nothing like that has happened to me so far and I use mine A LOT."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Got this as a present (GREAT black friday sale!!!) for my friend; a single mom with 3 kids. Wow, she has been so happy with it! She's a vegetarian and this really helps her prepare foods to suit her diet and desires. She also works all day, so being able to slow cook all day or pressure cook quickly is a real treat. I have one of these too (not a vegetarian) and I love that I can saute meats and veggies, such as before making a stew. The pot is also super easy to use and VERY safe. The outside of the pot does not get hot, ever. The inner pot gets hot, but not around the upper rim! I told my friend that her 10 year old son could probably learn to use the instant pot. As a mom, she was worried about the steam release from pressure cooking, but she didn't need to be. I can literally put my hand within 6"" of the steam pressure release and it's cool, not hot. In my own instant pot, I've made chicken and pork masala over rice, pulled pork, bbq beef brisket with onion (for sandwiches), baked potatoes, steamed veggies, juicy beef and venison stews, chicken soup, and an absolutely delicious split pea soup with ham hocks...it's all easy. And you can make your own yogurt, which I do plan to try (someday.) This is such a great way to ensure you get a hot, healthy, filling meal to suit your desires... whether you live alone or have a large family, or have lots of time or barely any time. Cheers!!!"

5.0 out of 5 stars,"Apart from my countertop oven I use for baking and toasting this is my most used appliance. In fact my Zojirushi rice cooker sits collecting dust now that I know how to make rice in this thing. I use it for cooking a package of brats for example no more guessing if the center is raw on the stove. 1.5 cups of water, brats, and 10 minutes and I know they'll be cooked! I also use it to cook brown rice in under 30 minutes where as before it took my Zojirushi around 2 hours to do. I'll also make things such as Rice+Veggies+Shrimp in the same pot and comes out great! I ended up getting the transparent lid and stickfree inner pot for rice. Not much to say than this device is super simple to use once you get used to it.Appliance of the gods!"
4.0 out of 5 stars,"I was intimidated at first, and the instant pot sat in the box for a week.  After finding a random youtube video I realized how easy it was and wasn't hesitant to try it.  There were some simple instructions in the box but that wasn't nearly as valuable as seeing the steps.  (For example: The display screen says ""on"" while pressure is building, during the set cook time the timer counts backwards, and after the item is cooked the display counts forward until turned off, while just keeping the food warm)  I still sometimes have a hard time understanding all the display symbols but haven't invested much time in looking through the manual.My pressure release button is wiggly, although that's apparently normal.  Sometimes I have to hold it in place for a quick release because it doesn't stay on its own.  I wish the valve were more stable in the two positions instead of feeling like it's always about to break off.Overall, I use it multiple times a week and it earns its keep in my cupboard space."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have friends who have been talking about the Instant Pot, so I decided to try it out! We purchased the 3-qt Instant Pot Duo Nova a couple months ago and really like cooking with it! It's convenient to saute your meats and vegetables and then pressure cook your food in the same pot. I often hear how some people are fearful of pressure cooking. I found that the newer Instant Pots now have the pressure release button located away from the release valve so there would be less chance of getting scalded from the steam that is being released.We've watched several YouTube videos in order to discover new recipes from Instant Potters like Sandy Clifton, pressure luck and Six Sisters Stuff. While the 3-qt pot was sufficient for cooking for my wife and me, I've found that most of the recipes on YouTube are geared more towards 6-qt or larger. Because of that, we have since purchased the 6-qt Instant Pot Duo Nova, which this review is about. It is similar to the 3 qt size, but of course is heavier and takes up a little more space on the counter!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is a quality product. My complaint is that it's not instant really. The paper that comes in it boasting of the miniscule cooking times for a variety of foods is misleading as, probably due to volume variables between users, they only include the active cooking time. It doesnt factor in the 10+minutes of coming to pressure or the 3 minute quick release or even longer (20+ minutes) natural depressurization. You're looking at 30 minutes in many cases rather than 3, and often considerably more. That said, some processes that do genuinely take a long time using typical methods are much quicker, such as whole chickens, dry beans, & roasts. This helps produce tender meat from less tender cuts so is good there. Also, you can brown a frozen 1.5 pound block of ground venison in it quicker than defrosting it and browning it in a pan. Rice takes longer in this than on the stove once the pre and final pressures are achieved, and no one in their right mind is going to want it for veggies that can be warmed up in 1 to 5 minutes with conventional equipment. As for soups, it appears to be ideal, however some ingredients lose their desired texture under the pressure required to cook the meat portion. Many recipes say to add things that require less cooking later in the process but that starts the pressurizing clock all over again. Not cool. Just be sure you need it for truly time consuming or tough cut products or that like me you often forget to set meat out of the freezer in time to thaw for dinner before investing. It does pasturize milk, make yogurt, seal jars and slow cook. I tried to make stock using the broth setting but was unsatisfied with the outcome, as it did not gel as it should. I tried to slow cook chicken leg quarters and after 6 hours the one on top was still cool to the touch and none were cooked."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I hate cooking so I've spent decades eating take out, microwave dinners or just baking chicken with vegetables. My poor kids grew up having to fend for themselves. That's how much I really do hate cooking. I made a lot of baked chicken and both my daughters are now vegan. They didn't grow up with a mother who taught them to cook or bake. I had my girls believing that only professional bakers could make a round layered cake but eventually, like Santa Claus and the tooth fairy they found out that people could and did make layer cakes. I was busted.There are no words to describe how much I hate cooking so I decided I'd try an instant pot. It was normally $120 and I got it for $64 on Black Friday. If I didn't like it, I'd send it to my daughter. I've always loved Indian food but for someone who hates cooking as much as I do, making Indian food is way too much work. Then I made an Indian dinner in my instant pot and it was delicious. My husband loves to cook and I will admit he was more than a little nervous with just me and a pressure cooker in our kitchen. He grabbed our dog and locked himself in his office. An hour later, he's shocked as he's eating delicious cumin chicken. It tasted like it came from a restaurant and the stainless steel pot, lid and other accessories went right into the dishwasher. I bought a taller trivet so that I could make the basmati rice in the pot with the curry and chicken. Just like some people could spend the rest of their lives eating American food, I could easily eat Indian food for the rest of my life so I have a couple Indian cookbooks. There are plenty of healthy dinners with minimal fat and plenty of nutrients. I've been using my instant pot at least 3X/week since I make enough for leftovers. With my ninja chopper, prep's a breeze. I mix the dry spices together beforehand so they're ready to be put in. I can use all kinds of veggies and I usually use chicken breast, turkey breast or tofu. Fish comes out nicely cooked as well. Making the rice with dinner is very convenient. I've not tried cakes or yogurt but I'm going to try some Indian desserts. I actually convinced the owner of the Indian grocery to get an instant pot and she loves it.It's easy to use once you've read the manual. I wish I had this when my girls were young. For me, it's the best thing to come along since microwave ovens. If you really don't like cooking and/or you want dinner that can be made quickly, you'll love the instant pot. There is supposedly an air fryer attachment that fits the 6 qt pot but I doubt I'd use it. I have bought a few accessories. The way I figured it, our bar bill at a restaurant costs more than $64. It's already paid for itself. If you hate cooking as much as I do or you want dinner on the table quicker than traditional baking, frying, grilling, etc, I'd recommend the 8 qt for a larger family. You really don't need to buy a lid since you probably already have lids from pots and pans that will work just as well. I love my instant pot! It is big so consider that if your counter space is limited. I keep mine on a shelf in our pantry."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have only had it for a week and  have been gone for part of that time.  I have only cooked rice and hard cooked eggs, so far.  Liked the quantity of rice I did and it was quick and easy and good.  Loved the eggs as they came out cooked perfectly with no black ring and even though they were fresh from my girls, they peeled much more easily than normal cooking.  Will be trying out some other recipes as things settled down.  But I am happy with the size as I cook for just myself and can see it will keep me from cooking too much as I continue to struggle with cooking family sized meals and having too much food.  I just bought the 100 recipes for the Instapot mini and am looking forward to trying them out as they are perfect quantities.  I am also looking forward to making yogurt and soups.  I have used the old fashioned pressure cookers for 50 years.  I had a huge one I use for canning.  But this new style will be so easy to use and smaller than the other three pots I have.  I think it is a good purchase."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"After my Vita Mix, I'd have to say this is my next favorite kitchen appliance now. It's EASY to clean (yay!), it's easy to operate, and it doesn't heat up the kitchen. I had never used a pressure cooker before (and neither did my mom, so I didn't grow up around them), so I was nervous about all the horror stories that float around about beans on the ceiling, etc. Not to worry; they have engineered this so that you can't get the lid off unless all the pressure has been released. If you're considering buying this item, take a look on youtube for Instant Pot videos; there's lots of them available, and you'll quickly learn how versatile it is, and how much everyone loves it. I use this so much that I keep it on the counter (along with my Vita Mix). I would recommend the Instant Pot whole heartedly!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This review is for the IP I purchased on 12/1, which lasted one month. I loved it while it worked. Today after years of not making a fully loaded soup I decided to make. Purchased all the ingredients and plugged it in. It was DEAD. I tried another outlet and nothing. I checked some reviews with a 1 rating and this seems to happen on occasions. I am still under the Amazon replacement program, so I will go ahead and order another one. I am doing it because I bought on sale for $50 and it seems that I did get one of the few lemons. That should not happen, though. Once I get my replacement, I will rate that purchase hopefully with 5 stars. I also had purchased several accessories that I do not want to waste.Edited 6/20/20. I did get my replacement from Amazon, as usual amazing customer service. It appears that I had the misfortune to get a lemon. The replacement is excellent, it works flawlessly and I love using it. I regret that I did not keep the 2 booklets that came with the first one that were much better than the ones that came with the replacement. Interesting that I forgot to include the 2 white spoons and the replacement did not include the 2 spoons. What amazes me is that it was shipped before they received the replacement just as soon as UPS logged it in. Anyway I am very happy with this IP and Amazon's amazing service."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love it - it's an Instant Pot, love it or hate it.  This size is great for cooking for a few people, making side dishes, batches of yogurt, batch of real steel cut oatmeal for the week.  Great for buffet dishes - keep your chili warm,  hot spiced cider, or make fondue for a party, make caramel, dulce de leche, fudge sauce, simmer soup using the slow cooker feature without fear of burning - accurate temperature control, timer, Keep Warm feature. The features are great, read the booklet and it's easy to use, watch the videos or join the Facebook page.  Very easy to clean - I recommend ordering extra sealing rings, they can pick up smells, and who wants oatmeal that has a hint of pot roast?  I also bought the glass lid to use with the slow cooking features."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"So many things can be cooked in this Instant Pot but even the simplest things like rice, taste better than my old steamer. All I really needed was a steamer but the first one I ordered came dented and I decided it was time to try pressure cooking. If you have a family, you should consider a larger pot, but my husband and I do not require more than what the mini has to offer.Excellent quality and cleans up easily. I found a website where a couple tests out different times and pressure release methods on each recipe. I also bought 3 Kindle versions of vegetarian recipe books (.99 each!) because there is a lot of focus on meat in the book that comes with cooker.It's a real time saver and takes the ""fear"" out of pressure cooking!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I’ve used an instant pot before, and I really enjoyed the versatility of the machine. I didn’t, however, want a giant appliance to take up so much room in my kitchen. This appliance is the perfect size, and makes just what I need for one meal for a family of 3-4. So far, I’ve used it to make wild rice, white rice, rice pudding, a turkey breast, stew, roast, chicken tikka masala, and risotto. Follow directions and you will have no problems. It has been easy to use,  and there are a million recipes for Instant Pot out there for you. Do note that you don’t need the preset buttons for much of anything. Most recipes give you a direct cooking time, so it is easy peasy.  We also got the nonstick liner, which means that we can actually make two separate pressure cooker recipes for one meal with no cleaning in between. That has proven to be even more convenient!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"So far, I love this pressure cooker. So far, I have used it only once to make beef tips. I used grass fed round steak, that is a little more tricky than beef from the store. Grass fed beef has much less fat. So it has to be cooked at lower temperature, and works best with moist heat. Prior to getting this pressure cooker, I have been using the MaxiMatic EPC-808 Elite Platinum 8-Quart Pressure Cooker, and have been very happy with the results, but there have been a couple of things that could have been better. In this review, I will compare the Instant Pot and the MaxiMatic pressure cooker from my observations to-date. - The Instant Pot has a tri-ply stainless insert and the MaxiMatic has a non-stick insert - In the time that I have had the MaxiMatic pressure cooker, the non-stick insert has become less effective. Even though foods don't stick to the insert, it gets stains that are really difficult to remove. The Instant Pot is so easy to clean with a stainless cleaner, and nothing really sticks to it. So cleanup is so much easier. - The MaxiMatic has one setting for browning meats (brown rice) with no adjustments for simmer. So if you want to make gravy from a roast, it boils and you have to turn it off to reduce the heat. The Instant Pot has the Sauté function for browning, but the temperature can be set to low, medium, or high. So something like gravy can be simmered on the low setting.- When cooking foods that must be entered into the cooking process at different time, such as cooking a pot roast and adding veggies later, the sealing ring in the MaxiMatic must be reseated each time you open the cooker. This can be a real pain when the top of the cooker is hot. The sealing ring in the Instant Pot stays put. It doesn't have to be reseated each time you open the cooker.From my point of view, one downside of the Instant Pot is that you have to choose a function and then adjust the cook time from there. With the MaxiMatic, you don't need to ever use the functions if you don't want to. You can set the unit to pressure cook at whatever time you want. So there is more manual flexibility. I don't think this is a major issue because you can set the time on the Instant Pot after you select a function. You also have the option of high or low pressure that you don't have on the MaxiMatic pressure cooker.In summary, I prefer the stainless insert of the Instant Pot over the non-stick insert of the MaxiMatic cooker. I also prefer the flexibility of the three temperature setting for the Sauté function of the Instant Pot over the high setting of the MaxiMatic pot using the brown rice setting. I was a little concerned about the lower PSI max of the Instant Pot because it is 10 PSI vs. the 12 PSI of the Maximatic, but so far this hasn't been a problem. The only consideration might be a slightly increased allowance for cook time. At least so far, this hasn't proven to be a major concern.UPDATE 11/22/16I had bought the 6 quart Instant Pot in July of 2014. At that time, the 8 quart Instant Pot was not available so I bought a different brand because I use the 8 quart pressure cooker the most. When the other brand would not attain pressure in the middle of making a meal, I used another 8 quart pot that I had to finish the meal. My backup pot has a non-stick pot so I don't really like it. When I saw that Amazon was offering an 8 quart Instant Pot, I bought it immediately. The night I got it, I made braised beef short ribs, and they came out so tender and flavorful. What I noticed was that no steam was lost from the Instant Pot once it attained pressure. I had made these short ribs and cooked them for the same amount of time in my old cooker. In the old one, they were still tough and not cooked enough. Using the Instant Pot they were perfect. The old cooker had a display that showed the pressure as it went up and down, and this cooker does not have that. I did like this display because, on a slow release of pressure, I could see when the pressure was down enough to open the cooker. On this cooker, you just have to let it sit for 15 minutes and then quick release the remaining pressure. I also like that this cooker has markers for open and close on the rim that help in aligning the cover to close it. This cooker also has all of the features I described previously for the 6 quart cooker. On other feature that is worth mentioning is that the cover can be held in the handles on either side of the pot after you open it. With my old pot, I had to put the cover in the sink and dripped condensation on the floor to get there. It is so much more convenient and less messy to set the cover up on one of the handles so condensation drips back into the pot. It also keeps the cover handy for times when you add veggies later and have to put the cover back on it to pressure cook added veggies.Considering all, the Instant Pot pressure cooker is my favorite of the brands I have tried, and I would highly recommend it. Hopefully it lasts longer the the 1 1/2 years that my old cooker lasted. If not, I will update this review, but I would definitely replace it with another of the same."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I went back and forth over buying this for a long time. I worried that we wouldn’t get that much use out of it because we don’t eat meat and it looked like a lot of the meals I was seeing being cooked in these were meat based. I was still curious so I decided to go ahead and buy it and I’m glad I did! I like it a lot and we use it often. Some of the cooking times can be misleading because you have to wait for it to come to pressure before the “cook time” starts. I’ve read that takes a long time for some people but luckily we haven’t had that experience. Overall it does save a lot of my time because it’s hands-off cooking. I put the ingredients in, turn it on, and then I can walk away and do something else. I don’t have to stay there and stir or watch the food cook.Some of my favorite things to cook in it are risotto, quinoa, oatmeal, beans, sweet potatoes, and curry. It’s good for easy, one-pot meals. We put quinoa or rice and water on the bottom and then add a bunch of veggies on top, pressure cook for 1 minute for quinoa and 4 minutes for rice and have a really quick and easy meal that tastes great.My only complaint is that some vegetables are too delicate for the instant pot and they turn to mush. Broccoli for example, even being in there for 1 minute turns way too soft for my liking. To fix this we cook whatever it is we are cooking and then when it’s done we add the broccoli and put the lid back on with the instant pot turned off or on the keep warm setting for a few minutes. That seems to cook the broccoli just enough that it is bright green but still crisp the way I like it.I also appreciate the safety features. I was scared of pressure cookers before lol. My parents had a stovetop one that I would never use because I had heard stories of them exploding. I feel like the instant pot is really safe because you can’t open the lid when it’s under pressure even if you tried. It’s locked.It also makes a cute noise when you put the lid on and take it off.Overall I really like this thing! I’m excited to try making yogurt in it and see what other meals we can come up with. It is worth the cabinet space it takes up."
1.0 out of 5 stars,After few use the lid stared to jam. It was impossible to open and I applied force which created a crack. This could well be a defective item but I’ve been going back and forth with the support team who just keep requesting information. Unfortunately I’ve had a bad experience with this product.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Yeah, I'm now on the Instant Pot bandwagon!  My dad sent me the larger 6 qt. for Christmas, but for my family of two, it was too large.  The 3 qt is the perfect size for me and my husband, and I get maybe 4-6 servings per recipe.  I'd buy this just to make risotto, honestly.  It was SO FRICKIN EASY TO MAKE.  I'm obsessed.  I have also made chili mac, soup, lentil sloppy joes, and a Thai noodle dish that ended up spurting peanut sauce everywhere.  I've had no issues converting the 6 qt recipes to the 3 qt - just make sure you don't go below or past the liquid lines.  The Instant Pot is very easy to use and easy to clean up.  I recommend buying the plastic lid so you can keep your meals in the fridge if you don't put them in containers.  I live in a small NYC apartment and this fits easily in a cabinet - doesn't take up much space at all."
2.0 out of 5 stars,"I have been cooking for 40 years and I love a new tool.  I just got the instapot and am having great fun with it.  SO, I thought i would try the air fryer.  YUCK!!!  the instapot with its pressure cook fits a ton of food.  when you need to spread it out to air fry not so much fits in the pot.Things don't fry in air so you need to oil them up.  That means a cooking spray with its propellents or , what i did, brushing oil on.  Halfway through you are instructed to move things around.  MESSY.. now i need a plate to put the rack insert and its drippings on and to reach in and everything is stuck to the bottom and flip and move and turn.  This is not an easy task and why bother.I suppose if you are really opposed to oil frying or you simply cannot get out for fried chicken you might give it a try.  BUt why?  cook in the oven, my oven baked fries covered in a garlic butter are easy to make, easy to clean up after and better than what I did in this pain in the neck contraption.  Its HuGE to store and very tall so short people like me, well, not so easy to see the buttons.All that said i returned it because cheap it was not.  But, i will try again if I ever get out on my boat for a month and don't want the heat of the stove.  I wont are fry but will use it like an oven.  It has a bake and broil setting so perhaps... or maybe something designed to air fry?  I see people loving it but not me."
1.0 out of 5 stars,"Lid stopped holding pressure 11 months after purchase. I did get square trade, and submitted a claim, they want me to contact company first. I think we need to give clear instructions on what does it mean to get square trade. It needs to say that it covers 2-5 years after company warranty expires. I feel like I am given run around. At the time of purchase I assumed it was 0-4 years. Beware."
1.0 out of 5 stars,"I’m bummed! I must have gotten a dud, but I’m so frustrated, I give up! I’m returning the Instant Pot Duo Nova. I tried 7 times to boil eggs... I could not get them cooked. I tried the 5-5-5 method on high pressure. Then I added time on 1 egg at a time until I got 1 good egg at 7 minutes. Put 6 eggs in at once using 7-5-5, not one cooked egg! I am so disappointed in this appliance. Guess I’ll stick the old fashioned cooking on the stove, oven, and grill."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love that it just adds to an appliance I already have, one less big appliance on my countertop. It doesn’t leave a mess on my counter like my old air fryer. It is very easy to clean. I don’t like the small size basket and the non stick coating is starting to peel after 2 uses. I bought some accessories and another air fry basket made by a 3rd party to fit the instant pot 6 qt duo. It works perfectly. It cooks better than my old Power XL air fryer. The fan is very quiet. The instant pot air fryer is less expensive than other air fryers, unless you don’t already have the instant pot pressure cooker. It’s amazing!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've had this about a month and I love it.  I want to say that I bought another brand for 1/2 the price from QVC.  I liked it, but it wasn't real good quality, the pot was non-sick, and we all know non-stick wears out.  Due to other issues, I returned the cheap one to QVC and bought this one.I LOVE THIS INSTANT POT!!  I didn't want to spend the money, but after reading the reviews I decided to buy it and I am so glad I did,  I want to say the quality of the Instant Pot is superb.  I really like the stainless steal pot.  It is good quality, plus it has a heavy plat on the bottom.  I can really tell the difference from the cheap one.  I would buy this again in a NY minute!  I've made pot roast in it in about an hour.  I made tomato sauce w/no meat in 5 min.  The rice comes out perfect.  The other night I decided to put an oven roast in it.  It was 4 1/2 lbs and may still have been a little frozen in the middle.  I put it in for 30 min.  the inside was only 40 deg., so I put it in for another 30 min and it read 150 deg.  I let it rest and put the duo pot on sauté and made my gravy.  When I sliced my roast it was perfectly pink all the way thru and is delicious!!  I haven't tried to yogurt yet, or slow cook or steam, but everything I cook comes out great.  I am getting ready to try my cheesecake in it.I also highly recommend the following book:Hip Pressure Cooking: Fast, Fresh, and Flavorful Hardcover  - September 2, 2014 by Laura D.A. Pazzaglia  (Author)She explains everything, plus gives the time for stovetop and electronic.  She also has done a video on the Instant Pot.  I have a stove top pressure cooker, buy never mastered it.  I have an electric stove and with the stovetop cooker, you have to get 2 burners going.  Once your pot comes to pressure, you have to have a 2nd burner at low heat and transfer it over.  The only problem is you have to babysit it to make sure it stays at pressure.  Just too much trouble for me.  That is why I use the Instant Pot all the time.  NO BABYSITTING!!!!ALSO:  I just wanted to mention that it is normal for steam to escape when you are bringing it up to pressure.  My cheap one didn't mention it in the manual and I thought it was broken and sent it back to QVC, but I am so glad I did because this is much nicer.  I can feel the difference, even the way the lid locks in.  You will not be disappointed if you buy this.  It is well worth every penny (although I wish it was cheaper)."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I can honestly say that I'm now glad that my crock pot insert cracked, sparking me to go online and find this gem. I'm still learning all of the things I can do with it, but it's worth it's weight in gold so far. The pressure cooker takes minutes to cook what used to take me hours. You can even pressure cook frozen meat straight from the freezer when in a pinch for time. You can brown/sautee your food, then switch the cooker to adjustable pressure cooking or slow cook just like in the crock pot. I love that you can also make the gravy right in the same insert, instead of having to risk burns or dropping your food to transport liquids to the stovetop like I always had to do with the crock pots I had. The insert is metal, so this one isn't going to break or crack on me like my 4 crock pots in years past. Really happy I got this, it's made my life so much easier."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Asked my wife if the mini was still useful for her. She said that she still uses it daily for oatmeal and wouldn't part with it. She said the rice button works fantastically and is so much easier than trying to make it on the stove top. The porridge button works good with steel cut oats, but any other type with either ""food burn"" error or come out slimy. She also uses it for soups and baking potatoes although primarily the big one gets that task if making more than 2. Picked up from the Amazon Warehouse with a great discount because of a dent. Dent popped right out. Simple matter of three screws in the bottom and pushing out on the ring."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I really like it. Cooks in no time.I live alone and thought I'd only need the 3 quart. It's very good for what it is but I'm going to buy the 6 quart because all the online recipes are for the 6 or 8 quart Instant Pot. Which means you have to 1/2 the recipe. Somewhat of a pain, especially if you forget to 1/2 one of your ingredients.I am not a cook, but I'm learning. Thanks to Instant Pot prepping and cooking surprisingly fast and your results are perfect."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"We ordered this from the warehouse to give as a gift to my monther-in-law. She lives alone and we wanted to get her something that would make cooking for one a lot more simple while not taking up a lot of counter space.This fit the bill and she likes it.I poked around it and noticed that it has a stainless pressure pot unlike our aluminum one and I like that better. You can also sauté in it which is great because you don't have to prep your onions, garlic, and peppers in a separate pan making clean up less work.Gift win."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Bought this as a present for my better half.  She opened it on Christmas and used it that day. Had a few hiccups with the process, getting the burn message, but we did some digging and hopefully figured it out. It's not as instant as it claims or everyone else claims. Yes it does take a shorter time, and you can do stuff in between. But, the issue is, if your recipe is too watery or doesn't have enough water, it won't turn out as good. The device is very smart and keeps tabs on the whole process. Quality of the device is very good. It's very easy to make a meal that is for a large army, while doing their laundry. If you do purchase one, ease in to it very slowly with easier meals. Learn the process and take your time with it, there's a learning curve.Update 8 months later- instant is working wonderfully!  My family enjoys dinners made with it almost all of the time. Only time we don't is when the recipe doesn't work out how it should. We've cooked chicken- from frozen and it was great!  Made a whole ham for Easter thoroughly cooked and not dry. It also makes cleaning up very simple!  Fewer pots and pans and utensils. It works best for families on the go, or parents working different shifts."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Best purchase ever.  0 regrets.  We use this almost every day and it even got my husband to cook!!! We’ve been together for 6 years and he has never cooked for me until now.  Magic!  If I could marry my instant pot, I would.  It has proven more useful than my husband has ever been.  I wish I had this back when I lived in a small apartment. So fast! So delish!  Tastes like the food has been cooking in a crock pot all day!  It even cooks FROZEN chicken breasts in record time!  I’m talking rock solid to tender in 20 mins or less.  Fricking amazing!  The meat just falls apart, so tender and yum.  I’m in love!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've been using this pressure cooker for about a month now, and I love it.  It is nicely made and high quality.  The interior pot is good, heavy stainless steel.  The saute option works better than I expected.It did take a couple of tries for me to learn how to use the buttons correctly (specifically, the adjust one), but now that I am doing it right, I don't understand why I had a problem to begin with.  It is simple.  Apparently, I don't understand simple.I've cooked ribs in beer for for my husband, lemon garlic chicken, various soups, brown rice, and various beans.  Do note that the ""rice"" setting is for white rice, not brown, but my rice cooked beautifully with a manual setting.  As a vegetarian, I cook lots of beans and grains, and this pot makes it so easy.  I don't have to plan hours in advance.I cooked split pea soup (I know some of you are saying ""ewwwww!), and split peas are notorious for foaming.  I added a bit of oil to the pot and used two cups of split peas plus 1/4 cup of hulled barley, and the pot handled it beautifully.  The lid opens and locks easily, and the release value is easy to use if you are using a quick release.I used to make my own yogurt but haven't done that for awhile.  However, this pot has a yogurt setting, so I'm going to try making my own again.The high setting seems to have a lower psi than some stove-top pressure cookers, but that is not a problem for me.  I had a stove-top cooker that I used a few times, and got rid of.  It didn't set on my glass-top stove as evenly as it should so didn't work well, and it was hard to get the right temperature for the pot.  This electric one works much, much better for me.Cleaning the little seal ring and getting the lid dry is a bit of a bother, but I think that is the nature of pressure cookers.  The recipe booklet could be more helpful than it is, but I've been checking out library pressure cooker cookbooks while deciding which I want to buy.  There is a chart of times for various meats, grains and beans, and vegetables, which is handy,The pot comes with a little rack and a couple of utensils and a measuring cup made of plastic.  Because you are probably smarter than I am, you probably will not turn the pot to ""saute"" before taking out the utensils.  Bye-bye, little plastic measuring cup.  Fortunately, I noticed before I caused any real damage.I wanted a pressure cooker, but now that I have one, I am using it more than I expected to.  And for me, electric is the way to go."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"It fixed my love life!I used to spend hours and hours pouring over cookbooks and planning out a weekly menu that might entice my family to eat and keep my wife interested in me but my oh my.. how things changed!I now give dinners zero thought. Literally. I don’t think about it at all. I’ve left that task to my Instapot. After a simple one time setup, the Instapot takes control. Luring innocent animals in from the wild with the promise of fresh baked biscuits, the Instapot traps and pressure cooks the beasts .. leaving me time to focus on my partner for hours and hours of focused, directed love-making. After which, a delicious smelling and tasting meal awaits.Thanks Instapot!"
2.0 out of 5 stars,"I really loved this product. Easy to use, lots of recipes around that I could try, easy to understand how it works. Real time saver. My favorites where making pulled pork, doing beans really quickly and then I branched out and started to experiment on my own with some Thai dishes.  So why the 2 star review. Well that is simple. One Sunday I decided to make beans and rice. Things were going pretty well but all of a sudden I smelled this acrid electrical smell and my Instant Pot died. I was disappointed since it was only 4 months old but given that the company offers a year warrantee I figured I’d contact them and they’d send me a new one and I’d be off to the races again. Au contraire.After providing a lot of documentation that included pictures and serial numbers (logical I guess) I was told I would get a replacement. What I wasn’t told was they were only sending the base. Not the entire unit. I guess they think they can save some bucks by only replacing the base and having you keep the lid and the insert. Ok. I can see that too.HOWEVER, they ran out of bases. I’ve been emailing the customer service department and they respond pretty quickly with “the part you need is not available.” Then they go on to tell me they don’t know when it will be available.So the deal is you can get a warrantee replacement. The fine print is that it’s only the part that is broken and they don’t have those in stock, and they don’t know when they are going to get them in stock again.I find it hard to believe that the Instant Pot people know so little about their business that they don’t know when the next shipment of bases will be arriving. I am pretty sure somewhere over in corporate planning someone has a spreadsheet that says we’re going to get 5,000 bases on August 18th so we’ll be able to tell these customers that.Or maybe not. Maybe their corporate planning department is on vacation in August and there’s no one in that department. Maybe they really have no idea what is going to show up next. I can imagine people at the warehouse standing on the loading dock waiting on the truck to back up to see if there is anything in it.In any case a great appliance that lacks warrantee service or customer service. There are some other options on the market that, if I could get a refund, I would probably try.Not impressed."
1.0 out of 5 stars,"I found this cooker not to be user friendly at all. Actually, it's a bit scary. There's nothing on the LCD screen to say it's warming-up which takes ten minutes. And the other ""prompts"" are displayed in something resembling secret launch code. You need to be CIA to figure out which mode the machine is in AND TO UNDERSTAND WHEN IT'S DONE COOKING which I believe makes the designers negligent. And you'll need the eyes of a hawk to determine in which position the ""safety-float"" is in.  Also, the steam release valve is a loose-fitting joke and hard to trust. A pressure cooker is potentially dangerous, and it needs to be easy to understand to use safely. Big mistake in purchasing this. It feels like I invited a mechanical monster, a dangerous monster, into my kitchen."
3.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought this electric pressure cooker after doing research and looking at product recommendations. My first unit had a problem; it was replaced promptly in a very smooth transaction. My current unit beeps when its suppose to, goes through all its functions seamlessly. However, I have found that when I allow the unit to set the time for me for ""meat"" or ""poultry"" I don't get the tender fall-off-the-bone results that pressure cookers are famous for. I have adjusted the timer, always adding more minutes and results have been fine, but when you are feeding a hungry family its tough to say ""l've set it for 15 more minutes"" (on top of 35+ minutes on auto set). I keep tweaking the time and it's approaching stove top cooking. So what are the advantages? well, its self monitoring. You can set it and walk the dog. After cooking time is done, the unit goes into ""warm"" mode. It's sort of a cross between a fast crock pot and self monitoring stove top pressure cooker.  My mother had one of those old fashioned stove top pressure cookers that you prayed would never blow it's little free standing jiggling steam regulator, but she cooked up countless lip smacking fall-off-the-bone eveything meals with it. I am up to 40 minutes for a beef stew and about the same for chicken & rice. I have made both on stove top, with same flavors as a result and slightly better tenderness for the chicken. Not having to keep a close eye is the biggest advantage of this electric pressure cooker, I am still working on figuring out the the perfect cook times - its not the in the autosets! The unit is well made, has a good design, big easy to read buttons/readout, and it has various checks & balances so it's safer (it feels safer) than the stove top pressure cookers. The components are stainless steel, easy to clean & the lift-out inner pot goes from kitchen to dinner table to refrigerator. It's kind of a trade-off. Wish I could love it more."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I am used to cooking with pressure cooker and never had an electric pressure cooker and never thought of getting one as I didn't care to understand the difference between both versions. Then my cousin told me he bought one of these and really likes it. So I was willing to give it a try and ordered a 3 quart version. Got delivered this afternoon and made dinner - mint rice pilaf - same recipe o use in the pressure cooker. In fact the rice cooked in the instapot turned out much better than the regular one I make using my pressure cooker on the stove. The 3 quart size is big enough for us and I am planning on trying various recipes soon.The main thing I like about it is, I can set the setting and walk away and don't have to check on it multiple times or don't have to turn the stove off. Perfect to set it up and go for a shower and come and my food is ready. Happy so far and I am sure I will use it a lot.I also paid $4 extra and got the warranty not sure it is helpful but thought I will get it anyways.Now I need to search for more vegetarian recipes online and start cooking."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love my instant pot MINi! Great for our RV and works just as well as our 6Qt IP. When I originally bought our first instant pot a couple of years ago, the smallest available was the 5Qt but the actually size/weight was so negligible that I ended up buying the 6. I was so excited when the 3 quart came out and feel it’s the ideal size for an RV or just a couple or solo. That said, I do actually like having 2 IPs as sometimes I will cook rice in the smaller one and a meal in the bigger one. The 6Qt is probably better for families or potlucks or if you like to entertain, but if you are a solo, couple, and/or live in a small place - condo, tiny home or RV - then the 3 quart is a fantastic size and works well. Love it!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I am a farily experienced IP user and got the mini for side dishes and daily cooking for a household of 2.  It is perfect for us, and takes up less counter space than my 6 quart.  Perfect to make 1/2 gallon of yogurt, which I do weekly.  Using the IP does require a bit of learning but so worth it in the end."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Man this thing can make pretty much everything. However, the quality is mainly up to you so YMMV.Safety features are pretty straightforward. You'd have to be a bodybuilder to even think about opening this thing under pressure anyways, it's sealed tight.Very easy to clean compared to my old aroma rice cooker. Much harder to spill things, and the water doesn't build up in any tiny hard to reach places. Pot is stainless steel and plastic so it's easy to clean outside. The internal pot is also stainless and after a good soak will shed anything stuck to it."
2.0 out of 5 stars,"We enjoyed using it for steaming sweet potatoes and cooking rice daily.  We purchased it on Nov 25th, 2017 and started using it only in December. It stopped working by October 26th, 2018 in about 10 months of use. The Product Support section says that it is ""ineligible for Product Support"".  Needless to say, we are disappointed that it stopped working in 10 months after proving very useful."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"How did I live without this? I don't know. Seriously? 18 eggs at once?  And they peel like a dream even days later??? Whhhaaaattttt? And steel cut oats? OMG - amazingly creamy and NO STIRRING OR WATCHING!! I do sweet potatoes - and they never lose their color, stay juicy and are so good. And 22 minutes done! I cook a lot of fancy things  - and I have always been afraid of pressure cookers - this Insta Pot has taken away my fear.  I made a small brisket in 33 minutes under pressure - it was perfect. It also helps me make a batch of whatever I choose so that I can portion it for work lunches. Such a great product - and seriously? Unless you're feeding 5 people? The 3qt is all you need. Maybe you can't do giant cuts of meat? But do we really need to eat that much anyway? It's just perfect. Get it. You'll love it."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"I really like this device.  It makes quite a few things just perfectly.  It has very high quality construction.  The cord has the same connectors as a standard computer cord, but is really heavy duty.  It has numerous safety features, like redundant pressure and temperature sensors, and a elegantly simple pressure activated interlock to prevent removing the lid when there there is pressure inside.  But the controls are difficult to use.  That kept it from getting 5 stars.As to the controls, there is this very confusing ""adjust"" button.  It does different things for each of the about 7 basic selections.  For soups, saute, and slow cook it controls the temperature.  For porridge you use it to tell the pot that it is multi-grain porridge, rather than rice.  For poultry it changes the cooking time.  (Redundant with the +and - buttons.)  For rice it has no effect.  For multigrain, you can choose between 3 choices:40 minutes, 20 minutes and 45 minutes of warm soaking followed by 60 minutes of pressure.  For steam and manual, the instruction manual makes no mention of this button. For yogurt you can choose an option to first bring the milk to a boil.  But for all of this, you only see ""less"", ""normal"", or ""more"" on the panel.  You have to have the manual at hand to know what ""less"", ""normal"", and ""more"" mean in the selected mode.There is a delay function that allows you to delay the start for some amount of time.  (The button is labeled ""timer"".) When you naively use it, it seems that you can only set the delay to a multiple of an hour.  But, if you read the manual, you will discover that after you have set the hours, you can push ""timer"" again, and then the + and - buttons will control the minutes.After most of the functions have run to completion, the unit is in a keep-warm state that does what you would expect.  But an extra piece of paper that comes in the box says that you can turn the keep-warm feature off by double-pressing the selection button (""saute"", etc.)  when you first start.And, finally, this additional piece of paper tells you that you can silence the beeps by pressing and holding the ""-"" button for 3 seconds.So you had better keep the manual and the addendum handy in your kitchen.  You are going to need it."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"Purchased this last year with a giftcard I got for Christmas. It's a dinnertime game changer. So versatile, easy, and QUICK! Many of my families new favorite dinner recipes come from this Instant Pot. For ideas just get on Pinterest - there are so many fantastic blogs out there with amazing recipes. However, I did dock a star because I just can't stand out smelly the rubber/silicone (?) gasket gets after cooking savory dishes. It is virtually impossible to get the smell out. I recommend doing what other reviewers have mentioned and definitely buy another one if you plan to use the pot for sweet dishes too. I have tried so many ways to remove the smell and just can't seem to get rid of it. It's frustrating, but overall the ease and deliciousness of the dishes I make far outweigh the smelly gasket ring."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I wish I could give this more than 5 stars. It makes me really stop to think ""hmm... all of those other things I have given five star ratings to weren't nearly as life-alteringly amazing as this. Did they even DESERVE five stars, in comparison? None of those other items have taught me the meaning of life, why should they get as many stars as my Instant Pot??""I absolutely despise spending a lot of time in the kitchen after work. I am tired, just want to pour a glass of wine, and binge watch Supernatural. I mean *cough* some other, more respectable, grown up television program. Anywho, my boyfriend can't cook to save his life, so that isn't much help either. I'd feel better eating something created out of real, edible foods rather than microwaved in a pouch with fake cheese, so I cook even when I stay over at his house.This all put me in a difficult spot, thinking about our future. Well, crap. What's going to happen one day when I have kids? If my boyfriend doesn't sharpen his cooking game, I will be the one stuck cooking for our future children. It kills my soul having to cook for JUST ME ALONE after a long day's work, how am I going to pull that off? Turn into a parent who picks up Taco Bell on a regular basis? (Don't get me wrong, I love Taco Bell). Be a constantly cranky and frazzled mom who gets no rest? (I anticipate that anyway, who am I kidding?) Just when I was pondering the option of breaking up and finding a man who can cook (not really), INSTANT POT HAPPENED!Dinner is done and ready to eat every time in less than an hour. Sometimes WAY less than an hour. I can't believe I survived 30 years without one! It would have been AMAZING back when I was in college! I am constantly learning new things I can whip up (sometimes trial and error, sometimes recipe books). I can throw frozen chicken breasts in it, seasoning, just hit poultry setting, adjust the time up a bit, and boom. Super tender amazing chicken. Something about handling raw chicken makes me too disgusted to eat it once it's cooked, so being able to throw it in frozen is such a relief.My favorite is to cube up some steak, dust it in taco seasoning, throw it into the pot with black beans and salsa. hit ""meat/stew"", and serve it on top of some wild rice. If I am feeling fancy, put chopped lettuce and tomato on top. If I feel EXTRA fancy, brown some onions with the ""saute"" function before everything goes in. It is so good every time! When I his an Instant Pot creativity roadblock, I just default to that! Also love making oatmeal in it. pro tip: grease the pot with butter before you put all the oatmeal stuff in.I have bought one for myself, one for my boyfriend's place, one for my mom and dad, and one for my brother. That man of mine is GOING to learn how to cook; even if it is just with the Instant Pot. I have ranted and raved about it to so many people that I've coerced two coworkers, my landlord's wife, my auntie, two separate cousins, and a handful of facebook friends to buy one. They all love it too! Aaahh! It's like we are starting an Instant Pot cult! WE WILL TURN YOU *HISSSSSS*Man, these guys get a lot of free advertising LOL. But hey, you can't argue with the kind of ratings this thing gets. It's definitely for a reason!! Thank you, Instant Pot, for sparing my future kids a childhood filled with fast food and microwaved pouch meals!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Never knew an appliance could have such a cult following! I’ve had this for about 4 months. I use it at least 3x a week. It’s been such a great addition to my kitchen. I got rid of my slow cooker and rice cooker. I even bought an duo80 as a secondary for when I need a larger capacity or cooking two things at once.But the 6 quart is what I use most often. We are a family of 4 (2 kids under 10) and so far I have felt the 6 quart has been perfect for us. It also comes to pressure a bit faster than the 8 quart.I recommend joining some recipe groups on social media. So many ideas.What I like most about this product:1) one pot cooking. Most recipes everything is cooked in one pot. From sautéing to browning, then pressure cooking. You don’t even have to pressure cook if you don’t want to.2) pretty much set it and forget it! Once you start it you can walk away and do stuff. And it’s a much shorter time than a slow cooker. So I don’t have to load it up in the morning before work.3) so many recipes are out there! So many! I’ve tried Indian Butter Chicken, spaghetti and meat sauce (with noodles), rice is so quick!, honey garlic chicken, chicken adobo, chicken pho ga, chicken soup, ribs, even cheesecake and banana bread.4) Cooking from frozen! When I’m in a pinch and not sure what to make I can always take out some frozen chicken to make something. In fact I keep a whole, pre-seasoned chicken in my freezer all the time (3-4 lb). I’ll pull that out. It takes about an hour and a half because I like to broil it after for 5–10 minutes.Seems like a long time but it’s from frozen! Frozen!5) one pot cooking = One pot to cleaning"
5.0 out of 5 stars,I love my Instant Pot! I understand the hype why everyone raves about it because it’s a timesaver and excellent tool in the kitchen.  I’ve used it to make perfect butternut squash in 8 minutes and have also used it to make meatloaf and one pot pasta. I want to buy the accessories from Amazon so that I can make a lot more yummy stuff. I’m a believer!
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is difficult to get used to, specially if you have a long tradition with regular kitchenware, but boy what a different does it make when you learn how to use it. There are plenty of books with food of different types out there and lots of stuff in the internet and facebook, so feel safe to buy and learn.Bad aspect about this specific product is the fact that most accessories are out of stock and I've been waiting months and months for them to come back. So basically, if you are ok with just having the product and not accessories, this is good, as it is not as pricey as the other pots and does the job. For a family of 2, like me, it is perfect; all other pots were too big for me.Also, this is super easy to clean, guys, quite an improvement for me. I can use the same pot to do the entire dish and then clean only 1 pot (which is super easy to clean as I said). I don't use dishwasher, so before this product, it was hell to clean everything. Now life is so easy it's boring (lol)"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm not new to electric pressure cookers, but this is my first Instant Pot. When I did get my first pressure cooker about three years ago, IP was way out of our price range so I went with a different model. It was fine, and it worked, but developed a few quirks, and because of it I didn't ever really deep dive into pressure cooking, but rather used it for the basic things. It finally got to the point where it had more issues than benefits and my husband told me to order a new one, a better one, and a bigger one. I ended up getting the 8qt Duo Nova, and have zero regrets. I did have a laugh because they describe it as a ""beginners"" model because of the auto sealing lid and push button release. Who wouldn't want those features?!? Honestly, those were the two main selling points because I felt like I could start teaching my 12 year old how to use it and not worry about whether she would remember all the things. After using the IP multiple times I feel like they should just make those two things standard on all models going forward. I love not having to worry about whether it's sealed/venting, and the push button release is amazing.After using my old pressure cooker, the IP feels like upgrading from a compact car to a luxury SUV. I've literally used it at least once a day since I got it. Everything has turned out amazing. Yogurt, rice, chicken curry, dump cake... all good, and things that I hadn't even bothered to try with my old pressure cooker. I also love the 8 qt size. You can fit cheese cake and other baking pans up to 9"" in diameter inside. Photos are of the box before opening, homemade yogurt with fresh dragon fruit from our yard (yum!) and a dump cake I made in the time it took to make a pot of coffee. Comes with basic instructions in the box, but definitely go to the website for more in-depth info and cook times, and also download the app. You can set your device in the app, then it auto adjusts the recipes to your specific cooker :)"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my first Instant Pot purchase. Five stars all the way! So far I’ve made the best slab of tender, fall off the bone, Baby Back Ribs of my life and some delicious peel and eat shrimp! I can easily tell that this device will be a spectacular addition to my kitchen. Simple setup and extremely easy to use! BUY ONE NOW! The 8 quart pot easily handles a slab of ribs, a large chicken and just about anything you can throw at it! This pot is simply AWESOME! YouTube is PACKED with videos detailing Instant Pot recipes, accessories and care!"
4.0 out of 5 stars,"It's a little more complicated system to program than my old instapot.  Make sure you real the instructions.  Works very well, except for dried lentils, can't seem to cook them all the way through on max time limit, maybe there's a setting I'm missing."
3.0 out of 5 stars,"After two years of use, it now can no longer trap the steam and cook without burning.Yes: I've put in new sealing rings (made by Instant Pot), a new valve and release knob. I called Customer Service, reported the problem, was told I'd be contacted, and no one ever did.I have a 6 qt model that continues to work, but it's not been used as much. It's a great tool, but if it's going to fail every 2.5 years, it's way too expensive."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"I've used the Air Fryer lid a couple of times now. We've mainly cooked chicken legs and some sweet potato fries and it seems to get the job done. Haven't tried any of the other settings other than Air Fry but it gets the chicken legs super crispy.So far, the only down-side is the portion sizes in comparison to the actual Instant Pot. Our IP is 6QT and that's what this lid fits bit you can't cook nearly the same volume of food. If you want to air fry larger batches of food you might opt for a machine that does only that. We went with the lid to try and save some space since our kitchen doesn't have that much counter space to work with."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I own 2 other 6 qt Instant Pots and absolutely love them. One issue is though when I make beans or rice, I don't always want a big batch. My wife and I don't have the same tastes, so I can make a smaller recipe/batch that is just for me and this 3 qt works great for that."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love it so far. I was disappointed though that they don't offer either a steamer basket, glass lid, nor silicon lid for the pot. I think for the money, it should have at least come with the silicon lid and the other two items could be optional, but at least available. If I could take off half a star for these annoyances, I would.I know I'm going to use this unit all the time for steaming since I tried it on green beans the other day and it was fantastic. The unit heats up to cooking temp in about 4 minutes and the beans are done in another 2 minutes or so. With this steamer basket I just ordered, I'm hoping this will work out very nicely.So, which 3rd party steamer basket? I did a fair amount of research and my decision came down to these two because I wanted a steaming container, not just a shallow steaming platform. I want to be able to pull the whole thing out easily and not have to worry about dumping some of the contents back into the steam water, if you know what I mean. So again down to these two:1. https://www.amazon.com/dp/B019D7MSZA/ref=psdc_289761_t2_B007SPKR8U - This one works according to some reviewers of the 8qt model. It fits if you remove the handles. For some folks that might be a bit of a challenge to remove those with a hacksaw or other tool.2. https://www.amazon.com/Fagor-998338900-Pasta-Basket/dp/images/B0000717BM - I chose this one.I chose the Fagor because it has a handle that swings out of the way and I did ideally want a handle. One thing I don't know about this""pasta basket"" is whether it has holes in the bottom. After all it is a pasta basket, not a steamer basket specifically. If it doesn't have holes in the bottom, I'm going to test steaming and see how it works since there are plenty of holes on the sides. Seems to me it should work quite well whether there are holes in the bottom or not. But, if I'm wrong and think it's not performing quite right, I'll drill holes in the bottom if they are indeed not already there. I can't tell from the picture. It also does not have a platform to raise above the water, so I'll just put the Instant Pot trivet beneath it.So far I made chicken soup (came out great and fast), boneless country style ribs (came out fall off the bone tender and tasty in an hour), and the green beans I steamed. The steaming feature really surprised me how fast it is. After all pressure cookers always take awhile to heat up. But I'd forgotten that it's only heating up about a cup and a half of water, not six quarts of liquid and solids before it's up to temp. So, it's very fast steaming. I'll update this review in regard to the choice of steamer basket. Option #2 is a bit more costly though but still reasonable, I think. It was $18 including shipping from Fagor.All for now..."
1.0 out of 5 stars,"This is a nice cooker when it works. This is my second  purchase of the same cooker. Both of them stopped working in less than 1 year. I have 4 years standard warranty from SquareTrade. I started my communication from Amazon, they told me that I need to contact the SquareTrade. I am seating on the phone with SquareTrade  more than one hour and nothing good happened. They say that Amazon must resolve the issue. However, Amazon passing me to SquareTrade. This is a nightmare. I never will buy a cooker from this manufacturer. The SquaeTrade standard protection plan is a bad joke"

   First let me say I really like this thing but it is not ""instant"" it cooks pasta in 1 minute BUT it sometimes takes 20 minutes or more to heat up. Overall I like it so much easier than cooking pasta on a stove. You can put all types of foods in it and just let it go without checking it like you normally would if you were cooking on a stove. It is very versatile as I cook pasta in it and also have made yogurt - would recommend!"
4.0 out of 5 stars,"I absolutely love my instapot!  The only reason I gave this 4 stars is because of the odors that the silicone sealer absorbs.  I've tried to soak it in lemon juice and that helps, but if you want to make things that absorb flavors like dessert, rice, yogurt, you will need to purchase an extra ring for those.  That said, I do love it!  I've made the best pinto beans and the best black beans I have ever had.  I've made soups, chili, whole chickens, bone broth(in  2 hours, not 12-18 hours), whole squashes, pulled pork and some other dishes and have loved the way all of the meals have turned out!  It's only my husband and myself and I almost went with the smaller size but am really glad I didn't.  I freeze leftovers in containers and they make great work lunches!  Healthier and cheaper than eating out!"
4.0 out of 5 stars,"Pros: Picked this item up from the Treasure Truck. Our family loves the versatility and ease of use. We’ve made one pot lemon chicken and (can’t remember which my husband made) Indian chicken dish, chili, used it as a rice cooker, and steamed vegetables.Con: 1) Size: our family likes leftovers, and this is enough for 1-1.5 meals for us, unless you’re using it as a rice/grain cooker - then it makes enough for leftovers! 2) Burn warning: we find it difficult to determine the ratio of fluid to solid food item, even when using the bean/chili button. My husband tried making chili, followed the instructions of an instapot chili recipe, however we kept getting burn warnings. After adding more and more liquid (1/4c at a time) without improvement, we finally pulled some rice and beans out and it finished cooking. 3) Saves dishes, not time: Don’t expect this to cook your food faster, as it’s a pressure cooker. You can set a timer to start cooking while you’re at busy doing other things, but make sure you’ve got you’re recipe down - referring back to #2."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"When people explained what it did, it didn't seem that great. Honestly, it didn't seem to save a lot of time because people were always talking about how fast pasta is now..... isn't pasta already really fast the make?I finally bought one because I really wanted to make yogurt and and try it out and Amazon had it on a good sale, so I bought it and I LOVE IT.PRO:Perfect shell melt off hard boiled eggs and fast, perfect every time so far.Makes better rice than my rice cooker (I cook it in a bowl in the pot with 1 to 1 ratio) perfect every timeI was able to make shredded pork in 45 mins, rather than 8 hours and didn't change the flavor at allThe yogurt took a while to get down, but it is good, different, but good. Kids liked itBaked potato in 15 mins!I love that I don't have to turn my oven hot and make my house boiling. It is perfect for summer cooking when you need to keep the house coolI can saute in the pan and cook in the pan, less dirty dishes.ConIf you burn something bad in the pan it is hard to get clean, but it is do able.You need to get comfortable with this machine and it is a little intimidating, but it is worth itThere is a learning curve with some items, like dairy items, learning how long to cook things, how much liquid needs to be in the pan, NOT accidentally leaving valves open ha ha.But, worth the money and storage. I use it multiple times a week."

5.0 out of 5 stars,"Everyone on social media was posting pictures of their ""success stories"" with these cooking pots, so I had to try it. I read the instructions THOROUGHLY and decided I was going to put it to use the next day, and chickened out!  I was afraid I'd blow it up and me with it.  My son, who cooks all the time, said he'd LOVE to try it, so I gave it to him.  So this review is really from him.  He uses it a lot - cooks a lot on weekends and has uses it for handy meals during the week.  He loves it, and said he didn't have any cookware that he's using as much."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"My mother-in-law was raving about this Instant Pot for months, so we finally gave in and bought one for ourselves. We’re a working couple, and this appliance saves us tons of time. There’s a learning curve, especially when it comes to figuring out cooking times (don’t ignore the manual!), but once we got that out of the way, oh my… it’s such a time - and space - saver!I’d say it takes around 45 min to cook something that would normally take 1.5-2 hours. Also, the clean-up is super easy, as there’s just one pot to clean in the end.After a few weeks of using the Pot, we bought a couple of add-ons to get the most out of it. My husband and I are both vegetarians, so we eat a lot of veggies (and I mean, A LOT). We bought a 

  
Steamer Basket









  
  
    
  , and use it to steam all kinds of veggies, make poached eggs, etc. It fits just fine in the 6-qt Pot and lets you easily lift whatever it is you’re cooking out of the pot. If you decide to buy a steamer basket, make sure it’s sturdy, well-built and deep enough. We also invested in a

If I were going to give the Instant Pot as a gift (and I suspect that some of my family members may have Instant Pots in their future ;~) ) I would absolutely include this Steamer Basket and lid with the gift.https://www.amazon.com/gp/aws/cart/add.html?ASIN.1=B008FUJ2LK&Quantity.1=1&ASIN.2=B07C51JWFF&Quantity.2=1"

4.0 out of 5 stars,"There are so many reviews for the Instant Pot, I didn't know anything about pressure cooking so I'm reviewing from that stand point.  I did think that the directions were a little overwhelming and confusing, when really they could have been much more simple.  This is a very easy product to use.Mine came with the lid seal in place and the only thing I had to assemble was the little water condensation catcher...I don't even remember where that went?  After that, it was more important to read the recipes and the difference between quick release and slow release. My advice is to find a good youtube tutorial if you are having trouble.  I've seen on some FB pages people really screwing up there food... I'm not really sure how that happens. Just follow the directions.  Whole chicken is so easy, 3 -4 pound chicken, season, add 1 cup water or broth, then set for 25 min on manual, and walk away. You let it slow release, it's amazingly easy.  Try the poached eggs!I still have a lot to experiment with, but so far, this thing is awesome. Loving it."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"Ive been using this for a little while now and it works great for everything I've done with it.my only two complaints are1: rice sticks/burns to the bottom no matter what i do, this is minor and just means i have to scrub harder when i clean it.2: my unit arrived with a golfball sized dent in the side of it, it hasnt affected its performance at all. The box was undamaged which means this was damaged prior to packaging. Quality control should have caught this."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"LOVE THIS!  I've been cooking for years and am pretty good at it, but have been getting bored, too busy etc etc - you know all the excuses one uses to ""run out of time"" so we must simply go out and get something from Taco Bell (Or fill in your favorite fast food restaurant).  Anyway, I had never even seen a pressure cooker in real life.  A few of my favorite bloggers (Paleo Parents, Nom Nom Paleo to name two right off the bat) had mentioned this wonderful device, but I didn't really take much notice of it b/c a) the cost and b) no frame of reference.  Then my dear mother asked me if I wanted one.  She had been reading about them and offered me one for Christmas.  I said SURE! (who wouldn't?)  It came.  Now what?  I started googling ""how to cook with the Instant Pot"" and found many websites and recipes to be very helpful.  I printed off a recipe, (read the manuals first of course) and started with Chicken and Dumplings.  AMAZING and FAST and DELICIOUS!  I was intrigued.  I bought Bob Warden's two cookbooks:  Great Food Fast and Slow Food Fast, and also Hip Pressure Cooking (I love real books)  I devoured those for techniques, tips etc and then I joined Instant Pot Community on Facebook.  I have been LOVING using this device.  I love to peruse the cookbooks, print off recipes from the Community, and then go to town.  It is so easy, the instructions are clear, there is plenty of help out there and everything I have made so far has turned out to be absolutely delicious!  I can even cook meat from frozen (a huge seller for me - read the first sentence!  I'm not always great at planning ahead)  Now I can pull out a recipe, put it on the table in a short time and know I'm feeding my family delicious, tasty and healthy meals.  This Instant Pot is worth its weight in gold.  I've made a roast (ooh-la-la!), Porcupine Meatballs (they've never turned out before, tonight they are outstanding!), Chicken and Dumplings (none better since my Gluten free-for-all days), Chicken and Wild Rice Soup, Beef Stew, hard boiled eggs (SO easy to peel), and my whole chicken is cooking right now as I type.  (I did the porcupine meatballs before I left for work so I would have something to heat up quick for dinner before my family heads out to watch basketball games).  The chicken we will eat, then I will make a few batches of bone broth tomorrow.  I can't believe this device is making cooking fun again!.I've not tried to do more with it than pressure cooking, although someone on the Instant Pot Community (Facebook) posted something about coconut yogurt in the IP.  Guess what I'm going to make this weekend (after making bone broth - and I'll have time b/c it won't take 24 hours like it would in a slow cooker!)?  You won't regret your purchase.  As Tony the Tiger used to say ""It's Grrrrrrrreat!"""
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have been using this instant pot every week for several months now and it is a game changer for my meal preps. It is easy to use, but I did find the instructions a little unclear. I ended up watching a couple videos on Youtube which explained the features of the instant pot a lot better than the instructions. After getting it set up and getting familiar with it, I never looked back at conventional cooking for my meal preps. It saves so much time in preparing my meals and it easy to find recipes online. Literally thousands of recipes are available to you and can easily be made using the features on this product. Now I did notice that the rubber ring that goes in the lid absorbs the smells of strong spices. It is almost impossible to get rid of the smell, but thankfully doesn't affect the taste of the dishes. All in all, I'd say this is an awesome product and highly recommend it to people that need a fast and easy way to cook for a family or for busy people that don't have an hour to spend on cooking something."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Although I’ve only had my IP for a few days, I am beyond pleased with its performance. It’s larger than it looks, so it will take up some counter space. Also, keep in mind these new appliances have shorter cords. Ideally, you should use it away from your cabinets due to the amount of steam they produce.Most of the functions you’ll use WON’T be in the quick program buttons. The majority of users find it more practical to use the Pressure Cook (also referred to as manual) feature and set the time. Recipes generally don’t include the time it takes for the IP to get hot or build up pressure, and many don’t tell you how long it takes for full depressurization (when you can actually open the lid). It will depend on the quantity of food and liquid, as well as temperature, time, and pressure settings. You’ll get used to it. I cooked a 3-lb pork loin roast from start to finish in an hour and a half. It took about 10 minutes to get up to pressure, an hour to cook, and 20 minutes to release the pressure.Speaking of pressure, there’s a knob on top of the lid that you turn to either vent or seal. This allows you to do what’s called a Quick Pressure Release. It’s fast, a bit loud, and steamy —  so be careful. This is a normal and frequently used feature, as some foods need to get out of the heat quickly. Other recipes, such as whole cuts of meat, generally allow time for what’s called a Natural Pressure Release (where the pot slowly releases pressure on it’s own). This is like the pressure cookers of the older generation. You just wait until the pressure pin drops and open the lid, being careful to tip it away from you.There is a bit of a learning curve for the first few uses of any electric pressure cooker, so have some patience. I find the Facebook group “Instant Pot Community” to be extremely helpful.This isn’t your grandma’s old pressure cooker. It’s smart, safe, and versatile. You can sauté your veggies in a little oil, throw in the meat, and reset the pot to pressure cook... resulting in a tasty meal in under an hour. AND, once it’s done cooking, it will keep your food warm for up to 10 hours. There is a delay feature, too. You can buy a variety of accessories to stack and cook different items in their own containers, or make egg bites, hard boiled eggs, cheesecakes, lasagna, and much more.The recipe book that comes with the pot is minimal — just a teaser compared to what’s available online and in Facebook groups.The power cord detaches from the base, so make sure it’s firmly plugged in when you start cooking. The silicone gasket on the lid will pick up odors, and many people buy extras to use with their different foods (savory or sweet). If you find yourself using the slow cooker feature a lot, you can opt to buy a clear lid (which is NOT used for pressure cooking).I hope you enjoy your Instant Pot as much as I do! Don’t be afraid of it. I find it much less intimidating (pressure-wise) than my metal, stove top version."
3.0 out of 5 stars,"Owning two Instant Pots, I thought this a logical purchase.  I am disappointed.  The volume held is low and it takes quite a while to even make french fries.  Making them in my oven is much faster ( convection gas oven) and I can say the quality is also superior.  It did do a good job with a couple of pieces of breaded fish, but that's not something we normally eat, so not really a plus for us.  I am returning it.  I love my Instant Pots, though."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have made soups, rice, chicken, bread, cake, all sorts of things in this guy. My mom had a pressure cooker before I bought this and got rid of it because it was a pain to use. I showed her how my Instant Pot works and she couldn't believe how simple it was to use. I bought the 8qt, which so far has been perfect for feeding a family of four - some leftovers, but not much and not every time. I've read some people keep two of the sealing bands around, one for sweet and one for savory, but I've been using the same one for both and have noticed no difference. The sealing band definitely retains smells though. I made a spicy lentil soup a while ago and the band smelled like that through multiple cookings until I made split pea - now it's smells like split pea lol. Doesn't impact cooking, and I'm cleaning the band appropriately, it's just a normal occurrence with that type of material, so don't panic when yours does that. Would definitely recommend, speeds up cooking times dramatically."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have used a pressure cooker most of my married life (50+ years) but this is the best one I have ever had. No worry about the pressure being too high or too low because you can't get the stove heat adjusted just right. We live in an RV and having an appliance do more than one job is absolutely essential when you have a lack of storage space. I was able to get rid of my slow cooker and my pressure cooker and replace them both with this marvelous pot! This past weekend we went to a potluck and I made deviled eggs - using 2 dozen eggs. The one part of preparing the eggs is the hardboiling of them and the peeling. Most of the time the eggs do not peel well. This time I steamed them in the Instant Pot and they cooked beautifully and peeled with no problem. Every egg was perfectly cooked and peeled. If I didn't use it for anything else, it was well worth the price. I will be using it for lots of other cooking lots of other things. I have used the rice cooker and it makes wonderful and tasty rice that is not mushy or undercooked. I have cooked chicken and pork in it using both the slow cooker and the pressure cooker selections. I have not been disappointed with any the recipes I have cooked. I would definitely recommend purchasing one."
5.0 out of 5 stars,Update: one year later and still going strong and getting used on the daily. I absolutely love this pressure cooker it cuts down cooking time and it’s so easy to clean. My mother in law loves it so much she bought 2 for herself.After going through a Navarro and Walmart pressure cookers I decided to go for the Instand Pot and I absolutely love it. I’ve given it a few months before I wrote this to make sure it didn’t let me down and it hasn’t. The cooker gets used DAILY at my house for a lot of things and nothing gets stuck at the bottom. I’ve even used the pot alone on the stove to make mango marmalade since I didn’t have a bigger pot and it was super easy to clean afterwards.  It cooks very fast and has options for the amount of time/pressure for preset Options which is great for rice in particular because it doesn’t need the amount it has preset.

I am Indian, have a high pressure full-time job and I have a toddler to take care of. I like to cook and cook a lot. I can literally count the number of times we eat out per year. My husband is Vegan and I have tested and tried several recipes successfully but have always wished some brilliant mind would design a pressure cooker that is exactly like the Instant Pot -Stainless steel (for healthy cooking), easy to clean manually (this takes less than a minute to wash!), dishwasher safe, easy to understand settings, large (to cook for a large gathering), no mess at all on the cooker's lid (versus a huge mess that I have been dealing with for years now), cooks really fast, cooks really slow (when I want that - in 'slow cooker' mode), is a rice cooker/pressure cooker/slow cooker/soup pot - all in one!!The Instant Pot is just that and much more. It has several cooking modes (Steam, saute, multigrain, pressure cooking, slow cooking, yogurt maker) and a ton of other settings. It has been a big hit so far with every single thing I have tried. I have tried making brown rice in different rice cookers and in several different pressure cookers which almost always used to end up in a mess. At the end of it, the brown rice would not even be cooked. I almost had told myself that I would never end up making brown rice successfully my entire life. With almost ""no effort"" at all on my part, I have been making brown rice in the Instant Pot and it has been turning out so well!Being Indians, lentils ('dals') are a staple food. Both the lid and the base of my old pressure cooker would get messed up almost every time I used it. The 'dal' would not get cooked but we had to spend a lot of time scrubbing the lid as well as the base of the cooker. The Instant Pot is a blessing. Anything I say about it is not going to be enough. You have to buy and see the difference yourself as it works its magic. I have tried making several curries, steaming veggies, etc and it was magical - at least for me.The only drawback I see is that someone with less counter space in the kitchen may find this to be a little bulky. I am big into style and looks and tend to go for contemporary styling with the smallest of things I buy. Instant Pot is the only exception to that. Because of how much it can simplify your life, I am okay with this looking a little bulky. Despite the fact that it takes up space, I would recommend this to anyone because if you own this, you should be able to give away multiple cookers/appliances that you may own. The Instant Pot can easily replace a slow cooker + a pressure cooker + a rice cooker and probably a few more appliances/cookers you may own. I have not even been using my stove top and the usual pans that I used quite frequently (before) ever since Instant Pot came into my life. Most of cooking happens inside the IP.  You will love it too."
3.0 out of 5 stars,The unit is nice for cooking rice and so far I've found it to be just OK for the other foods I've tried so far.  The instructions are somewhat confusing and you cannot adjust the time for the rice cooking feature.  The manual states 4 minutes for some rices and the least amount of time you can do is 8 minutes so I had to use a timer and press cancel and HOPE the rice turned out OK and it did.  A 4 quart would definitely be a better size.  The saute feature is nice and you can saute before using the pressure cooker feature.  I have yet to try the slow cooker feature.  Maybe this one will impress.  I've made a few messes utilizing the quick pressure release as the unit spits and sputters all over the place.  You HAVE to let it sit before moving the gauge to the quick release or else you end up with a mess.  You can't run the pot under water and release the pressure as you can with conventional pressure cookers.  Glad I bought it on sale and sorry I didn't find one for about $30 at an estate or garage sale because this is about what I think this unit is worth.  It's difficult to find recipes on line for this little guy.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"My wife absolutely loves this device.  We have done a solid two weeks of daily dinner just in this unit.  There's tons of available recipes online and an endless amount of options with this unit.  I would recommend this size over the smaller one (6qt) just for the flexibility.  People are ""scared"" of pressure cookers for some reason but they're seriously a great tool and relatively safe to use.  When you can have a complex thing like risotto come out of this and it's perfectly done, that's a huge win in my book.  The only upgrade from this unit would be an ""air-fryer"" lid.  But that's so situational, this one does 95% of what we needed it to do.  This would be great for dorm or travel cooking too."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"So glad I have this. I got the 3 quart one which is perfect for a family of 2 with with with a baby. I love the size. I already have an xl multicooker so I wanted something small that i could use everyday. I have been making non dairy Soy yogurt once a week and its enough for the whole week, 2 servings a day (i am yogurt crazy lol), i also made an egg quiche and I basically cook with it everyday. Not just for pressure cooking. I love cooking something and keeping it warm. I love the stainless steel liner. Very happy with the size, for those complaining its too small, read the description before buying something lol its called mini for a reason."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I didn’t expect this to be life changing but holy cow, I’ve been using it multiple times a day every day since it arrived about a month ago. I’m sad when it’s in the wash and temporarily out of commission. It cooks almost everything faster and better than a traditional oven or stovetop with virtually no preheat time and doesn’t add a lot of heat to the kitchen (perfect for summer). The dehydrator function is fun to play around with and get different textures from. It’s a good size for cooking for 2 people but I imagine would be a little strained or require multiple batches for more."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love love love my instant pot. I bought it like 2 years ago. it never made me disappointed. I had a manual pressure cooker but an instant pot different than anything else. while I was in love with my pressure cooker, I found an air fryer lid. I used it like 5 times. All of them turned beautiful and healthy. I can not say they are tasty as fried but they are healthier to eat and cleaner to make. I am using my instant pot for making yogurts almost twice a week. They are really delicious. #make#your#own#yoghurt#at#home."
1.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased this to replace a bargain brand electric pressure cooker that I used for years, so I am by no means new to the technique. I expected a slight learning curve while I became familiar with the cycles and general layout. BUT...this thing cooks very inconsistently and specified cook times are WAY OFF! Don’t expect to find any general cooking guidelines in the very minimal product information included with the machine. You’ll have to hunt them down online and hope you’ve found a reliable recipe. Last night I attempted to make a frozen pork loin and calculated the cooking time by multiplying its weight by the suggested minutes per pound. The result was a severely overcooked, dry, and inedible roast that got fed to the dogs. Yet after making hundreds of pounds of mashed potatoes in my cheapo cooker over the years, the potatoes coming out of the IP were still hard after the typical cook time. I ran them through an entire second cycle and managed to get them mashable, but I could have made them on the stovetop in the same time! I’m very disappointed with this! Perhaps the brand hype compromised the quality of the products currently coming into the marketplace. Sure wish I could have found a replacement part for my old reliable one! Seriously considering packing this up and returning! I want something I can count on working!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I’ve been loving to use my IP!! I watched many YouTube videos on how it operates, and for recipes before I tried the Water Test in Dec 2019. I have been making impressively quick and delicious meals and snacks, and they have come out wonderful! The egg bites, and egg loafs, in general, took a few tries to get them right, but adding a little more cook time corrected the problem. I think  cook times vary, depending on where you’re located? Idk, but I start off with the suggested times, and if it’s undercooked, I place the lid back on, lock it, and just cook it longer. For the most part, everything comes out perfect, and in such little time. I’ve made whole chickens with veggies, stews, soups, rice, potatoes, carrots, taco meat, eggs, and I’m going to try yogurt and cakes next. If you get one, you’ll love it! There’s lots of YouTube videos on how to use it, problem solving, and recipes, and there’s lots of FB groups to join and learn more. It’s such a worthwhile appliance, and after all is cooked, it’s SO SO easy to clean!! One pot shop!!"
1.0 out of 5 stars,Bought this for my mother at her request to replace our classic crock pots and it's my biggest regret in terms of kitchen appliance purchases. Nearly always catches in one of us with steam that's extremely hot it even melted part of its own top at one point so well it still works it doesn't look that nice. The pressure cooking is nice but everything else I haven't really used. I make soups and chilis far less because I hate using it so much that I've gone back to cooking them on the stove rather than use this. Save yourself a lot of money and go to your nearest Target or Walmart and buy yourself a $25 crock pot.
5.0 out of 5 stars,Love this product so far - 1 month into using it for large dog food chicken cooking and just large volume cooking in general but are there replacement bowls?I want to buy another stainless bowl
2.0 out of 5 stars,"I initially loved this pot when I got it. It cooked quickly and evenly. However, after the 1st month the nozzle to select vent or no venting keeps moving. I'd have it on no venting for pressure cooking and then it will slowly move itself to venting within a few minutes and steam will escape...ruining my food. Now I have to stay close by so I can turn it back to no venting which can be dangerous because the steam is extremely hot and can burn. I'm really disappointed."
1.0 out of 5 stars,"The time recommended to ""fry"" 2 pieces of chicken was 20 minutes.  It took longer than 20 minutes for 2 pieces of chicken and I had 6 pieces to cook - -would have been so much easier and a lot less fuss to just bake these 6 pieces of chicken in the oven - in 20 minutes!I bought this because it would not be another appliance to add to the kitchen, thought it would be good to just add this lid to the Instant pot that I already had and that was pretty good - it is a big lid, took a bit to find where to store it, but when it did not work as planned it was sure easy to return with no regrets."
3.0 out of 5 stars,"A useful product, letting us cook beans in an evening instead of starting them one night (soaking) and finishing them the next (cooking for a couple hours). This completes the process in an hour or so. Various beans have been the most frequent occupant of the pot. Others include soups and stews, which are done in a jiffy.Minus 2 stars for the confusing directions on how to set time or kind of cooking. Some day I'll make a million by taking a week to figure the directions out, and rewriting them into ""useful and understandable"". It's almost as if they don't want you to use the equipment."
1.0 out of 5 stars,"System always read ""burn"".  I tried EVERYTHING and could not get the pot to cook as the ""smart"" pot stops heating till the ""burn"" light was off."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased this Instant Pot to make cooking quicker and easier for me now that I have been diagnosed with Celiac disease.With all of the thousands of reviews here on Amazon I figured how could I go wrong. I didn't.There are to many uses for this pot to mention in one single review. In fact I there is not much more that I could add to this review that hasn't already been said,The functionality of this is pretty simple and straightforward. The cookbook that comes with this is pretty generic but will get you started on some simple items.I have found numerous websites devoted to the use of the instant pot and many great gluten free recipes.This will cook food fast as it says it will. One thing to note, you need to allow time for the first initial heat up before the timer starts. If you  get ahead of the book and skip over parts you might miss that part like I did. I thought something was wrong and it wasn't working. Just wait and the timer will start. It took mine 15 minutes to heat up the first time. Now I know.Also a note about cooking gluten free pasta. You will have to adjust your water or moisture content. You will have to use less water than what is called for or you will have a mushy mess. Most gluten free recipes containing pasta will tell you what and how much to add. Do that and then tweak your own recipes,You will love it and enjoy it once you have learned how to use it. Enjoy!Yep, I PAID FULL PRICE. This is MY OPINION good or bad. I am not affiliated with anyone but me. I’m  AMZ Prime and I hope I helped you come to an easier decision."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"This thing is cool and very useful, but often it gets put away in the pantry and over looked for other kitchen appliances. I also had lots of drama with Amazon when I tried to purchase this on prime day. There system kept crashing and by the time it was back up they where sold out. So i called and was told to buy it and call after i get it and would be given a refund of the differance. Needless to say 3 different customer service people told me 3 different things and did not record/write down anything they told me so each one treated me like I made the whole thing up. I almost canceled prime that day. Eventually the refunded like 90% of the differance. I was not happy and this changed my mostly glowing impression of all other encounters with amazon customer service. But again as far as the product goes this works great I just dont use it alot. too many kitchen gadgets i guess."
1.0 out of 5 stars,WOW THE PRODUCT WORKED GREAT! UNTIL ONE DAY IT JUST STOPPED WORKING. NOW MY INSTANT POT IS DEAD AND THE DISPLAY WON’T TURN ON. BUT FOR NINE MONTHS IT WORKED GREAT!I RECOMMEND THAT YOU GET THE EXTENDED WARRENTY AND DON’T TRUST THAT YOUR INSTANT POT WILL BE TROUBLE FREE LIKE I DID.THEY JUST DON’T BUILD STUFF LIKE THEY USED TO.
1.0 out of 5 stars,"I've used this 3 times and so far I am not impressed. After the 3rd washing the frier basket is peeling and bubbling paint. That makes me very worried as to what is seeping into my food. I don't get all the rave reviews. Seems if you want something to taste ""Fried"" It has to be pre-fried and frozen. I thought the point was avoiding oil frying for healthier meals/snacks? So if you take a bag of pre-fried frozen sweet potato fries and pop them in here they are great. If you cut up a fresh sweet potato and put it in here, it's soggy with the tiny bits being crispy. Basically this thing is nothing a toaster oven hasn't done for years. If you own a toaster oven I don't recommend this. If you own a real oven I don't recommend this. If you live in an efficiency/studio with little to no cook space, this is great. It's compact and can do the work of an oven. Overall I would not recommend this product and if I hadn't thrown the box away I would return it."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"I got this on the advice of world famous blogger, Nom Nom Paleo. I am quite impressed with this machine.First, rice. I did a split test on this, comparing rice cooked in the Instant Pot with my stovetop version. I'm not picky about my rice, but I gotta say, the Instant Pot did it better, albeit not much faster, but better and without any fuss or guessing.Second, yogurt. Can't say I'm super impressed. First attempt was a failure. I kept checking the temperature and found that Instant Pot quit heating at 170 degrees F, 10 degrees below boiling. I don't believe it was quite hot enough. The second attempt was much more successful - instead of using Instant Pot to heat the milk, I used the stovetop and let the milk and starter incubate in the Instant Pot ... for eight hours. Took longer, but whatever. Tastes great.Pressure cooker. A whole chicken in 20 minutes. What's not to love about that? No, really, what's not to love? My chill is ON at dinner time now.Steam. It worked. I wish I'd left my frozen veggies in the steamer longer, but we're not strangers to cold food. (Check it: Left over rice, left over chicken, steamed veggies in a bowl topped with a little Trader Joe's Masala in a jar. Good eats.)Haven't tried it with multigrain (wild rice) or slow cooker or porridge, but I'm not worried at all, and I'm getting to it. But first, another 20-minute chicken, please!"
3.0 out of 5 stars,"I thought I would leave a review for people like me that though that an air fryer would produce results close to that of a deep fryer. A air fryer is essentially a convection oven, I'm sure if you have a toaster oven with a convection function you will produce similar results. It produces a crisp outer shell on the food but still cannot compare to deep frying,It lacks the flavor and moistness of the deep fryer. Obviously battered foods are a no go also.If you know what you are getting into. This product is built well and it's easy to use and doesn't smell up the house. Although don't expect to fit more than an appetizer portion in it."
5.0 out of 5 stars,I was so excited when I saw they came out with this air fryer lid. We just don’t have the counter space for a normal air fryer and we already own an instant pot so I wasn’t about to buy a second one just to get the air fryer attachment. We’ve used this thing multiple times so far and it hasn’t disappointed us yet. It’s so easy to use and things seem to cook fairly quickly with it. I love that it saves the last time and temp that I put into the digital display so I’m not having to redo it each time when I’m making things in batches. My guys love that they can have “fried” food again that tastes good and isn’t coated in grease. Definitely worth the money we spent!
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I absolutely love this Instant Pot. I can make 2 dozen steamed (hard boiled) eggs that peel like a dream every time. It makes the most perfect baked potatoes. I made the most delicious stew that tasted like it had been simmering for hours. I was really disappointed that I couldn't find one with a larger capacity as we have a very large family. However, I discovered that the quick cooking makes it ideal for making a large meal. I made a very large corned beef roast the other day. I was able to cook the roast in the liquid first. Then I took the roast out and covered it with foil. I filled the IP completely with potatoes and carrots in the same juice the roast had cooked. They came out tasting just like I had made the entire thing together. This was a huge bonus because I usually can't fit very many potatoes and carrots around a roast in the crock pot. I ended up with at least double the sides for my family than can be accomplished in a crock pot. Unfortunately, I couldn't fit all of the extra cabbage on top. Not a worry. Only a minute by itself in the IP with the juice and I had an entire head of cabbage to go along with the rest. I truly love it!Some of the reviews posted complaints about it not working or coming to pressure after the warranty had expired. Amazon offers a very reasonable extended warranty. I purchased one with this item to ensure that I wouldn't be out the money I invested if it should fail in the next two years."
2.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought the instant pot duo 8 quart in 2017 and it was the v.1 model. I made everything in it and it worked well for about a year and then it broke. I called the company and basically they told me they would do nothing because it was out of warranty. I decided to buy a new one and it happened to be the v.2 model. It burns everything. Every time unless it’s soup. I called the company and they would not offer to exchange it. Their big idea was to add extra oil and water to each recipe and cook on low pressure. Guess what? It ruined all my recipes and still burned the food. Apparently they changed the heating apparatus in this new version of the 8 quart and even when  I carefully deglaze, it burns everything. Instant pot won’t do anything about it."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Although it can be a bit pricey, the Instant Pot is a fabulous appliance to have when cooking in a reduced sized kitchen or dorm. Also it is great for students, athletes, and working people who need to start a meal early in the day and don't have time to tend to it or cook during the day. Meal prep-wise as a collegiate athlete, the Instant Pot has made a world of difference in meal prep- I've used it to make Bolognese/spaghetti squash from scratch, chili, pulled pork for tacos, turkey stock, roasted pork tenderloin, and many soups which is a lifesaver in the busy winter/competition season.It's worth noting that there's a genuine learning curve to the Instant Pot and it is advised to follow recipes for the first time you use it.Additionally, the size is perfect for dorm storage and makes enough to feed a small family, a few roommates, or a single person for ~4 meals on most dishes."
5.0 out of 5 stars,I love this air fryer. Would highly recommend. Everything I have made has turned out great. This has made my instant pot more versatile I like when you take the hot lid off it has its own tray to sit it on. Also not very noisy
5.0 out of 5 stars,"People my age often remember how our mothers stood over the pressure cooker, watching carefully, fearfully. That has been our concept of a pressure cooker.  And so after I purchased this Instant Pot, I was fearful.  I joined groups online and watched youtube videos before doing the ""water test"".  Then, I let go of the fears and started cooking.  I made two styles of pork roast to begin, but since then have made so much more!  It's great!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I had tried a pressure cooker earlier and didn't like it.  A colleague was raving about her Insta-Pot and convinced me to try it.  Wow--I love this thing.  It may be my favorite appliance ever.  I suppose it does save time, but the most important thing for me is to be able to cook the food quickly without having to babysit it!  Pasta isn't going to boil over.  Eggs aren't going to crack and come out either too done or too raw.  I love the fact that it keeps food warm for as long as you need.  The 3 qt. mini has turned out to be perfect for two or three people, so it doesn't take much valuable counter space.  If you're in doubt about getting one of these gadgets, take the plunge!  You won't be sorry."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"I love my Instapot.  I purchased this one because I needed a bigger one. The original one we had was just a bit too small.  While this one works the same way as the smaller one does, this bigger one has a tendency to scorch the food or the liquid at the bottom of the pot when using a thick sauce, like tomatoe sauce or something like it.  The food/sauce is more likely to burn if you use the saute feature first. The instructions say that if you saute first, allow the unit to cool down before you begin adding the remaining ingredient. This does seem to help keep the food from burning at the bottom of the pot.  You also might want to thin down the sauce too.  Ive found that helps too.  That being said, I still love the Instapot. I'm just more careful when cooking with sauces. I wouldn't trade this Instapot for anything."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"When I bought this Instant Pot during the frigid Montana winter, I thought it would come in handy for making comforting soups and stews on busy work nights, but it's become my favorite kitchen tool even during the warmer weather.  This is a quality made product and I am very happy with it.  Some reviewers recommend buying an extra silicone lid seal to use for cooking desserts, as the seal does absorb the fragrance of savory, herbal and garlic seasoned dishes, but I just remove the seal after use and spray it with white vinegar and wait a few minutes before rinsing and it cleans up practically odor free between uses."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"After years of being afraid of pressure cookers, I decided to buy one.  It is nothing like your mother or grandmother’s pressure cooker.  By leaving it out on the counter and not putting it away I discovered that it is the only way I was going to keep using this.  There are so many online supports with recipe and ideas it is actually fun to experiment and connect with others.  There is a whole world of Instant Pot fanatics.  So do not be afraid.......You either love it or hate it.  Take it from someone who hates to cook......take a chance.  Your family will thank you for it."
1.0 out of 5 stars,"This item is well made, seems safe, if you take the time to read the instructions, and versatile.  My problem is< I just don't really like the texture of the food cooked in the pot.  It's stringy and sort of ""over done.""  The stainless steel inner pot is very sturdy and  very easy to clean.  BUT, the lid and the inner rim of the pot are very difficult to get clean.  Grease and junk get deep in the crevices and it's a time consuming process to get the gunk out.  You have to use a folded paper towel to get in the tight creases, or you're going to regret it later.I really don't like this, I'm going to give it to my daughter."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Pros and cons at the top, full story after.Pros:- Easy to use- Incredible versatile- Meal prep is now a breeze and takes me less than a whole day- SO. MUCH. RICE. I can now actually make a variety rice without burning it or undercooking it. This is amazing.- It sounds like a teeny space ship when you put on or remove the lid and lock/unlock it! I love it.Cons:- WHY DOES IT STILL SMELL LIKE RICE AFTER I CLEANED IT TO KINGDOM COME- Kind of a pain to clean around the rim of the main unit. Will gladly take suggestions on how to do that though, I'm pretty sure it's user error at this point.I thought this thing was just hype and ridiculousness.I was so, so very wrong, y'all.The backstory:I was given a $100 visa gift card and a touching personal note from work for Christmas - a stunning bonus compared to my previous jobs where I either was given a $15 gift card for the grocery store I worked at FOR FOUR YEARS or $35 dollars cash and a hoodie emblazoned with the pizza shop's logo at the pizzeria I had a brief stint at. I sat on this surprise extra money for a while, trying to decide what to use it on - clothes? Nah, I'd recently swapped my wardrobe out, and I was set for a while. I was still starting my miniatures hobby, so I wasn't set on paints yet...But then I saw this beauty of a machine. At the time of purchase, it was on sale so I think it was maybe $60-$70 dollars after taxes and such. I hesitated at first, because this was a considerable machine and my kitchen is not exactly massive.Then I realized it could also replace my ancient crock pot aaaaand that more or less sold it to me.It arrived relatively quickly and I got to assembling it and cleaning the inner metal pot. I was stunned that it wasn't bigger - 6 qts sounds so much larger than it is, but my old crock pot is maybe a 3 qt machine. It comes with a full instruction manual (a blessing), a quick start guide (also a blessing), a recipe book (!!!!!!), and a short note version for the times most things need to cook in the Instant Pot. I do question some of the times inside, but I'll trust the experts.To date, I have now used this thing more times in the past six months than I have used my old crock pot or rice cooker in two or three years. I've made roasts, pulled pork, rice, homemade ramen, chicken stock - while I definitely need to get into a better rhythm with using it more consistently, it has been wonderful to have. Wholeheartedly recommend it, kind of wish I'd gotten the 3 qt size but the 6 qt is more useful for soups and larger batches of food for meal prep."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"I loved my instant pot when I first got it, I used it for literally everything from salmon to rice and beans. I don’t use it much anymore because I don’t cook much anymore. It’s nice to have when you’re cooking multiple things at once, you can have the rice in the pot, taco meat and tortillas on the stove. I did burn myself pretty badly once so make sure you switch it from pressure cooking to venting carefully. It made the best salmon I’ve ever had."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"I like this a lot. Is great because our kitchen has limited space right now and we didn't want to buy a whole separate air fryer. I'd say drawbacks are the cooking surface size is limited (obviously) by the shape of the IP. It's also pretty tricky to remove the tray right after cooking something to access both levels. The tray has some finger holes in it, but when it's hot you're not going to use your fingers to lift it, meanwhile the finger holes aren't really shaped well for any type of tool other than the tines of a fork to kinda shimmy it out."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"This is a review for the MINI instant pot duo plus.I can’t believe how much this pot has improved my quality of life! Being someone with little to no cooking experience, so far I’ve made risotto and tomato beef stew with great results. (The beef was thoroughly cooked, tender without being dry!) The Instant Pot definitely takes the arm out of cooking, but with that being said, I’m not quite sure if it quickens the process. It takes time for the pressure to build, and even more time if you want the pressure to release naturally (you just wait until the button drops). It makes cooking so easy and cleaning up even easier, since you’re able to sauté and cook in the same pot. Good if you don't have a microwave too since you can reheat leftovers using the steam function, the wire rack, and a Pyrex/oven safe bowl!The mini version is more than enough for one person, and so far I haven’t had any problems with recipes not working! The pot is pretty heavy though even though it’s the mini version. All in all would recommend. (Took one star off because I'm not sure yet how well it'll hold up!)"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Oh my gosh - do I adore this!! I have every kitchen gadget imaginable - so I hesitated on getting yet another kitchen toy. I have to say how incredibly happy I am that I did. This is the most amazing kitchen product I've ever used (apologies to my other beloved appliances that have been moved aside). Even my husband has decided to start using it too because he's seen me have so much fun with it - and has thoroughly enjoyed the delicious food I've been making.  I wasn't sure what size to buy - 6 qt or 8 qt - as there are only 2 of us to cook for. It's the perfect size. The 6 qt makes about 4 good sized servings. I've tried at least 5 of the 7 functions (still have to cook eggs and rice, jury is out on yoghurt at the moment). The best dish so far has been Pho. Never would I have ever tried making Pho - but it is fabulous using this pot (look up Instant Pot Faux Pho on the internet). I did buy extra gaskets at others recommendations. This looks to be a pretty sturdy piece of equipment for the home kitchen, but it isn't commercial grade (the outer jacket would have to be much sturdier).  I imagine this could very well be the only cooking appliance needed in a tiny home, camping trailer or other small kitchen.  I'm doing most of my cooking in this pot alone now.  I can't wait to try out some of the desserts - like the cheesecake - and some of the breads next. Have fun with your purchase. You'll be happier and healthier incorporating it into your culinary life."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I stumbled across this from a FB group.  I've owned my Instant Pot for years and love it.  I've been wanting an air fryer for years and when I found Instant Pot made an attachment for my existing pot, I knew I had to have it. I've made so many things with this attachment that I think it is becoming my most used item in my kitchen.  Clean up is super easy and it works perfectly.  So happy I discovered this on Amazon!!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I just received my IP Air Fryer lid for my LUX 6 qt. A 6qt air fryer would’ve been more expensive and would’ve taken up much more room. So far, I’ve made air fried brussel sprouts. The end result was so good, even my meat and tater man went for seconds! The unit comes with a basket, dehydrator plate, and a protective cover for the lid. Easy to clean and easy to use. This was money well spent!"
3.0 out of 5 stars,"I really like my Instant Pot but it stopped holding pressure after about a year of use, and I only use my a few times a month.  I contacted Instant Pot directly, which is what they request you to do in their paperwork, and never heard back from them. I waited about eight days and contacted Amazon.  Within 2 days I had my replacement.  I can access my support service ticket online with Instant Pot, but I still have not heard back from them."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Cooked a large pork roast to fall apart tender in about 40 minutes instead of hours in the oven.  Can sear and roast in same pan - saves on clean up.  Alerts you if your meat is in danger of burning.  That is such a blessing.  I'm dairy intolerant so I won't use yogurt maker.  Can make whole meal - meat, rice, veggies all together, just add rice and veggies at appropriate time.  There are tons of free recipes on the internet.  Would definitely recommend to friends and family.  I am so delighted that when I broke by 44 year blender jar, I ordered the instapot blender, which also had delighted me."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I am very excited on moving on from my NuWave Air Fryer to this new Instant Pot Duo Mini 3 Quarter (size) 9-in-1 cooker!  It came less than 4-days with brand new manufacturers’ box and I saved OVER $45!  I am a single mom of toddlers and twin newborns, and I already found the Instant Pot recipe APP and using it to create organic vegetable foods for my 18-month old daughters!  I absolutely LOVE the lightweight, size, and find the preset cooking option buttons easier to use than other multi-function cookware!  I’ve done the water test already when I got it through delivery and will buy the ingredients to make the dishes!"
3.0 out of 5 stars,"I find the item convenient and effective but I have only used it 3 times. Once to cook chicken stew, once to make pot roast and once to make brownies. The rubber ring that seals the top already has an oder that can not be cleaned away. I was warned about the odor but didn't thing too  much of it because I figured as long as I soaked it in vinegar and or lemon juice after each use I would be fine. Boy was I wrong! I have never left the ring in the pot for more than 5 minutes after I was done using it and immediately soaked the ring afterwards for hours. This had no effect on reducing the odor. I would have scored it a five if this were not an issue."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Never knew how useful such an item could be- my son got one for his studio (he doesn't have an oven or any appliances), and cooks everything in it- shredded chicken breast in less than 20 minutes, etc. So my daughter got one, and steams vegetables, cooks meat, you can even make yogurt. She made us short ribs in less than 20 minutes! They were fantastic. This is way better than a crock pot. You can even quickly cook frozen meats. We are in love with this- doesn't use as much electricity as a stove or oven, and doesn't heat up our hot house. Worth gold."
1.0 out of 5 stars,Today I received the instant pot after all the excitement and anxiety when I opened the box it’s seemed to be damaged.
5.0 out of 5 stars,I can't believe that I love this thing. All my friends were getting them and raving about it. But I absolutely hate my slow cooker and I figured this device would be much the same. I finally decided to get one when my friend posted that she had made amazing carnitas in it. My husband is Mexican and carnitas are his favorite food so I thought I'd get one to try it out and hope everyone was right. I was pretty terrified of it at first but I read a bunch of Facebook posts about it and that made it less intimidating. The first thing I made (after the water test) was the carnitas and they KNOCKED OUR SOCKS OFF. Then I made rice and it came out better than my old rice cooker. Tonight I made Country Ribs and the entire family went wild. I've had this IP for roughly 48 hours and I'm already using it for a fourth time right now to make oatmeal. Get one. You will not be sorry.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love this! Start to finish times are different than the “pressure cook time” so don’t be fooled by that but the time is sooo much faster than before and so much more convenient!Four minute rice for example is not ready in four mins. You have to let the machine warm up, pressurize and then cook for four mins and then depressurization time. So about 25 mins to have hard rice ready for the table, much fast than other methods.Not having to soak your beans and having them to the table in 30mins-1hr vs. several hours is just amazing!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm not a big fan of cooking. Baking? Yes. This baby does both with ease. I'm much more likely to take my turn making meals for the family with my Instant Pot. I've also made countless cheesecakes and lava cakes for dessert. I've also made lots of Starbucks knock-off egg bites and I've recently started to make yogurt, which is super easy. I would strongly recommend this product.Along with the pot itself, I purchased extra sealing rings to keep one for meat/rice/meal items and another for sweets, and now the third for yogurt. Otherwise, the flavors tend to leak into other foods. I also purchased a 7"" springform pan for cheesecakes and some silicone baby food freezer trays for my egg bites."

4.0 out of 5 stars,"I got this because of the hubbub surrounding it as the new “it” gadget for the kitchen. While I haven’t yet gotten a feel for how to use it properly for full meals, there are three side dishes I use it for regularly that it is pretty awesome for: corn on the cob, potatoes, and, in particular, rice.It’s basically the world’s best rice cooker, and anything else it does is just extra. I put in two cups each of rice and water, half a stick of salted butter cubed up and distributed around the pot, and a little bit of salt, and just use the built-in program for rice. It turns out perfect every time, and it’s so much easier than messing with a pot and a timer.I’ll eventually start looking into things like pulled pork or beef stew, but for now it’s already a win as far as I’m concerned."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"I love this as much as I do my instant pot!  I had an old second hand air fryer that was so hard to clean that I finally pitched it.  This is so much easier to keep clean as long as you do not spray it with propellant spray oils which ruin the finish on the basket, eventually. Being able to switch from cooking to browning in the same device is a joy!  I just wish it was a bit bigger."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I was urged to try the Instant Pot since I spend so much time standing at the stove to prep bbq ribs the old fashioned way...it took hours and then it still needed grilling outside.  But family loved it.  The instant pot took 25 minutes for 10 pounds, fall off the bone, and delicious!  I watched YouTube for suggestions and modified recipe to our liking.  Made spaghetti, took 8 minutes, and it was delicious also.  Not scared of the pressure cooker, freed me from the kitchen, and still make delicious meals!  Win win all the way."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I absolutely love this thing. I have made everything from ribs, steak, soup, rice, eggs, to  crème brûlée and everything in between in this pot. It saves so much time cooking. I cooked/ prepped 90% of easter dinner in it. What a life and time saver. My husband and I love one pot meals and this does the trick. The only thing I don't like is the pot will hold the scent the last cooked meal, yuck. It doesn't alter the flavor of the next but thats kinda gross. This makes me wonder about the quality of the stainless steel. I thought the 8qt might be too big for just myself and hubby but it's great having the extra room when I need it."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"My wife comes from a rice loving culture and was missing having a proper rice cooker like is standard in her home country. Most of the cookers that are comparable to what she wanted were as or more expensive than this machine. The first time she made rice with this she was amazed and overcome with joy at both the quality of the rice (rice is rice to me so hard for me to judge) and how quickly it was made. The fact that this machine can be used for so many things yet is so good at even a less common function like cooking rice it awesome. Get it, you will not be disappointed (unless you get one too small :p)"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"What an awesome idea! One unit takes the place of multiple products! You can use it as a pressure cooker as well as a slow cooker! Saves time and dishes because you can saute then cook in the same pot. It has a rice button, a soup button, you can even make homemade yogurt in it (there's a button for that, too!) There are so many recipes out there in books and online, you should never run out of options! My favorite thing to make in it is mashed potatoes! You can cook the potatoes and use a hand mixer right in the pot when they're done! This wonderful little gadget not only saves on time, but also saves on clean up because you don't need to wash as many dishes, and saves on space because it is so many things rolled into one! Great wedding gift or even for the college student or someone who may be moving a lot as well as someone who doesn't have a lot of storage space."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Before buying this, I would buy a family pack of boneless, skinless chicken thighs and cook them for hours in the crock pot. Then I would portion out the meat, freeze it and use it for various meals. The crock is heavy, and the plastic liners are a continual expense. This appliance is the easiest and fastest way to do what I want to do. It isn't heavy, the inner pot is lightweight, easy to wash and there are plenty of affordable accessories. There is also a Facebook page with over a million members who give advice and share recipes. Kindle has a great selection of pressure cooker cookbooks too.My 3# of partially frozen chicken thighs are cooking right now. They will be done in less than 20 minutes, plus time for a natural release. It took a few minutes for the pot to come to pressure, but what a difference to cooking them in the crock pot for hours and hours!I am considering buying the mini for desserts."
2.0 out of 5 stars,"I am having some difficulty with this pot. I want to love it, but it keeps failing me. First, as a slow cooker, I've just about written it off. It never gets hot enough, and even on high for 8-9 hrs, it will not slow cook a chicken for me. In my ancient crockpot (that finally fell apart) it would be falling off the bone in 4-5 hrs. So then I tried pressure cooking more often. My meat doesn't seem to be tender enough, but at least it's cooked. Until today. Today the pot acted like it was working, I heard the thing come up to pressure, but when I went to serve dinner, the chicken was still raw! I don't know why, because the pot came to pressure and started counting down the time, then released the pressure naturally. At a loss. Don't know if I have a dud??"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I am so glad that I purchased this product! I am literally obsessed with it and I haven't even began to use all of the options! The Instant Pot is really the only appliance you need to prepare great tasting and healthy dishes. In fact, my other appliances are feeling neglected bcuz I don't use them anymore! I love that I can make a dinner in a very short time. The prep takes the longest amount of time, then within 20 minutes you have an awesome meal. I suggest buying the Tempered lid and the cookbook along with it. The lid fits perfectly on the inner pot so that you can put it in the fridge easily. My chicken soup gets better and better every time I make it. I have never enjoyed leftovers until now. The 3 qt is the perfect size for me. It lasts me for a week. I think using the Instant Pot saves me a lot of money. This is a purchase you will not regret buying. That's a fact!! I'm looking forward to trying the Yogurt function and making many more of the dishes. One of the best things about the Pot is that you don't have to dirty a bunch of pots and pans. You Saute and put the ingredients in the pot, set the controls and you are done. The pot does all of the work! Easy to use and easy to clean.. I love this fantastic appliance. I bet you will too!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"When I bought this it was on prime day and so I ended up getting an amazing deal. I probably wouldn't have bought it if I didn't get such a great deal, but knowing what I know now, I would totally buy this item full price. My husband was irritated and thought it wasn't a good purchase or that we wouldn't use it, but he quickly changed his tune after I made several meals in it. I absolutely love it. I work long hours and so using a crockpot all day long doesn't always feel like the best idea and more than once a meal has been ruined/turned to mush. This allows me to cook things in only 1-2 hours and I have amazing pot roast or shredded pork, or even chili.If you don't already cook regularly, don't think that this device is going to make you want to cook more or make you a good cook. If you cook regularly and want something to use to cut your time down that is easy to use/clean then this is the product for you. I've made quit a few dishes in this thing(soup, curry, rice, taco meat, chili, pot roast, pulled pork, chicken breasts, veggies) and it always shocks me how fast and easy it is to use.I would say at this point, I use this device once or twice weekly, which is a huge deal for me. I still use my crock pot on weekends sometimes, but I much prefer this device!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,I LOVE my new instant pot as soon as I got it a did the recommended test which helps you get accustomed to the machine and breaks the ice. I then could not wait and wanted to cook something.  I had 7 large frozen boneless and skinless chicken breasts from jewel and figured it says you can go straight from frozen to delicious meals in no time without thawing etc.  So I did it. I placed all 7 large straight from freezer chicken breasts into the pot and set the machine. In less than 40 minutes I had the moistest and perfectly falling apart cooked chicken breasts like I have never had before. the machine is a super star and I will use it for everything I can.  I love this thing and its my first pressure cooker ever. I did my research online for all models pro's and con;s and settled for this brand and I am very happy I did.  Solid well built unit with tons of options that others lack. Plus this unit comes in not only 4 quart and 6 quart like most others but also has an 8 quart which is the one I purchased and and very pleased that I did.  Can never have to big a pot for those special occasions when you need to cook more than usual. This 8 quart can also cook things down to as small as 1 cup of rice perfectly.  I will be making all my meals in the instant pot not only for the taste and tenderness but also for the 95% vitamin retention it renders within all foods cooked in it.
1.0 out of 5 stars,"I ordered this product during prime days and got a good price on it. We have tried to cook with it several times. We followed the recipes to the letter as well as the settings on the instapot. Every time we have used the instapot the food/ recipe does not fully cook in the allotted time and we have to use the stove to finish the cooking process. Even something as simple as cooking artichokes required us to finish them on the stove. I am extremely dissatisfied with the Instapot and will try to get my money back. By the way, our neighbor gave up on her instapot as well."
2.0 out of 5 stars,"I fell for the Instant Pot hype. It's changed people's lives! They can now feed their family healthier meals; husbands suddenly love cooking; it's so easy to throw a few frozen pieces of meat in and then Bam! you have dinner. Friends, I hate to disappoint you, but this isn't the miracle machine that you've heard about. The reason I pulled the trigger on getting  the IP, after reading countless 5* reviews, was to replace my rice cooker. I was excited to open up the box and immediately popped rice and water and hit the Rice button. Makes sense, right? What was produced was a gelatinous goo with a layer of water in top. And I burned myself. Twice. The area in front of and behind the handle is blazing hot metal! (You've been warned!)But I was not deterred. I read the entire manual and recipe book, did the water test, and realized that this is NOT a convenient ""set it and forget it"" appliance like my old rice cooker or crock pot. This machine is as needy and demanding as a sugar-crazed toddler. After the pressure cooking process, there's a whole dance of quick releases, natural releases, keep warm settings and a bunch of hot steam and potentially dangerous burns this working mom doesn't have time for.I've tried at least half a dozen white rice recipes -- not free-styling it, actual blogs of people devoted to the IP movement -- with different time settings, different water to rice ratios, different brand of rice -- and none of them have given me delish results that I would share with my family. It's been too watery, unevenly cooked, or completely inedible. And unlike my rice cooker, the interior pot isn't nonstick so it's time consuming to clean out.The IP and I had one last date tonight before I broke up with him for good. A ""foolproof"" "" melt in your mouth tender"" beef roast. The kind of thing I can put in my crock pot before I leave for work in the morning and come home to a delicious dinner (with al dente potatoes and carrots) in rich gravy. After browning the beef, sauteing onions and layering potatoes on top, I set the magic machine for 70 minutes (per a recipe I found online). After 70 minutes plus a 10 minute natural release, I had a watery mess of unseasoned shoe leather and disintegrated potatoes. I fished out the potatoes and did another 25 minutes, plus another 10 minute natural release. Still tough as old boots and tasted about as good.I give the Instant Pot 4 stars for good construction (it's a solid, heavy machine). Functionality and convenience, zero stars. That averages out to what I think is a very fair 2 stars. I can't believe this is ALL user error. I mean, I'm not cooking sous vide or anything! Maybe I'm cooking things in too small quantities (like 2 cups of uncooked rice at a time)? Anyway, I'm not waiting around to find out what's wrong. The learning curve is just too steep and I'm just too busy to futz with another machine that's supposed to make my life easier but has actually added babysitting and cleaning time on top of my day.Epilogue: I have bought a new rice cooker and couldn't be happier."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"There's probably nothing I can say about the Instant Pot that hasn't been said before many times.  This thing is versatile and easy to use.  Steam, slow cook, pressure cook, saute, it does it all well.  I use this a lot to make batches of rice, two cups of rice and a two cups of water plus a splash extra.  Since it's a sealed cooker there is little water lost to evaporation and this 1:1 ratio works great for any variety of rice I've tried.My usage is frequent but fairly basic.  I gave one of these to my sister who is a more avid cook and she's done all kinds of meals with it.  I think the only limit to this cooker is your imagination.My only (minor) complaint is that cleaning the lid and outer pot can be a little difficult and it can tends to hang onto smells/flavors from previous jobs.  A big part of the challenge is the irregular shape required to make the seal, but with a brush it's really pretty easy to get into those spaces and clean them out.  It's really nice that the stainless steel inner pot is removable, it makes for easier cleaning, serving, transport and storing away leftovers in the fridge.I've got a fair amount of kitchen gadgets but this is the last one I'd give up."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"UPDATE:  It's been almost 2 years since I bought this, still going very well.  I'm still discovering more things to make in this instant pot!  For all yogurt and/or natto (Japanese fermented beans) makers out there, get this pressure cooker if you're looking for one!Few months ago, I was introduced to food called natto by my Japanese friend, and I fell in love.  I eat natto every morning with bowl of rice now.  Who would have thought! LOL.  Despite the stinky smell, it tastes great!  How should I describe it, hmmm... it's like stinky cheese, it smells so bad but tastes soooo good!  Is it also weird that I taste hint of coffee bean in the natto??  Well, it does for me, and I love it!Anyways, I eat so much natto now, I started making it after researching and getting recipe on the internet.  You need pressure cooker and a warmer (like yogurt maker) to make natto, and this instant pot has both features.  I love it!!So all you natto lovers out there, try making natto at home with organic, non-gmo soybeans, and get this instant pot.  Also, talk about all the health benefits of natto!  Go google it, you'll be surprised how good it does to your body.I wanted this for so long!  But I was concerned if I would use it often enough to make my moneys worth.  So I waited like a year debating weather I should or shouldn't buy it.  I didn't want to buy it mostly because I had slow cooker at home sitting in cablinet only to come out once or twice a year during cold seasons, and thought this pressure cooker will do the same.  WRONG!!!! Wow.. I so regret waiting so long to buy this!  I use it at least once a week!  I'm having so much fun cooking with this pressure cooker.  If you are like me and wondering, DON'T.  Just buy it, and you'll know what to do with it almost every week if not everyday."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is the perfect size for a 2 person family.  We can make chili without soaking the beans!  Also, we just 1/2 Instantpot recipes on the net and we still have leftovers for other days."
3.0 out of 5 stars,"i got the 3qt a few months ago, now just giving it a try.  Brown rice........first batch using the 1:1 ratio Instapot uses, was just awful little pebbles.  2nd batch, upped the water 25% and the time an additional 5 minutes on high, instead of low pressure.  better, but still not serve-worthy.  i added 1/2 cup of water and put the pot on again for 10 min.  so now we are up 35-40 min to make the rice, so this machine is no better than the stovetop method.  warning, the control panel does not give you a countdown on your timer.  so you need to set a separate timer if you want to know the status of your dish.  i have used a stove top pressure cooker for years, and this machine is no better.  i will use it for parties and holidays where stove space is at a premium, and if this machine dies......i will not replace it."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I was intimidated by this pot at first however after several attempts and reading about how it works online I have come to love it and use it almost daily. From oatmeal that o cam make and freeze on single servings to Dr. Pepper pork that cooks in 80Minutes and in a crock pot 8 hours, shredded chicken for taco bowels and egg bites for my child. I highly recommend this product. I set it up before we go to my sons baseball game and when I get home a delicious meal is waiting for us, no more fast food late night game endings. Also baked potatoes that I stiff with pulled chicken or pork are one of our favorites and the sauté feature makes it so I only use one pot for all the meal!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my second electric pressure cooker.  The first one worked well until the little button on the lid fell out and it wouldn't hold pressure anymore.  Over the years I've used stove top cookers and liked them ok, but after having an electric one, I felt I'd rather replace my ""broken"" one with electric rather than a stove top.  I'd been watching the infomercials on tv for another brand and was tempted to buy it, almost made the phone call, but stumbled upon the rating on Amazon, listing the Instant Pot as top rated.  I went back and read the reviews for the one on tv and while most seemed good, there were several negative ones.  The reviews for the Instant Pot were all good, and in reading nearly half of the [over] 300 reviews and finding them all positive, I decided to go with the Instant Pot even though it was more expensive.  When I got the notice that it had been shipped, I anxiously awaited it's arrival and had a pork roast ready and waiting!!  When it arrived, I went to YouTube to learn how long to cook the roast.  Most videos said about 45 minutes, so I sent the Instant Pot for 45 minutes and waited.  The first thing I noticed as it was cooking, was there was no sound and no smell.  Was It working?  I turned the release valve to Vent and sure enough, steam came out, so obviously it was working!  The no smell no sound thing could be good or bad depending on your point of view.  If you love the delicious smells of dinner cooking, your going to be disappointed, but if that's a non issue for you then it's not a problem.  At the end of the 45 minutes, I released the steam and opened the lid.  I was disappointed to find that the roast was not tender and yummy.  Fortunately, in my eagerness to try the IP out, I had started dinner early enough that I had plenty of time to run it through another 45 minutes.  After this second 45 minutes, I checked it again and still wasn't satisfied with it's doneness.  I put it on for another 30 minutes and when I opened the lid, I was Thrilled with the results!!  The fact that it ended up taking 2 hours for what I believed would take only 45 minutes was not a deterrent for me.  The roast was delicious, the vegetables I had put in after the first 45 minute go-round were done to perfection, and my husband was a very happy man that night!  From that night on, I used my Instant Pot every night for that first week.  I used it in slow cook mode twice and again found it needed extra time but did an excellent job of cooking a delicious meal.  My first electric pressure cooker had the non stick pot but in reading reviews for several brands, the requests and/or satisfaction with stainless steel pots was overwhelming, so that was one of the reasons I decided to go with the Instant Pot.  The stainless pot has a heavy, good quality feel to it and could even be used for cooking on the stove top if one wanted to do that.  I gave the Instant Pot a 5 star rating, but  would have preferred to give it 4 1/2 because of the longer cooking times required, but my stars got posted publicly before I could figure out how to do a half star.  In spite of the longer cooking times, I'm totally satisfied with the Instant Pot.  Meals take longer than they say, but still get finished much faster than cooking on the stove or oven, so I just make allowances for that extra time.  I love being able to put my food in the pot and walking away to go about my business without having to fuss with stirring and watching heat settings and all the things that go along with stove top or oven cooking.  I'm so happy with it, that I will be buying one for a wedding present for a good friend who just got married recently!  One thing I'd like to add, is that while I absolutely love the Instant Pot, I'm quite dissatisfied with the cookbook.  It's filled with things that I'm not likely to cook for my family.  While I do acknowledge that it's always fun to try new things, I'd like to see instructions for cooking more traditional things as well."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"The Instant Pot arrived promptly and in good shape. Well packaged. The main drawback we have had has just been corrected by the manufacturer: All the literature warned to follow the recipes in order to learn the proper, safe use. Yet, the recipes in the cookbooks downloaded from Kindle as well as those found online referred to buttons that did not exist on this latest version of the Instant Pot. That has just been corrected.So if you receive an Instant Pot without a manual button, or an adjust button, check their site. https://instantpot.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Pressure-Cooker-Recipe-Booklet_20181130_REFERENCE.pdfIf you are an older person with years of cooking experience, as I am, please read up and watch the videos, it is well worth it, because there is a bit of a learning curve.That said, this is an excellent product and I'm so happy to be learning newer and better ways to cook old favorites and discover new ones as well."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"It was actually my husband who insisted on buying an Instant Pot. I fought him on it for as long as I could, thinking that the last thing I needed was another appliance. This time, I have to admit that I was wrong. This machine has come to rescue quite a few times and I absolutely love it! The first time I cooked a beef roast in the Instant Pot, I was going out with some friends and wanted to make sure my husband and kids had food. Since I was rushing, I seasoned my roast with salt and pepper (nothing else), chopped a whole onion and put in a cup of beef broth. When I came back home, the first thing my son (who is a very picky eater) said was, ""Dinner was really good!"" This was a shock because everything he eats is ""okay."" My husband asked what I had done differently with the seasoning because the roast tasted like it had cooked for hours and it was amazing! When I told him how I prepared it, he said that it was impossible because it was more flavorful than any other that I've cooked. So, I no longer feel the need to season my beef roasts with a million different seasonings! If it's not broken, I'm not trying to fix it!I know I just raved about a beef roast, but I have cooked chicken, pork, baked potatoes, and soups in my Instant Pot and everything turns out perfect so I have recommended these to all of my friends--even those who think they don't need another kitchen appliance."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love it.The features of a larger appliance, small enough that I can cook for 2-4 or scale back for myself.  No boatload of leftovers to hassle with, just enough that I can cook a couple meals and alternate wirh a couple days of leftover lunches.  Max 3 quarts.  I make 1/2 an Instant pot of something, make a 1/2 an instant pot of something else the next and I’m done for the next 2-3 days.  I use it for oatmeal too.It’s got the Goldilocks “just right” thing going for it."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Works very well.  Unless you have a real reason to buy the bigger model stick with the mini as it is still pretty big and you'll save money.  If you use it for what it was meant for it should last a long time.  I bought it to pressure cook meat that way I can buy cheaper cuts.  Haven't experienced any of the things like those who posted neg responses and tbh some seem to be fishy. I dont see how the hard cover could melt and not the seal as its pretty sturdy. If you have prob with steam coming out of the nozzle, cover it with a cloth or wait for pressure to go down. Also disconnect it when not using it to extend the life of the pot and avoid electrical issues.  If you can buy it in a store do so as sometimes damages happen during delivery."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I was scared to ever try pressure cooking with the old-fashioned stove top type and was even pretty afraid of trying it the new electric style.  Turns out the new style is awesome!  Everything I've made in it so far was great and it was super easy to use and not at all risky or spooky.  It is pretty fast.  I do wish more recipes you see for it (especially like on the internet) did a better job of telling you the whole truth about how long they really take.  The pot takes a while to get up to full pressure (and some things need time to release the pressure slowly when the food is done), so you have to add that in to your cook time.  Too many recipes will say things like ""3 minute steel cut oats"".  But the truth is that you have to add in another 10 or 15 minutes for the pot to get up to pressure, then you have the 3 minutes of pressurized cooking, then you add in another 10 or 15 minutes for the pressure to release. Yeah, you hear about beans from dry to on the table in 20 minutes, but it's really beans start to finish in closer to 45 minutes to an hour. While it's still DRAMATICALLY faster and easier than the stovetop methods, it's not as lightning quick from fridge or pantry to table as many recipes make it sound.I used it last night to make chicken broth from the carcass of a baked whole chicken.  Wow was it fast!  Instead of the really really slow process that it usually is to cook broth on the stove (like it's not crazy to have it cooking basically all day), it was done (and really really done really richly) in about 2 hours total, from dropping the chicken into the pot and plugging it in to putting finished broth in the fridge.  And it didn't require the wasted energy of having a stove burning all day or the having to keep a bit of an eye on a running stove all day.I especially loved it for making potato soup, too.  It made soup from scratch fast enough to make it an easy convenient lunch meal.  No more canned soup for my house.  Fresh home made is quick and easy and delicious in the pressure cooker."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Instant Pot DUO Plus 60, 6 Qt 9-in-1 Multi- Use Programmable Pressure Cooker, Slow Cooker, Rice Cooker,  I have never cooked rice this well.  I followed the instructions , pushed the RICE button and walked away.  When finished it was perfect for me, not clumped up or overly sticky. Veg Beef Stew easy as can be with this pot.  Saute works great, brown meat quickly, then cover and steam to tender perfection.  I love it"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love this pressure cooker! I debated giving it four stars instead of five because there are some things I wish were different on it (like how much you can fill it and some easier more family friendly recipes in the recipe book) but in all honesty it's been nothing but good to me in producing amazing meals and tender meat!Something I wish someone had explained to me so I'll put it in my review:So many recipes call for huge amounts of meat (3-4lb) but my family is small so we only need 1-2lbs so I assumed less time is needed for the pressure cooker (I use the manual setting the most) but turns out meat will come out tender after cooking for LONGER. The heat cooks the meat quickly then the pressurized heat helps break down the tendons between the muscle of the meat making it ""fall off the bone"" tender. So if a recipe says cook a 4lb roast for 80-90 min and you get a smaller cut or meat, stick to the same time and you won't be sorry!"
4.0 out of 5 stars,"Gifted to someone because I have one and really enjoyed it - even though they can have some quirks which deducted one star.They can be finicky when it comes to the pressure valves. I had to manually manipulate mine because the steam would not build. I stuck a knife into the smaller stem and wiggled it until it sealed. Then the main pressure valve would leak steam so I moved it ever so slightly until it stopped leaking. It was able to get it sealed, but was definitely not ""Set it and forget it."" I've had others receive a new lid from the company but it was not something that was simple. They had to provide photos, speak with customer service more than once. I mention this because before I even got mine, I read the same issues with several people and think that Instant Pot should just own that there are issues which come up from time to time. Don't make people jump through hoops - it's not a replacement lid comes with a free, real diamond ring for the customer. I will update if I have more issues, but I'm hoping this doesn't disqualify me from getting my free diamond ring if I need one."
1.0 out of 5 stars,"This cooker is not turning on after five or six uses.  I thought it will be durable for the money paid.I saw the same complaint on many other reviewers.Anyone planning to buy this product, please check the negative reviews which are really true.I usually never review or comment but had to because of the disappointment."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Let me sum up my short time from receiving this to loving it.1. Feijoada in an hour with all the flavor of a 4+ hour feijoada.2. Spaghetti in one appliance (brown meat on saute, dump water, bolognese and pasta in and leave it for 15 minutes) when I was too tired to cook properly after work.3. Midnight queso with a hard-to-melt cheese in 10 minutes.This thing is a serious must have and it has answered every challenge I've thrown at it with speed and bravado. This product has enough safety features that I have absolutely no qualms about leaving the room while it's working. The steam release is quite ""angry"" so be prepared for that, but it's very hard to actually shoot yourself with the steam so that's a big plus. This product has an absolute wealth of features, some of which (I'm looking at you yogurt) I haven't used yet, but I've even managed to do a pork roast in this and have it come out pretty well.Now, I know some of you are rolling your eyes at the thought of some of the recipes you've seen, like the above-mentioned dump-spaghetti, but they've seriously impressed me. You'd think that cooking spaghetti that way would be terrible with inconsistently cooked spaghetti, waxy flavor and overcooked beef-- but it actually comes out very well. The flavors are married when you do it this way, so think of it like a baked pasta dish (and yes, adding cheese into it is f***ing amazing).Overall this is a must have for any kitchen, and a mandatory buy for a small kitchen."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love food cooked in earthen pots, as it keeps the food warm, not hot. The food tastes much better, for a number of reasons. One of the criteria is use to check if the food is cooked healthy is by checking the time taken for the cooked food to start decaying. Anything cooked in earthen pot stays fresh a bit longer, than food cooked in metal containers. Why do I bring this up in this review. Well, this thing cooks food almost as is it were cooked in an earthen pot.I have lived my life cooking rice in pressure cookers and why I dot like the texture, it's convenient and it's fast. The down side of it, is the rice gets compacted. Rice when cooked shouldn't stick to each other, as if it's glued together. When you take rice out of s pressure cooker, you only get baked cakes.This thing cooks rice almost to perfection. Wonder what the magic is.I have been using this for the last 3 months and I can't be more happier than this.I haven't used this to cook Dhal, but I'm assuming it will be good as well"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"There are so many things to make in the Instant-Pot. I have absolutely no idea how I have made it this long without having this in my life. Those things that are made ""low and slow"" can be done in less than half the time?? To sell my husband on it, I compared it to flying somewhere as opposed to driving. I love making rice in it too. We have an electric stove and it is next to impossible to cook rice on a burner without it sticking or coming out mushy. But the Instant-Pot makes it perfect EVERY SINGLE TIME. I made a whole chicken in a little over an hour and it was FALLING OFF THE BONE. One thing to note: it takes about 15 minutes to heat up before the timer starts and then 10-15 minutes of Natural Pressure Release. As long as you factor that extra time into your cook-time, you can make almost anything in less than an hour!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,I’m not sure how I cooked without it.  I just ate sirloin and make really tasty beef dishes and cook in fraction what f the time. So tender
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This Instant pot surprised me. It’s my third pot as I already own an 8qt Duo & 6qt Ultra.I probably use this one the most. especially for oatmeal in the mornings, but I can cook a whole bag of beans in it, a whole chicken, and its perfect for my brown rice. I have to say that I'm impressed."
3.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased this for my daughter for x-mas. I came delivered to me in just a plastic bag which I thought was odd, but OK. My daughter just went to use it for the first time and is does not work, it looks like the cover is cracked and It will not hold the pressure. It has passed the return date, so I guess I will need to buy a new one, and check to make sure it works right away. very disapointing!4-12-2018: I want to be clear about this item, It turns out it was a used product which I was not aware of, but after speaking with an Amazon representative they are going to refund my money. Amazon has always done the right thing for me I have nothing but great words about them. Love, love ,love them"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm in love. Life is easier. Since it's so fast compared to a slow cooker I wonder if I should have bought the smaller model, but I've had it a few months now and actually think that since I jar up a lot of my soups, etc. I prefer to have the larger model. It is quite big, though. It requires a certain minimum amount of liquid, I can't recall what it is, but some recipes you'll find will list less water so you're going to have to adjust recipes by doubling or figuring out if you can just add more, otherwise it won't actually get the pressure high enough. I do end up doing the meat and veggies separately because it will overcook the veggies. Depends on what you're doing and what you're preference is."
5.0 out of 5 stars,This air fryer lid is a wonderful addition to my 6 at instant pot. I've used it twice to make broiled steak and hot wings. This works just as well as my 8 at Instant Pot DuoCrisp
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Tonight was my first trial of the new Mini Instant Pot.  This is the second one I have and is well on its way to be my favorite.  Cooking for two, I seldom need the higher capacity of the larger models and haven't pressed to see how small a quantity I could cook without issues.  Tonight was my personal mix or whole grain rices with a 1 cup rice quantity.  It came out well.  I will try half the quantity next time to better match the needed quantity.I cook at sea level and also at 6000 feet in the mountains.  The Instant Pot does pressure cooking by temperature, so I can use the same recipe at either altitude.  This new Mini will relieve me from carrying my one pot from one altitude to another.From my standpoint, this is pressure cooking as it should have been.  No fussing with the burner flame and when there is steam enough ... just pick a cooking time and match it with the right liquid level for reproducible results.  I do less slow cooking because we like the that approach less, but again, it runs without constant attention."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"We've always been in the market for an air fryer, but we were always concerned about adding yet ANOTHER kitchen gadget to take up space on the counter. Luckily InstantPot came out with this nifty little gadget(P.S. It's not little, I'd say almost the same height as the 6qt InstantPot without the lid) and we KNEW we had to get it right away! We were super impressed at how it performs, a whole batch of fries done in 8min?! PERFECT."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Is there any reason for me to even leave my reasons? You've probably read a million reviews already and have at least one friend who just won't stop talking about it. When I bought the IP it replaced my slow cooker, rice cooker, and stovetop pressure cooker.DO: Buy the thingDON'T: Leave it in the box for months because you are afraid of it.DO: Find the Facebook IP group, download the IP recipe app, and if you want to really take it further find the freezer meal IP boot camps and get 30 meals prepared and frozen so all you have to do is pop them into the IP and in about 30-45 you have a hot, delicious dinner. I love having the freezer meals not only for my family, I still cook in between when I feel like it, but when others need a meal I have something ready to go.You'll find you'll want more than one, and, really I'm not just justifying myself, when you have a meal cooking but need a side of vegetables or something like or rice or pasta you'll want to have another one. I am looking at the 3 qt now for sides. I have even thought of getting one a 3 qt. for my parents, who are elderly, so they can have freezer meals prepped ahead of time and all they have to do it pop it in the IP."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've been using pressure cookers for as long as I can remember.  I'm finally letting my old (20 year) one go, and moving to something electric.  Not really going to miss the hissing jingle of the old one.I have only had this item for a few days, so if anything changes over time, I will update.  As of today, it is a 5-star review.  I purchased another, less known, brand from a BIG store.  It was on sale for $39 and I thought it might be a good deal.  I was mistaken.  Right out of the gate, I had trouble getting that one to seal, and I had trouble with the buttons and total lack of documentation.  I returned it.  Then I ordered this one.  In the first 5 minutes, I knew this was  far better.  Solid build, tight lock.  The pot is stainless steel instead of a nonstick pot like the others.Day 1, I cooked 9 chicken breasts.  Wanted to make chicken salad for me and plain chicken to feed my dog at dinner, so I did not want it browned.  I used the programmed button, but was skeptical because I thought the cycle was too short.  As it turns out, the heat-up process was about 15 mins (which does not count in the cycle time).  My chicken ended up being suitable for shredding.  Not bad, but in the future I will lessen the time to get it a little more firm.Day 2, Pork Ribs.  Ran a high pressure, 20 minute cycle.  Fall-Off-The-Bone done.  I cooked them naked, then brushed them with BBQ sauce, and did a quick (5-min) sear on the grill to brown the sauce.  That's the pic I attached.Next up:  Yogurt.Great user guide and documentation.  I would recommend this product and this brand."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"It took me half a year to muster up the courage to use it. And now we're I live with this machine. So much that were considering getting a larger IP and we already have the accessories on hand! I don't usually cook due to confusion with timing, heat, constant monitoring the stove but this instant pot gives me freedom to just leave it alone and come back to a nice meal! I'm pretty sure I can survive with out a stove/oven with just an instant pot for real"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have used this to cook rice, pasta, make soup and many other dishes. But I use it every day to cook my veggies.Put some water in the pot, veggies in the strainer basket, steam for 5 min, delicious veggies.When I was a child my parents had a pressure cooker. It was hard to use and dangerous. I was not allowed in the kitchen when they used it.The instant pot is very easy to use. It seams well constructed and the safety features mean you can not open it until the pressure has been released.I really use it almost every day."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Just bought a 3 qt instant pot and I can’t live without it. Fast, efficient and healthy! I had read an article by a personal trainer not employed by Instant Pot. She was so impressed she invites her clients to a demo and dinner. There is a learning curve so I needed to read the directions carefully and proceed carefully. Once I did that I was hooked. There’s lots of recipes and direction on line and Facebook support groups. I’m a one-person household so I bought a mini. That is my only regret. I like to have enough for a few meals not just one and a 6 qt would have been better. I had bought a pressure cooker a couple of years ago and never used it. I found the directions daunting. Instant Pot makes it simple and replaces other appliances like a Ricer, steamer and slow cooker. I put Instant Pot along side the invention of the safety pin."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"If you don't have an Instant Pot you need to get one!! This pot was a Black Friday purchase at a great price.  I have been using at least 3 times a week ever since it arrived.  We both love how easy it is to use and adapt our favorite recipes with the help of online videos and recipes.  Item arrived on time and as described.  Came with a simple guide with cooking times and an instruction booklet, but go online to watch videos for ideas on using it and recipes.  Instant Pot also has a great website and will help you learn how to use their wonderful product.  I highly recommend this Instant Pot Duo.  Easy to use and lots of recipe ideas out there in the Instant Pot communities on a variety of social media."
4.0 out of 5 stars,I have a full sized air fryer but when I saw this for my IP I had to try it....well it works great!  I have not tried all the features yet but am ready to try.  I airfried some frech fries for my first try and it took about 20 min with a shake 1/2 way through just like my lager air fryer.  It is a bit of a challenge to shake but not impossible by any means.  Can't wait to toss a whole chicken in there to bake then broil to crisp up
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love it! I'm so glad they make a 3 qt. The 6 is too big for two people with small appetites. I can cook a large chicken breast perfectly in 8 minutes.""Baked"" potatoes in minutes. Chicken salsa verde in 25 minutes shredded perfectly to wrap in tortillas."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"2 years later (11/15/19): I still absolutely love my instant pot. I will say, I wish I had bought the 8 qt to start with. (I have an 8 qt now) IP recommends the 6 qt for families up to 6 people, but my family of 5, which includes 2 high school age boys, needs a bit more, especially since my husband likes to take leftovers to work. You can find an IP recipe for pretty much anything online. Our family favorites so far have been turkey chili and pork carnitas. And there are numerous variations available for both of those. I looked at several turkey chili recipes to make my own. My family loves it! My kids devour boiled eggs whenever I make them. Looking forward to learning more ways to use both IPs. I do suggest adding a non-stick inner pot. I haven’t bought myself one yet, but anything that says to brown your meat on the sauté setting, like ground turkey, I’ve started doing it in a pan on the stove. Everything sticks to the stainless pot. Meatballs were especially difficult because of this.Initial review: I bought this specifically because I have been reading about how great it was for hard boiled eggs, so I haven’t used it for anything else, yet.As for the eggs...perfect! Perfect peel, perfect yoke, perfect white. This alone is worth the price.Can’t wait to try out the other functions on this thing."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This little appliance is just next level! I heard about Instant Pot, got curious and got the small (3 qt) one to try. The 3 qt makes meals for one to two persons. I saw some videos on use and recipes. Most tout taste and time and they are right! I have made one delicious dish after another easily and in less time than other food cooking methods. I'm now using the Instant Pot for almost all my one pot meals. FYI, I made an unbelievable pasta sauce bursting with flavor - but I don't like putting spaghetti noodles in with it. Call me old fashioned but I like to boil the noodles - I get a cleaner taste because I get to strain the noodles.  One thing I'm not crazy about is the clean-up. The silicone seal in the lid keeps the odor of the last meal cooked despite mega scrubbing attempts. Saw one vid where the lady bought extra silicone seals and swapped them out when cooking similar meals. Good idea. Still my new favorite way to make meals."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased the air fryer lid to not buy a separate air fryer, and to not turn on the oven to finish off food after it finishes cooking in the instantpot. I like certain things crispy so I found myself not using the instant pot.I didn't realize I have the Duo SV 60-which IS NOT compatible with this lid. BUT! It still works! I DO NOT RECOMMEND IT. for me, the lid sits on top of the instant pot, it does NOT seal shut. Have used and only plan to use the Air Fry and Broil buttons. Ive cooked chicken wings and drumsticks in the pot then crisped up, as well as french fries (fresh and frozen) using it soley has an air fryer and I love it. Now I dont have to turn on oven and am getting a lot more use out the instantpot.Just why wouldn't they make it compatible with ALL machines is ridiculous"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I totally, totally love mine and plan to buy a few as gifts. I have a few pressure cookers and would give them all up but for my pressure canner to for this instant pot. I wish I could give it more than 5 stars. I have used most of the setting and have found it easy to use, the sky is the limit. So far I have made a roast with potatoes and carrots, ham and bean soup, bacon and bean soup, mash potatoes, old fashion rice, rotisserie chicken, Chicken Fettuccini Alfredo just to name a few turns out amazing cooked at the same time in one pot. I even cooked meat and used the fast release to add the vegetables later. Everything turned out amazing. Great to be able to cook it all at once which means less clean up. I love how it holds things warm, little or no steam coming out and almost no noise but for when it starts up. You get all the things you love with a pressure cook with none of the things you don’t like plus so much more.I told my son they needed one, he said I don’t like food cooked in a slow cooker, I told him this is nothing like that. They were coming over this weekend so I told them to let me make a rotisserie chicke, give it a try and see what you think. I waited until they got here and showed them from start to finish how easy it was, they totally fell in love with it. I will be buying them one this week. They will get so much enjoyment out of it with good tasting healthy food.Let’s face it everyone is looking for healthier ways of cooking that cuts your time in half, for my family this is the way to go. I love that everything is stainless steel, easy to use, very little mess and is so quite it is a shame not to have one. I got the 8qt for me and will be getting the 6 qt for my son and another one for a friend. I am also checking into getting another pan for the inside so I can go from making one things to another without washing it why it is hot. There are also some Accessories I want.It is made of good quality and will last for years. I may even buy another one for myself. I can’t see me every going back to a pressure cooker and do not want to be without one."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"We've had an Instant Pot for over a year. I was unfamiliar with air fryers until recently. I didn't want another appliance so I purchased this air fryer lid to go with the Instant Pot. So far, it's been amazing. We use it 1-2 times per day most days. So far I've only used the Air Fryer setting but I like the variety of settings it offers. Ideally, it would be nice to have an air fryer that had a little larger capacity, but being this lid/basket is compatible with the size of my Instant Pot, that's no fault of this product at all."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"My fault!  I got this pressure cooker and put it to good use, cooking the dogs meal, my husbands meal and also let some dough rise. At the end of the day I cleaned it (to put away) and since I have not much counter space I decided to store it on top of the stove which was not used all day and cold. Guess what, when I put it on there, it must have moved the darn dial on the back of the stove and it melted away slowly :(  My husband (bless him) said I know you loved that pot, go order you an other one (big deal for us, we have no money to spare), which I did :)  I cleared a corner for this baby with no cabinets on top and LOTS of space around it. Why I am writing this? Well I read the warning booklet and did not think twice about it to put it on an unused stove and it HAPPENED.  Do NEVER ever put it near a heat source or stove. My new pot came and I am back in bliss. Will try to save up money to get me the smaller one as well.PS: Yes, the rubber seal starts getting the smell of what ever food you cook. I just put it on sterilize and the smell went away."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have more that a dozen restored WWII vintage pressure cookers. I came kicking and screaming to this purchase. Having vowed never to own one, I was thrown into a living space with no stove/oven, which demanded I seek an alternative. Enter the IP Duo. After seeing more than 100K reviews and a 4.5 rating...I took a chance. After passing the water test and cooking potatoes as a first meal, I have not looked back. Even Google helps with meal prep suggesting various recipes at the first click.  I have enjoyed its ease of use and even its burn warnings which have actually saved a meal from being burned (twice),  YouTube is a wonderland experience for IP owners.  Pick a cuisine and IP has already been there. Yes, I am happy with my purchase. No I don't have a second one...yet,"
3.0 out of 5 stars,"So this thing works as advertised. But I question how good a deal it is compared to just getting an air fryer. My thinking when I got it was save a little money and more importantly, save a little space over getting another kitchen appliance.But the thing is It’s not much cheaper and it doesn’t save much space, and the space in the air fryer itself is not a lot.  You just simply can’t cook much food in the IP by the time you get the basket in there. And because the food is stacked inside a pot, instead of just placed on racks, it’s a pain to use.  And it’s loud.I used my parents dedicated air fryer several times on a recent visit to their place and it was easier to use, held a lot more food at once, and was quieter.If I had to do it again, I’d skip this and just get an air fryer."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I first made teriyaki chicken with vegetables and it was easy and delicious. The chicken was very tender. The next day I made beef enchiladas using stew beef chunks. After cooking, the sauté feature reduced the liquid much faster than my gas stove ever did. The enchiladas were amazingly good with a strong beef flavor combined with the enchilada sauce flavor. I've struggled with tough meat before, but the 20 minutes with the 3lbs of chicken and the 30 minutes with the 2.5lbs of stew beef resulted in perfectly tender meat. Cooking bone broth for 3 hours resulted in a very gelatinous broth (slow cooker takes many more hours).The heating element and thick bottomed inner pan design provides perfectly even heat. The controls are very easy to use, but I suggest reading the first few pages of the manual to get a good idea of all the features. The way that it heats up to the selected pressure, keeps it there with very little steam escaping, and shuts off after the programmed time, produces great results every time. You can barely smell what it is cooking - I don't smell the food in the house the next day as a slow cooker can do. And I believe the claimed energy savings since it doesn't radiate much heat.It is hard to cook great meals after coming home from work, but this has made it much easier and less error prone. And I love to hear my kids ask for seconds. It has exceeded my high expectations, even after I read all the other positive reviews."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love that i could saute or brown meat without changing pans or pots. I mostly use saute, meat, pressure, slow cook and manual setting. During pressure, the cover sturdily locks the whole pot and does not let you open it if there is still pressure. It has a pleasant sound when you lock it. All the recipe i tried for instapot were simply delicious, cook book not included. I dislike the part when i have to let the pressure out bec the steam moistens the area around it with droplets of broth or soup. Probably because i tend to overfill. It is easy to clean the steel pot. A little hassle to clean the cover, rubber ring and the sides of the pot being too narrow.  It is big enough to feed a party."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Not sure where I have been, or why i haven't heard of this pot long before now.  Great quality, stainless steel pot. At first I was a little intimidated because of horror stories of the old time pressure cookers that exploded, or caused bad burns.  This pot has over 10 safety features in place.. if you don't put the lid on right, it wont build steam.  if the pot has pressure in it, the lid can't be opened until all pressure is released.  I LOVE this pot!. early christmas gift and already cooked a rack of ribs in 30 minutes that fell off the bone, and tried a beef strogganoff  tonight that was delish!. was concerned noodles might not cook well, but they were perfect.I didnt need a pan to cook the meat, and a pan for the pasta, and a strainer for the noodles, NOPE!!!  all cooked in the same pot. pot has a saute button to brown  meats or saute veg.,  biggest con is having to figure out how much water for each type of  product your cooking and amount you are cooking and how much time.  just go online and type in instant pot recipes and you will get thousands to try. With time I'm sure it will become second nature.  haven't tried this yet, but you can cook a whole chicken that is frozen in about an hour!  thats amazing.  Can't even imagine how this could help working moms who come home and have dinner to cook. Saves time and money because instead of cooking the ribs in the oven several hours, it was done in 30 min., also will save extra money when I'm not heating up the house with the stove on, while the air conditioning is running.  It is also a crock pot, and has delay start function. Recommend checking out review questions as it answers a lot of normal questions, and check out some of the recipes on line to see how simple they can be.  Highly recommend"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I now understand the hype about electric pressure cookers. This thing really makes life easier. So far I’ve made Korean bulgogi, sauerkraut, chicken cacciatore, rice, and mashed cauliflower and each dish has been so easy and fast. I was a bit afraid to use it st first (the pressure freaked me out), but I followed the instructions to test it with some water first. That helped me feel less nervous.  I’m sure if you’re looked into Instant Pots, you know everyone raves about theirs. I’m in the bandwagon and may retire my crockpot (which to be honestly is very old and doesn’t have the digital features making new ones particularly nice). I later also purchased the glass top for sautéing, which I wish I just came with since it’s necessary for many dishes."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I nabbed one of these bad boys on sale and it arrived quickly, efficiently packaged, and in working order. I made three dishes in it, details below. TLDR at bottom.The same day that it arrived, I went grocery shopping and saw a 13# turkey on sale for $0.50/lb. I had to grab one and decided to test my new Instant Pot. I have never cooked my own turkey before but figured for $7, I was willing to try. Since the turkey was too big for the 8qt Instant Pot (according to the manual you want food to fit below a certain line), I cut off the poor bird's legs and stuffed it in the pot along with some water mixed with spices and powdered stock. The Instant Pot took maybe 40 minutes to pressurize and then cooked for my manual request of 60 minutes on high pressure. I checked the internal temp on the bird before removing and it was good to go. Folks, the meat was already falling off the bones, it was so tender. I decided to take the whole pot and dump it into a strainer resting over a larger bowl (to catch all the juices) and transferred the turkey to a pan to rest.Next, I took some fingerling potatoes cut in halves along with about a cup of the saved juices and roughly followed the small roast potatoes recipe from the recipe book that was included. This also used to pressure cooker function, which I noticed took less time to pressurize this time (probably because it wasn't so stuffed). These potatoes came out perfectly cooked (and delicious) in about 30 minutes from start to finish, including prep.Last, I decide to use the Saute function to make some gravy. The pot heats pretty quickly for this function, even if you haven't already been cooking. I used the remaining juices from the turkey, added flour,and whisked on high until incorporated, then turned back down to low to simmer. Bam - delicious gravy.TLDR: I made a delicious Thanksgiving dinner in under 3 hours from start to finish on my first ever attempt AND with an unfamiliar appliance. I'm sold and can't wait to use it again."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"My mama found herself needing this after a funeral when somehow she wound up hosting several guests from the funeral for lunch. She had no meat defrosted and had little time to spare. She had not used the instant pot before and she is not a spring chicken nor tech savvy at all. Further, either the directions did not come in the box or she had taken them out when she inspected it (it was my Christmas gift to her) a few months ago and they got thrown away. At any rate, she did not have any directions whatsoever. But between my dad and she, they were able to cook a frozen (whole) turkey in minutes (and were able to figure out how to use it easily without killing themselves). This is a miracle machine! They were amazed how brilliantly the turkey turned out--cooked perfectly!"
1.0 out of 5 stars,"Love this item however after just one month of having it the fryer basket chipped. I made sure to avoid spraying and cooking sprays on the basket (had heard Pam spray especially was not advised for it, so never used that) so not sure how that happened. Now trying to see if I could get a replacement basket.Other than that issue we loved I’m having the air fryer attachment. Saves on counter space to have an air pressure and air fryer in one. I would recommend going larger than the 6qt for more than person though. But that’s more likely an Instant Pot issue."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm sure there are a gazillion reviews on this so I'm just going to say that I am not someone that likes to cook AT ALL but I have a family and I don't want to spend money eating out or buying prepared foods all the time. This has made life a lot easier because you can cook things up in about 30 minutes that would normally take hours in the oven or all day in the crock pot. Not that I don't love my crock pot (and of course this can be used as one too) but unless you plan ahead you can't use it, and I usually fly by the seat of my pants when it comes to dinner. This cooks up everything beautifully, I use it just about every day. I do think it helps if you get a good cook book to go with it, or there are tons of recipes on Instagram and YouTube that you can find. Worth it!!!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"AmazingPot they should call it. First recipe was Chicken and Wild Rice Soup. Very hearty. Get ready to spend on accessories: I like a second liner pot ($35) the glass lid for sautéing, a better base riser than it came with, as well as a stainless steamer basket. Also find that a silicone steamer with ""feet"" and ""handles"" is nice as you can use that to lift things out--such as cheesecake. Yup. You'll want the 7"" dia  x 3"" high pan for that!You can set up the delay feature for foods like steel cut oats the night before--it cooks breakfast while we get ready. You'll need to get stainless or heatproof bowls though as this requires the ""pot in pot"" technique which saves on cleanup too.You may never need your stove again except to finish certain recipes under the broiler. I also notice so many men seem to love it--the book by two guys with 500 recipes is worth getting too.Yes you're in for $200 or more with all the extras--but you'd spend that on a session with a psychotherapist and this will change your life much more quickly. (Yes I am one; I know whereof I speak!).I've given these as gifts a few times lately and other friends have joined the frenzy. We're planning an Instant Pot Challenge at the lake this summer!"

For those of you trying to make air fried meals or roasted meat or reheat something without microwave irrigation....get u one sis. One hang up is the ceramic pot is so narrow and you can fit that much food also it ONLY works with one instapot brand so cooking for a lot of folks would take some time. Also that little metal disk that it comes with doesn't stay sturdy. However it's cool I usually use the instapot stainless steel pot n.e ways."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"I love this fryer.  No muss, no fuss.  Push some buttons, and let it go.  I don't love the accessories that came with it.  The fryer basket started to flake off it's coating after about 10 uses.  And the little thin divider that you're supposed to use as a separator for larger jobs just sucks.  There is no way to take it and the food on top of it out of the fryer without risking serious burns, or dumping the food.  I had to design a tool to lift it out evenly and safely, and that only works so-so."

The ip duo mini is perfect for eggs, pasta etc.....I do roasts, soups like ham n beans, pea soup and chili in the 6qt...using fresh dried lentils and beans!  I love it!  It’s just me but I cook Sunday dinner after church for my 22 yr old Son.  I also share with my neighbors.  Cheese cake is in my future when I get the right pan.I tell everyone about the instapot...I’m late to the party but a huge fan.  My hands are crippled from rheumatoid and using and oven is not possible.  Thanks to instapot I can still cook, and really healthy stuff. Hit me up if you have any questions.Previous returnedThe condensation collector is too big. I believe it is for a bigger or not the duo mini. Can’t see using it with condensation running into the base. Also received with no instruction booklet or any paper work for that matter, Returning. Ordering another in its place because I want it.

3.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my second Instant Pot. Unfortunately, these newer models have a feature called ""Food Burn"". If the Instand Pot detects burnt food at the bottom of the pot, it will stop cooking and flash that dreaded ""Food burn"" warning. My old Instant Pot never had this problem, but the new one throws up this warning almost every time I cook. This renders the IP useless. The solution to Food burn? you have to pour the uncooked food into another container, clean the inside pot, scrub the burnt gunk off the bottom, pour the food back in, add more water, check the silicone ring, THEN start over. The whole point of an IP is so you don't have to think about the food. These new models are disappointing."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased the older model without the yogurt setting and was disappointed so I gave that one to my daughter and purchased this one to replace it. I use it constantly! Beans, rice, soups but mostly yogurt! I am vegan and vegan yogurt is very expensive. With this I can make my own. It's fresher and is as easy as pie. I just set it up and forget it. I have made yogurt in my dehydrator before and while that works this is SO much better. Now that I have my several batches, I am using the previous batch to make the next and the flavor just keeps getting better and better, tangy and delicious! Making chilies or soups with beans just requires a plan in the morning (I like to soak the beans a bit). I love the versatility of this device, far better and more flexible than a crock pot. You can saute your onions, garlic, whatever, add the rest of your ingredients set it and in less than 30 minutes you are sitting down to a hot meal. Such a great item for us procrastinators!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've owned the Instapot for more than a year now and use it on a weekly basis. I love this thing and have recommended it to many friends now. I use the pressure cook and slow cook options regularly! I even got rid of my stovetop pressure cooker, because I wasn't using it anymore. This one does the job perfectly well, with no noise, and no mess. I use the pressure cook function to make flan, meat, and beans. The slow cooker is fantastic for busy working families especially. No one feels like cooking when we get home from work, so I prep meals the night before, toss the in the Instapot in the morning before going to work, and leave it slow cooking throughout the day. The timer is great, because I can customize cooking times exactly how I want them. The saute feature is a huge bonus. A lot of slow cooker recipes require that you brown the meat first. It really saves the mess and hassle of browning it on the stove, and then transferring it over to the slow cooker. I simply use the saute feature to brown whatever I need, then turn it off, switch to slow cook mode, cover, and walk away. It's the best feeling to get home from work in the evening and have a home cooked meal ready to go!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought it because it was on sale and thought I would use it sometime within the next 6 months. Just like my crock pot. (Which I haven’t used and it’s stored somewhere in my garage)  but my son got me to use it the 2nd day after I got it and I absolutely love it! I’ve made a pork loin with potatoes, a pot roast, chicken. And the meat melts in your mouth. I cooked some frozen ravioli on the egg setting with a bit of water and it cooked just right.  Only mistake I made was buying the 3 qt as opposed to the 6qt. This is a great buy and love how it cut down on cooking  time and the mess. You won’t be disappointed!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,Absolutely love this! So much that I just bought a second one! I use it several times a week. It Makes the best cheesecake! I have made yogurt many times and it always turns out. My other favorites are broccoli beef and shredded chicken.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I picked up an 8QT on black Friday for super check. Love it, but it's the basic model. I wanted to try yogurt so I decided to get the slightly smaller 6QT with that button. No regrats. I actually hate yogurt, so I've made it a handful of times, had a couple bites and then remembered I hate yogurt.Things I really like about my 6QT: it has WAY more buttons on than my 8QT. I still mostly just use the manual pressure cook button, but I like having the options open, just in case. It doesn't take nearly as long to ""pressure-up"" as my 8QT, so I can make stuff faster. I use it mostly for rice (side note, rinse that rice and cook it in the IP because it's a game changer). In fact, we threw our rice cooker out.Basically, if you are thinking about getting an IP, this is a good choice. It's smaller, but still big enough you could make food for a family of probably 6 easily. I know have two, plus my vortex and I'm trying to come up with a reason to talk my husband into a 3QT - just to round out the family."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Who doesn’t love the Instant Pot? Fine product. However, the crockpot part of the Instant Pot leaves something to be desired-the normal setting is too low-took 9 hours to cook a corned beef brisket and I felt that 4 lb brisket shouldn’t have taken that long! And, I never noticed the liquid (I added it Hot) simmering which gives me bacteria concerns and made me wish I hadn’t donated my crockpot to charity. Pressure cookers have been around all of my life and this one is extremely easy to use. The overall size of the InstantPot is a something the average homeowner needs to plan for-it is Not small and the average kitchen cabinet won’t hold it. I cleared a place in the pantry for it and that solved that problem! Would I purchase one again? Probably not but like I said, I have been around pressure cookers all of my life and own cookers from very small to large canning sizes."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"In truth, it's really an ""Eventually Pot"". I made a pea/mushroom risotto with a strip of cut-up bacon for my maiden voyage.Here's how the instant pot works: you saute the things which need to be sauted (mushrooms, onions,) in it in its saute mode. Then you turn it on. And then--for first timers--- you scour the internet and the books to see why it's not working. After about 15 minutes it starts to hiss and finally you see that the 6 minute cooking time is on.After 6 minutes you have a choice: you can let it sit until the steam has died away and then open and eat (Natural Pressure Release) .  OR you can release the steam and it will hiss and jet up to the ceiling (this is where you are thankful you did not put it under your wooden counters). Then when it's finished its long hissy fit, it gives you the go ahead to open the pot and serve.So---next time I will relax and not bite my nails while I'm waiting for it to do its thing.Next time I will start earlier and let the steam dissipate all by itself--Natural release.The Eventually Pot is a good idea for combining soups and cassaroles and things like that. Once you are used to its ways and realize that the 6minute cooking time includes about 30-45 minutes of girding its loins and ungirding its loins, I see that it can do a good job.  If I had not been a Nervous Nellie I would have sat down with a book and relaxed.  That's what I'll do next time, which will probably be tomorrow.The risotto? Very good; not mushy. Cooked perfectly. Perfect consistency.  The actual amount of time I took stirring the risotto was a tiny fraction of the time I have took making the risotto in the traditional way."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"The best small appliance in my kitchen by far, the most widely used and most versatile. Solid, well made, reliable, saves time what’s not to like about this magic pot. I have been using the Instant Pot for well over a year now and it has never given me poor result. Everything I cooked in it turns out moist, tender and delicious. Maintenance on the inner Stainless Steel pot is easy and simple. After it cools down, I just hand wash it along with some of my dishes. Most food and stains comes right off. For tougher stains I wipe it clean it with  a little vinegar. This was probably my all time Best Buy on Amazon. This was my third purchase as I give them to family as presents and I will continue to do so."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"One, I got this through a warehouse deal. You always roll the dice a bit with that, but we got a new one (if there are quality differentials listed get the best one).So, we have a history of buying the latest greatest stuff using it once or twice and then it sits until we have a garage sale or we take give it away. Not an instant pot. This is a valuable device. It really works and if you are making soup from dry beans, nothing beats it. This pretty much applies to virtually all things made with slow cookers where you put the recipe together and then put it in the pot and wait overnight for it to cook. Nope, you are eating in an hour or so with these and it is good. I must admit, with all things, sometimes its better on day two after the flavors sit and mix but that is true with any cooking where the melange of flavors take time to fully come to the fore.But since we are Americans and instant gratification is an important part of our culture, this is a functional high quality kitchen tool you will like while enjoying its outputs quickly.  Following the recipes out there will get you started, but as every cook knows, learn from each experience to improve your flavors and that has nothing to do with the Instant Pot. That's on you.Biggest issue with these is the sealer ring at the top. And this is not really an issue. They pick up the flavor/smell of the most recent potful. I stick it in the dishwasher and that takes care of it. Don't know if that will impact its life, but you can get the rings pretty inexpensively online and you might want to get some soon after buying. You would hate to have it break or not work right when you really need that ring and don't have one.  The seven P's. Proper Prior Planning Prevents Poor Performance.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love the size, which is the reason I bought it. However, In the past,  I would never have cooked with this small a pot. Now a single and living without a bunch of people, I've gone small. Wow. is that taking some getting use too. I still tend to be shocked at how little this pot holds, but I'll get use to it, in time. Still am loving it.It works great. At my age, and eye sight, when I see the button for vent or seal, I ask myself, which way to go - forward or back? Once I did it wrong and split pea soup bubbled out of everywhere. So, I'm learning. Next I'll have to get rid of a big freezer and just keep the small one. What next?"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"My wife has been loving cooking in this since we got it, and has been very happy with it from day one. Small learning curve, but it didn't take long to replace the crock pot for almost everything. It cooks faster in general, you can still slow cook if you want, and it allows cooking things easily that were otherwise not worth the trouble (getting ribs tender with this was actually successful, a nice change for us).Only caveats are that for our family size, the 8 Qt might have been better. Even with fewer people, the bigger one can be handy for cooking larger amounts at times. But the price difference was significant at the time.One part failed early on and was replaced under warranty. Only other issue was when it was dropped on a trip, and got a noticeable dent in the side that separated it at the bottom. Didn't harm the pressure chamber at all, and I was able to take it apart and straighten it out enough to fit in the base properly again.Very happy with it, would be a top priority to replace if it every failed."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Never thought I'd own a pressure cooker because of the safety concerns but this is so easy to use. And the incredible community of support that comes with it makes finding recipes really easy. A lot of people question whether it actually saves time, before getting one, research the Instant Pot facebook community. that's what I did and it convinced me to buy this. It saves time on long cooking items, but for shorter cook times, it may not save actual duration of time but certainly saves on effort because I'm doing something else instead of standing by the stove. Love this product!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"So far so good.  I had an electric Cuisinart 6 Qt Pressure Cooker before and I loved it.  I purchased the Instant Pot when the Cuisinart went kaput.  The 6 Qt Cuisinart was about the perfect size for my needs - it made a lot of lunches for the week.  However, the 8 Qt Instant Pot was on sale so I purchased it.  It is a lot bigger than what I really need, but it has worked flawlessly so far.  I have made black beans and low carb chili, and it has worked perfectly.  I like that that silicone grommet is different in the Instant Pot than the Cuisinart; my Cuisinart was having troubles sealing and I had to change out the aluminum sealer and gasket - the Instant Pot only has the silicone gasket (which is easy to clean).  I also like how the Instant Pot seals tighter (IMO) than the Cuisinart (at the end I sometimes had to push down on the top to get it to seal for pressure cooking). I really liked my electric Cuisinart PC (which I had for over five year), but the Instant Pot feels better so far (especially considering the price point while on sale and how it seals - it just feels more secure than the Cuisinart).  It also seems like the Instant Pot has far more support with recipes and websites than the Cuisinart PC had (not that I didn't find it on the internet somewhere)."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"For someone who uses their instant pot regularly, this addition adds more bang for his buck. My previous air fryer died a while ago and I have been looking for a new one; when I found out I could get a separate attachment for an already existing appliance as opposed to buying a whole new one I was on board. Having use it about five times so far I’m very satisfied with the results; food comes out delicious and crispy."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Good pot for the price paid ($80). Don't need all the functions now but maybe later? Its a good way to get meals cooked but, I don't completely agree with not soaking lentils and beans... It's part of the ancient process for some foods to be prepared the way they are traditionally prepared. When we cooked lentils without soaking, the shells didn't break down and while it was cooked, texture wasn't there.6 quarts is enough for three people and three left over meals. I don't know how much you eat but, we are athletic and eat average sized meals.The pot takes four minutes to preheat before you actually get to pressure cooking, it will cook lentils in 3min but you have to build the pressure first.Great for rice dishes and stews. Sauté function is useful. Don't eat milk so yogurt function is not for me. And I live in the desert so fresh fruit is always available year round and I have no need to can items.Still trying to figure out the timing so that the meal doesn't come out like baby food when I include sweet potatoes.Need to buy the stacking clay pots.This model is good for the money if you keep it clean and running smooth. The rubber gasket is getting stained but if you wash it, it prevents  build up. I can see how the inner stainless steel pot might fail first after years of use. So far it's good.I would probably buy the more basic model to save some money next time. I don't need the extra functions.Im sure there are better pots out there but this works for us.Enjoy!"
2.0 out of 5 stars,"I gave into the Instant Pot craze and gave it a try. It didn't work for me. Most of the amazing recipe times don't include the time it takes for the unit to pressurize and depressurize. I hated that you can't check on or taste the food while it's cooking, which should have been a no-brainer but just wasn't something I realized was important to me until after I tried using this. Also, anything starchy (like potatoes or split-pea soup) makes it really hard to clean. I've had a multi-function rice cooker that I can also use as a slow cooker, oatmeal cooker, steamer, and even to saute, and with that I don't need an Instant Pot. My super rice cooker is fast enough for me and I can monitor my food throughout. If you're on the fence, maybe a non-pressurized multi-cooker would be enough for you too."
3.0 out of 5 stars,"If I were to rate the Instant Pot on the way it performed the first couple of times I used it, I would give it a 5. It made my life convenient. I could add things to it to steam for my baby and return in an hour to a meal for my kid.The instant pot however stopped working about 2 months in (I owned it for 6+ months, but started actively using only 2 months ago). It still works, but things are ALWAYS half cooked (in spite of adding extra water and extra cooking time). Just imagine, the risks! What if I had absent mindedly served half cooked meat to my baby.I contacted their customer service and they made a run through hoops - sending photos, explaining things again and again. The resolution: They sent me an email eventually stating that they will offer me a ""DISCOUNTED"" price of $63. I thought it was a joke since the product is available everywhere for $59.99. It almost seemed like spam to me. I have never experienced such terrible customer service.I should add that in spite of having sold a sub-par product to me, Amazon customer service was no help either.After 10+ days of dealing with the Instant Pot Custumer service team, I am stuck with a broken instant pot and complete distrust for Instant Pot as a brand. To conclude, when the instant pot works it works well, but when it stops working you will have to toss it.Buy this if you want to gamble with $59.99.UPDATE: Since writing this review, instant brands did send me a replacement instant pot mini. It arrived today."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have a friend that is constantly talking about how great a pressure cooking is, I was skeptical... I stand corrected, I love this thing... best kitchen gadget I have bought in years.The one function that got me to pull the trigger on this was the yogurt function, that was the first thing I made in it and have done a second batch since.. both turned out great.  A gallon of yogurt for the price of a gallon of milk... cant beat it. (This thing will pay for itself.)I can make an entire gallon of yogurt at one time with WAY less mess and hassle than the way I did it before.I am one of those folks that always tosses the veg and meat trimmings into the freezer, then once I cant fit anything else Ill break out the giant stock pot and make a large batch of stock and freeze it into bags.By the time all is said and done its a 24 hour process and there it a good deal of cleanup, since getting the pressure cooker I have simplified the process.... as soon as I have enough bits and pieces of veg and chicken or whatever.... to make a batch in the Ipot... in it all goes & 30 min on high pressure from frozen... and amazing stock, the much smaller batches make for much easier cleanup and the quality is soooo there.Made some of the best pork ragu ever in 30 min instead of 3 hours. When it comes to meats, depending on what you make its a one or 2 step process. Cheaper cuts cook to fork tender in a few min compared to the 3 hours it takes the collegian to break down when going low and slow. If you want browning most of the time its going to take some oven/broiler time, but honestly who cares.. I'm in.A couple of minor bad bits... you have to (like most pressure cookers) occasionally change the silicone seal... however good luck finding one. I did contact the manufacturer before buying this & they said they will be available again in about 6 weeks (from time of writing). Sometimes the pressure indicator sticks in the up position, but its not that big a deal. The unit should turn off after it scalds for the yogurt function rather than go to warm. I would of preferred an 8qt option rather than 6.. but its adequate.If you are one of those that whines about stainless over non-stick, keep moving, nothing to see here... there are other brands available, for the ease of browning in SS over NS, I dont mind a soak in the sink on the rare occasion it needs it.None of these things add up to much, the big tell for me is, would I buy it again? Absolutely! Just go ahead and pull the trigger on this one, you wont be sorry."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love my IP so much. I had a 5 quart Duo but wanted another one since many I know own several, even 4! So on cyber Monday I saw this 8 quart Duo Plus for such a sweet deal I snatched it up and so glad I did ! My first recipe in this one was a double recipe of fresh homemade Cranberry Sauce! So fast, easy and yummy! You can't go wrong with these wonderful pressure cookers! Don't be afraid. It's not your grandmothers old fashioned one. These have so many fail safes. One bit of advice is that if you are new to them and nervous and have Facebook then join the group on there called Instant Pot Community! So many members who are so helpful. I joined then for about 4 days read every post , gathered great information and then felt ready to use my IP and have been going strong since. I've seen one bad review on here and it makes me wonder why so critical and I don't believe the company ignored them. They always make things right and the people on the FB that ran into problems filed a ticket and things were made right so I wonder if the sour grape person works for another company, hmmm, lol, never know! As for me and millions other we love our IP's! Proud to be a pothead 😂I love making tender fall apart roasts in mine! Beans, rice, casseroles , you name it! Next up will be yogurts '!Enjoy cooking. As with anything there is a Learning curve. Study up quickly so you can avoid mistakes. I've never had a failure in mine. Nothing burned or sputtered because before hand I learned how to AVoid that! Go ahead. Buy one... or two... or more 🍚🤗"
3.0 out of 5 stars,It works great. Only complaint is it is not balanced. I have to put something under one side of it to balance it. Wasn’t worth trying to return for that.Sometimes I have to restart to get pressure to build. I can only use the manual button! Any preset button cause a good burn.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love this pot!  I use it almost everyday now to make food for my family of 5.  I can easily put all the ingredients into the pot and have things cooked in less than 1/2 hour.  On the weekend we can make bigger batches of meat/stew and it's awesome.Tip 1) do get the extra silicone ring as the meat smell stick to the coverTip 2) If you are planning to use this as a rice cooker, or thinking of using this to make several dishes for one night, consider buying the extra pot.  Right now with one pot, I have to empty out the stuff before cooking another dishWish list: if the inner pot can also be used on stove top, then it'll be awesome.  I use to sear the meat first before stewing.  There's a saute function, but I don't think it's hot enough or is heating up quick enough for a nice sear."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"I was a bit skeptical about jumping on the Instant Pot bandwagon, but after using the cooker for a few weeks, I am glad I did.  I prepared a beef stew in 1 and 1/2 hours from start to finish.  Black beans, made from dry beans, cooked in about 25 minutes, versus the 2 to 3 hours needed on a stove top.  Rice pudding took less than 20 minutes without having to constantly watch the pan.  Cheesecake was also done in under 1/2 hour and came out creamy and delicious. There is a learning curve with the device.  For example, if you use the pressure cooker feature, you will need only about 1/2 the amount of liquid that your recipe calls for.  There are plenty of websites and cookbooks available on pressure cooking (and for the Instant Pot specifically) where you can find tips on how to use the cooker successfully.."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is the greatest thing I have ever purchased! I use it all the time! You can do 2 dozen eggs in this thing in about 15-20 minutes using the 5-5-5 method (5 minutes pressure cook, 5 minutes slow release, 5 minutes ice bath). I made brown rice in this using the recipe it came with and it came out perfect! I've made pulled pork in way less time that it would take you normally, different chicken recipes and I have yet to try making cheesecake in it, but that is next on my list to try! Right now it is just me and my fiancé but the 6 qt is perfect because I always have extras for leftovers. I have not tried making yogurt with it but I have heard many have had success with it. There's just so many things you can make with this that you won't be disappointed!Also, do not let this thing intimidate you! Mine sat in a box for 3 months before I was brave enough to try it. It's actually not that hard, however I do prefer to follow recipes made for the instant pot because it's a lot easier than having to guess how long to cook something for. I've bought plenty of accessories for it as well.The only real con is don't plan on using this as a replacement for your crockpot. It just doesn't slow cook very well because only the bottom gets hot, as opposed to the bottom and sides of your crockpot. It can however, cook rice perfectly and saute, so you can get rid of your rice cooker.Overall, very satisfied with this purchase!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"You do not want to fire up a stove.  This kept me fed last year when we were in the middle of one of the worst heatwaves and my a/c died.  No way was I going to fire up a stove to cook dinner.  After the big roof top a/c unit was replaced I still wasn't going to fire up the stove.  That 'energy efficient"" a/c unit is still an electricity hog.  The Instant Pot is kinder to the utility bill.It's other function is to feed my 17 year old Miniature Pinscher.  I make his food in this pot, hit it with a stick blender and he gets healthy dog food (yes, he gets a vitamin and mineral supplement). No unhealthy fillers like cellulose (found in a so called healthy dog food recommended by vets).  My dog has really responded to his Instant Pot meals.  How many 17 year old dogs can trot freely and like to play?I eat a lot of beans and grains.  This pot lets me eat whole grains and beans that have not been milled beyond recognition.  Meats are juicer and I can do up a week's worth of food for lunch and dinner.  (Funny, if you eat a very healthy lunch, you don't really feel like pigging out at dinner).  I also proof bread in it."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love this little pot.  It is plenty big enough for two people.  It is so easy to use and the clean up is minimal.  So far I have not made anything that didn’t turn out very welll.  I boil eggs, and the shell almost falls off, even fresh eggs.  Chicken breasts are so flavorful and juicy, and hot Chile in minutes is fantastic.  Soup in winter is the best, prep the Vegetables and then sauté in the. Pot for great flavor, add the liquid, put on the cover, and the best part, walk away and let it work it’s magic.  So much time saved.  I just ordered one for my son and daughter in law, they raved over the chicken I made in it."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I took extra precaution to learn how to use this thing. I’d been too scared to buy one until now. My daughter said this one's so quick and easy to use, plus the cooked food’s delicious too.My first two ""Initial Test Runs"" failed, and I thought my unit was defective. After reading much earlier reviews about poor customer service response, I was going to ship it back to Amazon, but I’m so glad I called Instant Pot first. They answered almost immediately and assured me that the problem was not my unit but an error in my instruction manual which they have since corrected.So, if you’re like me — obsessed with reading reviews BEFORE purchasing items, and obsessed with reading manuals and testing products BEFORE using them — here's the CORRECTION: Instead of adding water to the “3” mark on the inner pot as posted in their “Initial Test Run” instructions, use only “3 CUPS WATER” instead. I ran a third test using these new instructions from the customer service rep, and my unit is NOT defective!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have a long history of wanting gadgets because I’ve heard a lot about them and they’re shiny and new. I held off on buying the instant pot for a long time because I have a slow cooker and a rice cooker, but eventually I caved and bought one. It is AMAZING. I started slow, with ribs and sweet potatoes. My obsession kicked into high gear when I bought Melissa Clark’s new cookbook, Dinner in an Instant. Dried bean soups ready in less than an hour! Delicious chicken soups and stews! I’ve used it at least twice a week with amazing results.So why do I love it when my slow cooker has been gathering dust for years? It’s so quick and easy!- Slow cooker recipes tend to be bland and mushy. Not so with the instant pot. If anything, the flavor is more concentrated.- My slow cooker pot is heavy ceramic and is difficult and awkward to clean. The instant pot liner is lightweight and cools down quickly, so I can clean it before any food dries and sticks.- Also, I’m not a morning person and the last thing I want to do after I wake up is prep raw meat and chop things for dinner. With the instant pot, I start dinner when I get home from work and it’s ready—usually within an hour and without constant monitoring.Being able to sauté in the same pot is fantastic too for adding flavor. I haven’t tried the yogurt settting, but look forward to trying it. I ignore most of the presets and rely on manual. I’m an instant pot convert now and can’t stop raving about it to my friends and family. If you get an instant pot, do yourself a favor and pick up Melissa Clark’s cookbook too. If you’re at all a foodie, you’ll love her recipes. I haven’t been disappointed yet."
1.0 out of 5 stars,I bought this and the seal didn't work. Therefore it wouldn't pressurize and just leaked everywhere. I tried returning this and UPS was suppose to pick up. So I had it in the lobby in our building. It never got picked up and now I can't return it. I bought it and was never able to use it. Very mad and disapointed.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I wish they had this 20 yrs ago.  Makes cooking everything quicker.  We can make a pot roast in 45 minutes - comes out nice and tender, very flavorful.I made some meat stew in it that was pretty delicious in about 1.5 hours, whereas I normally cook it 10-12 hours in the crock pot.  The veggies are soft, the meat is tender and everything's delicious.  Admittedly the flavor profile is more developed in the crock pot when I let it cook for 10-12 hrs, but for 1.5 hours, it tastes like it cooked about 4 hours in the crock pot - and when you've got a family army to feed - everyone goes away full and happy...Much more to experiment with soon..."
3.0 out of 5 stars,"This is our second Instant Pot.  Our first one was great, but we decided to get a little bigger one.  However, our one big disappointment was that the beans and lentils we cooked, came out dry and hard.  They give you a chart of how much of the beans, lentil, etc. to use, but the amount of water you need to put in the pot is in the tiniest letters ever that we didn't see that information for many weeks.  We just could not understand why they were coming out dry and hard even though we used the amount of water we used in our other instant pot.  So now we are using the amount of water for the amount of product they suggest, and it still is not coming out right yet.  We will need to experiment until we can get the right proportions.  It shouldn't be this way."
1.0 out of 5 stars,"If you have used a stove top pressure cooker you will be disappointed in the Instant Pot Duo Nova.  After cooking a few dinners with the outcome not matching my stove top pressure cooker I did some research.  I soon realized why the meals did not compare......the Instant Pot Duo Nova produces only 75% of the pressure my stove top pressure cooker produces.  So what does this mean?  Meats do not come out nearly as tender, even though cooking times were longer.  As an example I cooked stuffed artichokes.  After cooking them the suggested time,they were not anywhere near as tender as normal.  I ended up cooking them again for twice as long as I do in my stove top pressure cooker and they still were not half as tender as they are when cooked in the stove top pressure cooker. I then had to finish cooking them on the stove the old fashioned way! Don't waste your money....stick to the tried and true stove top pressure cooker!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"We both work for a living.  We have 2 kids that can be picky.  Needless to say, creating meals that satisfy my family that is also healthy can be a challenge.  After buying this and using it for a few months, it is one of the most valuable tools in the kitchen.  To me, every kitchen needs a toaster, microwave, Vitamix, good set of knives, a good nonstick skillet, a cast iron pan, and some triply stainless steel cookware.  For kitchen appliances, this is the fourth most used item in our kitchen next to our toaster, blender, and microwave.ProsMeat comes out tender and flavorful.  We have used chicken and beef and it works wonders.  I would say it has 90% of the taste of a crock pot meal, although you can also use this as a crock pot.Stews and harder grains are a breeze.  Cooking beans is about as foolproof as it can get once you figure out the correct settings and liquid.  You don’t even need to soak the beans (although it helps).  Rice comes out as good as it does on my Zojirushi rice cooker in a quarter of the time from start to finish.  This may be the easiest method to make solid chicken stock.  You can cook smaller cuts of meat from frozen.  Harder vegetables like root vegetables cook up nice and tender.Stainless steel bowl is generously sized and is easy to clean up.  You can put it in the dish washer with no worries other than possible discoloration.  The lid does not have any electronics so you can wash it under the sink.  Since you can take most of the unit apart, it is pretty easy to clean.  Cleaning was my biggest concern with the unit and it is quite easy.The construction of the unit is solid.  The keep warm feature works very well.  The little pieces on the inside are also steel.  The only item I think that would possibly break would be the pressure cooker plastic relief valve.  As long as you aren’t body slamming the unit, it should hold up for 3-5 years with regular use.If you prep your meal the night before, you can have many different types of healthy, fresh, one-dish meals ready for your family in under 30 minutes.ConsThe unit does not calculate the heat up time and depressurization time.  If the manual says chicken will take 14 minutes to cook, it is considering the time once everything is heated up and is not counting the depressurization time.  Plan accordingly.It is a pressure cooker so it takes a while to depressurize when it is done.  Usually, it takes a minute or two if you do it manually.  If you depressurize naturally, it can take 5 minutes or so.  The fuller the unit, the longer it takes to depressurize.The silicone ring gets discolored and absorbs smells.  You have to replace this ring once or twice a year.The unit can get very hot to the touch.  Duh.  Keep it out of reach of little ones.The pot is stainless steel so you are likely to get stuck on food at some point of use.Recipes are limited.  If you don’t know how to cook or experiment, you may get frustrated.Searing in this unit is possible, but it is really weak to get a good quality sear.SummaryOverall, I think this is an excellent unit.  Every kitchen should have one.  You can basically get crock pot food in a significantly faster time.  This unit shines with meat, soups, grains, hard veggies, and beans.  The unit will not replace every appliance in your house, but it serves its intended purpose quite well.  If I were to rank cooking appliances, you need a microwave first, then a toaster, then a good blender, then an electric pressure cooker, then a food processor, then a mixer."
4.0 out of 5 stars,I’ve used my friend’s 6qt to make stock and stews for parties and we always had a lot of leftover. So much that it took up a lot of fridge space. I wanted to continue to make soups and stews without freezing leftovers in my fridge. I am glad I got the 3qt. It’s perfect for 2-3people and it’s a space saver for sure. I highly recommend this to those who want home cooking but with limited living space. You won’t regret it. My 3qt will definitely be used often this winter!

5.0 out of 5 stars,"My mother always used a pressure cooker. I have always made stews, pot roasts, pork for shredded pork and, well, after  forty-some odd years, I depend on a pressure cooker using one at least once a week. When I needed a new one, I checked out stainless steel stovetop on Amazon. In the ""Customers Who Viewed This Item Also Viewed"" section, I saw the Instant Pot.The Instant Pot is everything they advertise. I will never again have to listen for the hiss-hiss to begin and then drop everything I'm doing and go adjust the electric stove knob in an attempt to get the interval of the pssst-pssst-pssst of the rocker set just right.There are many advantages to the Instant Pot. What I've noticed so far is how much less liquid I have to use. It seems as if I need less spices. The Steam Vent handle is aafe, quick and a lot easier than picking up my old Presto stovetop PC and taking it to the dink and running cool water over it until the pressure is down and it's safe to open. Meat ends up tender, but not as stringy as that cooked in the stovetop PC. Clean up is as easy as they say. The User Interface (front panel controls and displays) are straightforward and intuitive. The handy one page reference guide is all you'll need after you've done a quick read-through of the manual.And best of all, I won't have to depend on setting another timer or worry about mis-setting the timer, falling asleep and waking up to a Pressure Cooker run dry and have to go looking for Pressure Cookers on Amazon. Not that that's happened to me - just hypothetically speaking."
2.0 out of 5 stars,"UPDATED 8/2017 I've dropped this 5 star rating to 2. It is a PHENOMENAL product. BUT IT DOESN'T LAST! I've come to totally rely on this appliance as much as my old rice cooker, steamer, and crockpot combined. Each of those lasts 5-15 years. This lasted me TWO. Not okay with this.I have recommended this pot to numerous others, and just bought one for my mother-in-law getting ready to serve a mission. You seriously could get away with having this tool as your only cooking option for your kitchen. I wish I'd had it during our remodel!  I seriously do not need my old crockpot or pressure cooker, and only rarely use my old rice cooker/steamer anymore; pretty much only when I'm already using this guy for something I'm wanting to serve over rice. I take it camping and it's come in so handy for days when we're exhausted and just don't want to wait for hot coals to eat. I'm planning to see if I can just boil water in it on the sautee setting for making dehydrated meals this year. I can't imagine it wouldn't work perfectly for that. I could also just bring whole rolled oats and make hot cereal using the ""porridge"" function, too.PROSI LOVE that the lid locks on (no more spills in the car when transporting food! Hooray!)Love the carrying handleStainless steel pot makes cleanup SO easy. You can even use those metal scrubbers on it for tough burnt-on food... not that I ever burn my food...7 tools in 1. SO versatile it's crazy.Saute feature is fantastic for browning meat before slow cooking, but also means you can make fried rice/rice pilafs in here. Or evaporate off any extra liquid from your dish at the end of cooking. Or brown your pulled pork at the end for that nice BBQ feel. Love it!Seal/vent feature on the lid means you can lock in moisture for pressure cooking/slow-cooking something you don't want to dry out, OR you can open it up and let the liquids evaporate as you slow cook if it's turning out a bit too wet.I love the timer function. You can put in your frozen ingredients in the morning, set the timer to start cooking in the afternoon, and have dinner done by the time you come home. Trust me, it's worth your time to read the user manual!Pressure cooking ability means frozen meat isn't a deal breaker at dinner time. Throw it in anyway, it will be done in an hour or less (depending on what you're making). So awesome.You can easily switch from one setting to another. Slow cook your dinner and find it's dinner time & not done? Pressure cook it the rest of the way. Pressure cooked meal turn out too moist? Turn it on saute and let the liquid evaporate out.CONSIt only lasts a year or two. Something with a beautiful stainless steel pot, great quality exterior, shouldn't be disposable! I've had mine going on two years and it just stopped working. No warning, just dead. I've emailed the company but I've had many other friends with the same issue and they say there's a reason the warranty is only one year."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"After hearing and reading about this pressure cooker for the past couple of years, and proudly resisting the urge to buy one, I finally read what Consumer Reports had to say about it (in their November 2017 issue, ""A Closer Look at a Very Popular Pot""). They evaluated this exact model, the DUO60 6 Quart 7-in-1, and here are some of their comments: it ""is what it claims to be"", ""it's faster and easier than cooking on a stovetop"", and they concluded by saying that its only deficiency was that it lacks the power to sear meat, so it couldn't brown their Kung Lao chicken: ""But that's all we found to complain about after putting this pot through its paces - and that's really saying something"".Well, that was enough, the straw that broke the camels back, so to speak, and I promptly ordered this

   written by Melissa Clark because I had read her article in the New York Times ""Why Do Cooks Love the Instant Pot®? I Bought One to Find Out"" recently and that was another of the reasons that I had finally succumbed to the call of the Instant Pot.So far, I consider this to be money very well spent. I'd suggest reading Anne Mitchells excellent and comprehensive review for much more detail on using the Instant Pot than I'm able to provide here. We like that the Instant Pot can be used independently of the stove top, and especially appreciate all of the built in choices for cooking various recipes and types of food. It's going to take some time to fully explore its full capabilities."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"i was thinking about getting an air fryer but putting it off because we have a TINY kitchen. then, the skies parted and a ray of light came from the heavens and showed me this amazing lid for my pre-existing instant pot and the rest is history. i haven’t had it that long so i’ve only used it for wings, thighs and drumsticks but i am in love, and it’s even got me pulling out the instant pot more in general to use for pressure cooking etc. There’s only 3 of us in my family so it’s plenty big enough to do what i need to do, and maybe even have leftovers. However, it might not accommodate enough for a large family, so that’s pretty much its only drawback in my eyes. otherwise, it’s perfect for my needs and stored away easily. love."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I’m a very busy individual but I care what I put into my body. Sometimes I don’t get home after work and then the gym until 6:30, and by then dinner should have already been cooked. Being able to put a meal on the table for my husband and I with minimal time and ingredients means so much to me. Received this as a birthday present from my mom and it fits the perfect amount of food for two, I’d recommend any more than that to get a larger size. I’ve used it for everything from 4 minute rice to ribs, barbacoa, and even boiled eggs! This thing does everything!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Perfect for a single guy who hates stressing about feeding himself healthy meals. I just added steak strips with olive oil, thyme, salt pepper. Then on top rice, water vegetables, chipotle chili spice and pressed the pressure cook button. 40min later is was done without hardly any mess or prepping. Plus all the flavors really popped out because the pressure cooking thing did something amazing to the spices. I didnt even have to measure anything either. I call this product, ""The Food Man Machine"""
5.0 out of 5 stars,"So, this handy gadget is most likely going to completely displace slow cookers in my kitchen. It really is (so far), as great as it's made out to be. My first dish in the Instant Pot was pasta sauce. The saute function worked beautifully for browning the meat, and the sauce was done in a grand total of two hours (browning, heating, cooking, depressurizing), vs the 6 to 8 hours it would have taken on the stove. The one downside to cooking the sauce in this vs on the stove top is that the sauce didn't reduce and thicken any, like it does on the stove, which is easily countered by making the base thicker to begin with. I'll be making cheesecake with it at some point (how could I not?), as well as yogurt. And pot roast, and bbq pulled pork, and soups and stews... There will be a bit of a learning curve with seasonings, you can't just sample and adjust in the middle of cooking with this unit.The lid can be a little tricky to clean, there are a lot of little spots stuff can get into and you can't just drop it into a sink full of water. The insert you cook in is heavy stainless steel, with what appears to be an aluminum core bottom. I kind of wish there was some way to disable the chime that sounds when you open and close the lid, it scares my dog. The cookbook has some great looking recipes in it, but... Half of the cookbook is written in Kanji, and from the photos it looks like mostly different recipes than the English section.I bought extra silicone seal rings with the unit, based on reviewer's recommendations. One ring will be for savory cooking, the other for sweets. I can see just a touch of discoloration of the seal ring from just the one use (no real surprise, tomato stains everything) but can't detect any absorbed smells yet."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love this so much more than my old Crock-Pot. It sat on my counter a couple of weeks because I was so intimidated, but 85% of my meals are made with the Instant Pot now. I primarily use the manual pressure cooker mode, although I've also used Steam, Meat|Stew, and Saute.I planned to make a cheesecake when I realized the sealing ring perma reeks of savory spices, regardless of how I wash it. I recently ordered two more rings, red and blue, so I can have a specific, non-smelly sealing ring to use for desserts. I also got one of the 7-piece accessory kits, although I've only used the steamer basket and tongs so far.I love that I don't have that ""oops I waited too long to start dinner"" moment I had with the slow cooker. Although if I *am* cognizant enough of the time, I can still slow cook if I want. And the meat. The meat is always delicious.I'm not a prolific experimenter, so I can't speak to all of its functions, but it's more than a replacement for my slow cooker. I used to cook maybe one day every two weeks, and now I cook two to three times a week. Which doesn't sound like much, but it is for me, especially considering that I'm only cooking for two and always have leftovers. And to only have a pot and lid to clean afterward (and probably a cutting board and measuring cup and knife) is incredibly freeing. I like coordinating a meal made on the stove, in the oven, and in the microwave sometimes, but usually juggling pots and pans is not fun, especially when I have a double sinkful to wash later. The Instant Pot is much better for my mental health."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've been calling it my magic pot and using it almost every day since I got it. My family thinks I'm a little nuts, but I love this gadget. It makes cooking things like ribs and chicken so easy! It is small, though, so if you have a big family you'll want the larger one, but this size is great for our family of 3, and so useful for making veggies and soups and stews, and yesterday I made a little cheesecake! It came out great! Such a time saver, too."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"I am coming from the power pressure XL  style cooker. The inner pot non-stick is just a turn off as it leaches. So I decided to try the InstantPot.  This model works as advertised, bone broth in two hours that was thourogh, short rib stew with turnips in an hour. Making some yogurt right now.  It only lacks a high enough working pressure for canning. It does steam bath can quite well. Highly recommend for anyone who wants to save time and eat better.  Mine is getting lots of use. I think anyone who wants to get into pressure cooking will enjoy this product. I find the 8 quart size to be very handy."
2.0 out of 5 stars,"Bought this primarily as a rice cooker and for stews and such.  It's really inferior for all functions.  Rice fails every time with a hard clump of semi-burnt rice on the bottom.  Stews are no different than cooking on a stovetop.  Maybe it's a bit faster but as it's all sealed up you can't adjust spices and salt and such as it cooks like you can with a pot that you can uncover.  This is for lazy people that don't like cooking or flavor in their foods.  Literally nothing is improved by this device other than saving a bit of time.  I tried it a lot when I first got it... ""new toy syndrome"" but several months later it's sitting in the cupboard unused and is probably going to the garage awaiting a yard sale or something.Very disappointed."
1.0 out of 5 stars,I ended up sending this back. I used it 4 times and 3 times the pot vented steam out the lid and wouldn't seal properly.  I made sure the lid was clean and the gasket was forced down over the lip in the lid before starting the pot.  I have another pot of another brand and have never had problems with sealing.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought the larger one last year and because I cook a lot and like to freeze leftovers. It was too big for my space. I like to cook soups and sauces in the slow cooker. Well the slow cooker broke and was left with nothing but the stove and microwave. No time saving there. So I bought this one. Much smaller but I am so pleased I did. I hate cooking rice. Hate it on the stove. Hate everything about it but I have cooked so much rice in this pot that I won’t have to do it again for months. Freezes great in double ziplock bags. (They are now reusable too.). I can sauté, pressure cook, slow cook. All in one pot. I love it. Have used it everyday, sometimes multiple times, since I got it. Bring on soup season."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have heard so much about it and finally i decided to try. I regret i didn't buy this earlier it is literally one of the most useful tool in the kitchen. I cook everything in it, it is so fast, hassle free and it retains flavor much better than the traditional cooking method. I even retired my rice cooker! can you believe?I cooked: chicken soup, just delicious. took 30 minutes much faster than just boiling and used much less water and the flavor is more intense because it doesn't loose any water.Porridge. Then i take out the chicken save some soup and use the chicken stock with rice and add more collar green carrots and kale to cook vegetable porridge. The best porridge i have ever tasted. And it cook the porridge in 20 minutes and it is delicious. Much faster than rice cooker which takes 80 minutes.Steam vegetable and dumplings: as chinese we steam a lot things, but its hard to steam thing regularly but sooo fast and easy in instant pot! i steam things all the time now. Make my meal much healthier.I have many other recipe i want to try, i just love this pot sooo much! I can just put it in and go take a shower, not to worry about burning the pot which happen to me all the time! I recommended my friend who also told me she loved it so much. I highly recommend!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I LOVE it!  My wife commutes so often dinner is up to me and she will only eat pizza so many times before I get ""The Look"".  So I decided to try this out. Wow, it's pretty easy and I am no cook. I like that I can brown right in the pot and just toss everything else on top and set it to cook. Lots of recipes on Pinterest and I'm told there is a whole following on Facebook.It does rice and it turned out pretty good.I've also done chicken breasts, boneless pork loin chops and salisbury steak meatballs. So far so good. I saw a couple of reviews of people saying the silicon ring in the lid started to smell like something they cooked. I didn't give the comment much credence but sure enough on the second dish I made I sues some strong spice and the next time I used the Instant Pot I could definitely smell it..and yes I clean it thoroughly every time I sue it. I don't getting any residual taste from it though so no worries, just thought it was interesting ."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"Once over the initial fear of using this little gem, I'm now a bit hooked.  I wouldn't cook all my meals in here as some claim to do, but as a meal prep person, I find this to be a perfect tool.  It's quick (once it heats up and once you get the pressure released... add 15-30 minutes to what IP recipes tell you), easy for clean up and also takes the place of other appliances in the kitchen so storage isn't a big deal.  If you meal prep or like to have a couple of evenings a week to come home, make a good meal and then sit around enjoying your evening then this gadget is worth the $$."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"The first thing made was all inclusive spaghetti and it turned out perfect in about 1/2 hr. max including prep. I put that into a different pot and set it aside for later. I then made Sous Vide Steak for the first time in my life. I popped those steaks into the pot and forgot about them. I got some house chores done, then went to visit a friend. Hours later I came home and by this time I was hungry. I seared those steaks and heated up the spaghetti. OMG! It was delicious. So easy, and so versatile. I can't believe how good that steak was. Now I can have company for dinner and actually spend more time with friends rather than in the kitchen."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"Cooks everything excellently. The best uses are for rice, squash, and meats because it cooks them perfectly every time and really quickly.Only downside is that sometimes the pressure poppet does not pop up on it's own or takes too long overcooking your food. A easy solution I found is once its heated up and the poppet is starting to move lightly press down on the lid to give it a pressure boost to push the pin up so that it can start cooking at the right pressure and run the timer."
1.0 out of 5 stars,Product was delivered with no Condensation Collector inside the carton box and now I'm facing difficulties without it. Condensed steam is coming out of the cooker and spoiling the surface on where I'm putting the cooker during cooking.
3.0 out of 5 stars,"I love it for cooking dried beans. No more lugging cans into the house. I’m a vegan, so I haven’t used it for meats. It’s great for curries and other bean dishes. That’s about it. It is a big appliance so you need to have room to store it. I have a rice cooker sitting on the counter already, along with the other usual appliances, so I really had to scramble to find a place for this beast. And it’s not good for rice- the rice totally stuck to it. My rice cooker has a Teflon insert. This doesn’t."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I am pretty late jumping on the Instant Pot bandwagon, but I’m very glad that I did! I ordered this pot before Christmas to help with cooking for the many people that come and go during the holidays. My kitchen is small and I can use all the help I can get. The first few things I cooked in it were large amounts of Jasmine rice and quinoa. Both turned out perfectly! Then I used it to cook potatoes and ‘boiled’ eggs for potato salad and that turned out great also. I’ve made a huge pot of IP Mac and cheese several times that was a big hit and also I’ve used it to make beef stew, boiled chicken for chicken salad and fresh corn on the cob. Everything has turned out well and I keep going back to this handy gadget over and over. My only complaint is the slow cooker portion, I put on a huge pot of black eyed peas and ham for New Years Day and they weren’t done after cooking on high for 10 hours. It was an easy fix though bc I pressure cooked them for 15 minutes when we were ready to eat and they were delicious. This pot hasn’t moved off my counter in the 2 months that I’ve had it and I find myself using it multiple times per week which makes it a terrific purchase for me!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,Makes a GREAT crispy coating and that nice crisp flavor of whatever oil you’re using. (Just make sure to spray it with some kind of oil while air frying)
5.0 out of 5 stars,"OMGosh! Was curious about this product for a while, but didn't get one because we already had a stovetop pressure cooker. And a rice cooker. And a slow-cooker. Our daughter bought one and after she'd been using it I asked her. With 2 small children underfoot, she said it made a difference in a home cooked meal vs go-to-the-freezer-get-the-box. Since I bought one, have used it every week. Sometimes even twice a day! Can make ""boiled"" eggs very, very easily (use the rack, about 1-1/2 cups water & the rice setting - either pressure release). Had to make 2 batches of roasted butternut soup in under 2 hrs - nailed it! The ease and quietness of this is wonderful, too. One thing to remember, if new to pressure cooking, is to allow time for pressure building up and whatever pressure release time you're using (which is still shorter than making anything with a comparable result). The little recipe book that comes with it is good for getting you started, and has some decent recipes. Would also advise getting one of the well-reviewed cookbooks designed for an electric pressure cooker. I went ahead and bought the glass lid (for slow-cooking) because none of my other pot lids would fit. Of course :-) Is it necessary? Actually, not really, but is nice when it's serving time for a buffet. Is this multi-functional in a practical way? So far, I'd say yes. There are extra stainless steel (another plus)  inserts available, so changing from one method/dish to another can be done quickly and easily. Even without one (as in the case of the 2 batches of butternut soup), it's easy enough to empty, wash and get cooking again. Yes, the saute feature is great, too. If you want to know about the other features I haven't used yet, keep reading reviews because certainly, someone else has used them!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased the 8 quart size and I love it! I was a little intimidated at first, mainly the idea of a pressure cooker and the thought of them blowing up, but this machine is awesome! There are a lot of safety mechanisms in place so you don't need to worry about that. Just follow the directions and keep all vents clear from obstructions. As other reviewers said there is a learning curve at first. I have never used or owned a pressure cooker (just slow cookers) and it didn't take me long at all to get the hang of it. I read the manual that comes with it. My manual had a different looking lid with a part that was supposed to come out but mine didn't. I contacted the customer service number and I got a hold of someone right away who informed me that I had the newest model and the booklet I had hadn't been updated yet. It was very reassuring so if you have questions there are lots of articles online and the costumer service was great. I was looking for a steamer to steam vegetables as my little baby food cooker wasn't big enough for my growing family and my sister in law recommended this. I'm glad she did! It does everything. Steaming vegetables is taking some tweaking. I have tried the timer guidelines in the included book but I noticed my vegetables were coming out too soft. For my frozen broccoli I now just do 1 minute of low pressure cooking with a quick release and they are very soft but not mush. There is some trial and error but even when I mess up things are still edible and taste great. I have done a whole roast (with potatoes, carrots, and gravy) all in the one pot included, pork roast, steamed vegetables, potatoes, hard boiled eggs, etc. I could go on and on! I highly recommend this product."
1.0 out of 5 stars,"I loved my instant pot until it continued to register pressure on high when there was none at all, just burned food underneath much-evaporated liquid.  I'd just replace the gasket if there weren't the issue of registering pressure when none exists.  I called the 800 # in the user manual and I held the line for ONE ENTIRE HOUR, unavoidably hearing the nervous noise they probably call ""music"", which was periodically interrupted by a recorded voice apologizing for any ""inconvenience"" the delay was causing. Then, after an hour of waiting, it hung up on me! There is no call back option.  I'm throwing my instant pot in the trash & NEVER buying anything of that brand again."
5.0 out of 5 stars,Recently single I wanted to explore some cooking options to avoid eating out all the time.  This product has been awesome.  I have used multiple settings for various items and I just love the way everything tastes.  Cleanup is easy since the liner comes out.  I would say a person would not need this one for everyday items.  Its selling point is the addition of a few preset buttons.  Those functions can be used on cheaper ones no problem.  I do have a hard time seeing the text on the buttons.  They are silver with thin letters embossed.  Also you have to get at eye-level to read the display.  Not had any issues with odor on the seals yet.  Not needed any extra accessories either.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have a lot of kitchen appliances, basically everything you can imagine: vitamix blender, food processor, dehydrator, rice cooker, pressure cooker, waffle iron, juicer, etc. Needless to say my kitchen is full! That's the first plus of the Instant Pot, 3 of my appliances (plus some) are now in 1! More counter space! Yay!I primarily eat at home and I cook A LOT. I only cook unprocessed, healthy, plant based foods so it can be quite time consuming and difficult at times. I'm a full time student, Mom to 4 pets, I work, have a boyfriend, train on my bike, and practice yoga daily. I'm SUPER busy which is reason number 2 why I decided to give the Instant Pot a go and it hasn't disappointed me! I've only had it for a week and I've already saved hours in the kitchen!One other benefit that I wasn't planning on is less dishes and easier clean up. I can sauté garlic and onions, add in other ingredient, let it boil, then throw on the top and pressure cook it without ever changing pans and in 1/2 the amount of time. This makes my life so much easier!Without any reservations I can say that the Instant Pot is the best kitchen appliance I have ever owned and I imagine the longer I have it the more I'll love it. I've used it every day since it's arrived, sometimes 3 times a day! I've made split pea soup, steel cut oats, millet porridge, sweet potatoes, rice, lentils, and I even tried my hand at making vegan yogurt for the first time, it was SO EASY and AMAZING! I'm just absolutely blown away with how great this thing is and how easy it is to use!It's so great that I talked my Dad into getting one and he LOVES it! He's a bachelor who lives in a space that doesn't have an oven, or much of a kitchen right now which makes cooking difficult for obvious reasons. Thanks to the Instant Pot he's eating at home more often and he says he ""doesn't even feel like he's cooking.""Long story short, everyone should own an Instant Pot! I wish I could give it more than 4 stars! And for the price I got it for on Cyber Monday?!?! I can't even believe it! It's already paid for itself!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I’ve been using an instant pot 6 quart model for better than three years and love it.  I use it for soups, stews and big yummy pots of beans and rice, etc…  Basically Ford big cooking jobs I eat over the week… Sunday cookies…  simple and delicious! With the mini I’m taking it to the next level. Now i use my Insta pot once or twice daily… PIP cooking mostly.  It’s a great little unit that has the same quality I expect from Insta pot but a variety of handy new feachres that I appreciate as well…"
1.0 out of 5 stars,"So.....tried it out but.....1). It is really only 1.5 quarts, per instructions you can’t fill past half way safely2) there is no loyal time shown, it takes a random time to heat to pressure and then counts down, but it’s another 5-10 minutes to cool to open!3). The rice button overcooked the rice to a stodgy mess!4) there is no handle on the inner cooking container so it easily slips and spills and makes a big mess!5) cleaning will be a big mess6) when it cools after cooking rice it splattered starchy water all around puns for three feet in every direction7) there is a sticker on the top in mainly french, if you try to take it off there is a revolting yellow residue left on the silver top!All in all too fiddly, not a lot quicker allowing for cooling, and you can’t see what is going on!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I’ve had my Duo 9-1 model for over two years and it’s become a staple in my kitchen. I’ll admit it sat on my counter for about 6 months, I was terrified to use it - learning curve and all- but I was being silly. Once I plunged in (I boiled water, lol), I found it very easy to use. It operates exactly as advertised. It makes nice oatmeal, although I do prefer steel cut oatmeal in my rice maker. It makes great soups ... and stew! I’ve never had such tender, flavorful beef in stew before. I cook chicken breast ahead and shred to freeze for quick dinners. Yogurt is basically pour and leave, no fussing and it comes out beautifully. The sauté feature is one I usually extend longer than the recipes state but who browns meat in 2-3 minutes anyway? So watch that, and let it heat a little before adding the meat. Deglazing in the pot is easy, the stainless surface performs well. As long as I follow the recipe requirement for liquids, nothing burns. And veggies are the best in the IP! Green beans have never cooked so perfectly, or corn on the cob, or .... all of them.I’ve read some low-rated comments about the pot failing after a short period of time, but I haven’t had any trouble with mine and it’s been a while. There’s quite a bit of steam when you choose “quick-release” so make sure your unit isn’t under a cabinet. There are attachments you can buy to redirect the steam to a side; they look like a silicone periscope. ;)"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Out of the box, I was impressed with how well this unit is made. The construction is exceedingly sound as it has to be to pressure cook safely. There is a short learning curve but youtube videos take the guesswork out of the equation (I love twosleevers.com!). I was a bit intimidated by the higher end model and am glad that I chose this particular model as it suits my needs/preferences perfectly. I was able to make fantastic beef stroganoff and fried rice. Chicken comes out moist and tender. I choose pour in pot recipes for quick, easy and healthy meals with minimal prep and cleanup. Just waiting on my Fat Daddio pans so I can try some wholesome desserts! Can't believe I waited so long to take the plunge. This really is a game changer for when you want really healthy food that tastes amazing and you need it/want it quickly."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great quality!  Was thinking about sending this back after I ordered it.  Was at Costco and found the ""As seen on TV"" Power Pressure cooker XL for $50 less.  I was trying to figure out the difference and watched a few YouTube videos.  Here is what I liked: stainless steel pot vs aluminum non-stick coating pot (would never look clean after using), Pressure release assemble much simpler and easier to clean, internal lid is all stainless steel with no aluminum liner lid part. Two heating setting vs one.  I never used the Power Pressure but construction looked cheap and would not hold up near as well.  I really was planning on sending back to Amazon the Instant Pot after seen the lower priced Costco product but the Instant Pot quality was worth it to me."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I marked easy to clean as middle of the road, as I hate to wash pots pans dishes, anything. But I made Bolognese rigatoni for the first meal in the IP last night and my husband took one bite and said ""This is delicious"". He had no idea how I'd made it. I'm part Italian and I cook pasta and sauces often. The IP rigatoni was awesome, and all in one pot!!! I do mind the silicone ring, however. It seems floppy and not very durable. I have used a Presto pressure cooker since my marriage in 1974. It was a shower gift and it had a sealing ring that lasted thirty years. No special treatment or cleaning. I do appreciate the bells and whistles of the IP, no more standing at the stove adjusting the pressure and telling the kids ""Stand back! It's going to blow!""  I did use a fork to move the pressure valve from steam to vent. No point in getting a burn. And only one pot to wash!!  If the sealing ring is rather short-lived and it picks up cooking odors, why doesn't the IP maker include an extra seal ring in the original package. Seems like an inexpensive solution to a common issue."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is a very good kitchen gadget. I can make really good meal in 1/4 the time.Rib is my favorite so far. From freezer to table is like 30 minutes top. Here’s my recipe:Smothered dry rub on your frozen rib with salt and pepper.Place in the rack, with 1 cup water.Seal and turn on pressure cook.After 23-25 minutes, take it out of the pot, put on the baking dish, smothered with bbq sauce and put on oven for Broil around 3 minutes both sides.You will have a fall off the bone and very tasty bbq, better than any bbq from the restaurants.Seriously!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've pressure cooked the majority of dinner meals for the past several years. Got in the habit while rv'ing in the heat of a Texas summer. My previous one (Power Cooker brand) had an inner pot with non-stick coating which had begun peeling and generally disappearing. Plus, desperately needed a new sealing gasket. Finding those replacement items for an off-brand, guaranteed to fit correctly, took way too much time AND was going to be over $50!! Well, with Amazon's Black Friday pricing, just replacing my old pressure cooker with this Instant Pot made the most sense (and cents, lol).LOVE IT. Am totally in love with itsheavy-duty beautiful Stainless Steel inner pot. It functions flawlessly, and seems to get up to pressure a little faster than my old cooker did.Really feels solidly made and top quality all around. Plus I know I'll never need to worry again about finding reasonably priced replacement parts (and accessories). Was able to add a 4-year warranty for only a few dollars. And now can take advantage of the tons of Instant Pot specific recipes out there, without worrying about converting them to work perfectly with an off-brand with a slightly different psi.Really I've wanted to upgrade my pressure cooker to an Instant Pot for quite some time. Glad I finally did!!!"
1.0 out of 5 stars,"Recently had experienced an instant (no pun) pressure release caused by what looks to me the seal slipping past the seating ring on right side of the unit (when facing the unit).  This caused the steel cut oats which were just at a boil to become tiny projectiles and spray the entire kitchen, as well as my laptop, which I was working from on the kitchen table some 6 feet away.  Luckily none of these projectiles hit me in the eye, which could have led to a far worse outcome than me spending hours to clean the mess.  The lid stayed on the unit, but a large enough opening occurred to eject the contents everywhere.  Some background on this unit -- it is the DUO Plus 3 Qt. and I purchased it about 13 months ago.  Shortly after receiving it and using it a few times I found that I would have an issue with getting a good seal.  Pressure would not build and you could see that steam vapor was escaping from a section of the lid.  I see I had contacted instant pot support a few weeks after purchase regarding this.  Ended up getting a new set of seals from instant pot (at no charge), and as they arrived I changed it out.  The problem persisted, however, intermittently, leading up to the seal failure about 2 weeks ago.  Just to add, I do have a DUO Plus 8 Qt which I've owned for 2 years now, and have had zero problems with.  So, take it for what you will -- can very well be that the 3 Qt unit just was a defective machine.  I am a bit wary about being anywhere near these units when pressurized.  When they work, they are wonderful, but when pressure is released in an instant and the contents are hot, and become projectiles; there is some concern for safety."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased this because we had a foundation slab leak and cooking on my stove/oven was going to be very inconvenient until the repair/renovation on the downstairs was complete. I thought I might still be able to cook upstairs with this and decided to give it a shot. I gotta say this has been the best thing to come out of this household disaster. This one appliance makes it possible to do a one-pot meal even with recipes requiring browning, sauteeing, simmering, and pressure cooking. I received it only 3 days ago and prepared 2 meals with it. Both were ridiculously delicious and tasted as if I'd spent hours cooking. The UI couldn't be any easier and there are a lot of electric pressure cooker cookbooks out there for newbies like myself. I was thrilled to see my subscription to Kindle Unlimited gave me access to at least 10 of them. I'm now regretting my previous purchase of a crockpot a few months ago as this appliance will do that job, too. Tonight I made the best mushroom pot roast I've ever served. The appliance seared and browned the chuck roast beautifully, sauteed the onions, garlic and mushroom like a champ, and cooked the tough meat and potatoes liked I'd spent hours on it. No knife was needed as the meat and potatoes were fork-tender with 90 minutes of cooking. I was able to make an amazing gravy with the cooking liquid by removing the meat and potatoes and adding a corn starch/water slurry. I put the meat, potatoes, and gravy aside and then sauteed a pound of mushrooms in the pot, reducing the liquid and getting a nice browning on them. I put the meat/potatoes/gravy back in with the sauteed mushrooms and simmered for a few minutes. The results were incredible. I'm seriously in love with this electric pressure cooker."
5.0 out of 5 stars,Love my Instant Pot!! There is kinda a learning curve BUT I found this YouTube channel to follow and he has taught me everything I need to know.He is JEFF at Pressure Luck cooking since following him I am COMPLETELY comfortable with using myInstant Pot!!!
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Took some time to learn recipes but we use this all Winter long.  Beef stew in so little time.  Pea soup so yummy. There are a few tricks to using one so it helps if someone can guide you to the tips..venting, safely adding items, and getting recipes for press cookers.  I had no one that had one so I figured it all out.  As they say it is not rocket science, but it did take me a few tries.  There are tons of recipes now too.  I got used cook books on Amazon to try a few ideas. Our slow pot used to simmer while I was at work...Not now.  I do prep some meals in the AM.  Keep in frig and start this pot right when I get home.  Dinner in an hour that use to take all day.  Some Oatmeal recipes are amazing too. Cleans up fast if you can soak the stainless steel pot for 30 mins. after use.  But I have not had any issues with food sticking. Again, this is different than the old slow pots but well worth the effort if you can just take the time to learn. About a foot high.  Cord comes off for storage.  similar weight to the bigger slow cook pots."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"My mistake when ordering. I thought I could use it to bake bread and potatoes. Nope. Steamed bread? Yep! Steamed/boiled potatoes? Yep!  But, not what I hoped for.AND forget the word instant and ignore the ridiculous cook times. The one cup minimum of liquid needs to come to a boil and release enough steam to pressurize the unit BEFORE the cook time starts. Afterwards meats and most other meals need 10-15 minutes of Natural Pressure Release before you can open the pot.I still rate it 5 stars because it does what it does so well. I'm still glad I purchased it.Tip: Don't buy a glass lid until you check what you already own.Get recipes from proven sites, not random Pinterest posts or blogs. Good ones include; Amy and Jackie, Hip Pressure Cooking,  Pressure Luck, Frieda Loves Bread."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought my Instant Pot last November during Black Friday, honestly it has been THE BEST PURCHASE I've done in a while. Everything just cooks perfectly every single time, it's so versatile and easy to use. I've made soups, creams, chicken, meat, fish, pasta, rice, quinoa, vegetables (spaghetti squash comes out perfect)...even apple crumble! It saves you time and you can cook in bulk (meal prepping just became waaaay easier). The one thing you have to keep in mind is constant cleaning, especially the silicone ring. It absorbs odors easily and getting rid of these is not that easy, I've tried baking soda, vinegar and soap and air drying and still some odors..but it's not a big deal. Don't even think twice about buying it, this is something you NEED in your life!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Pretty much everything great I ever heard about the Instant Pot is true in person.  It gets rice done quickly.  It pressure cooks mashed potatoes, turkey breasts, sausages...heck I can't remember all the stuff we've cooked.  All good.But get a good cookbook or use good online resources.  The Instant Pot is not quite like any other cooking method I've used.  Take rice, for example:  1 cup rice to 1 cup water; 2 cups rice to 2 cups water--any kind of rice.  ALL kinds of rice.  Same 1:1 ratio.  Plus maybe a sprinkle of salt, a twist of fresh ground pepper, couple bay leaves, and a large sprig of favorite herb.  Magic.My son likes the delayed start feature.  When he gets home with his kids from sports practice he just releases the pressure and serves dinner.  So it's all good."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love my instant pot.  There is an instant pot community on Facebook that allows you to search for anything and everything you’d ever want to know.  I took the advice of a friend who owns multiple sizes, and it was definitely good advice.  Always go bigger, you can always cook less.  When you need more room at some point, you’ll be stuck with the size you have. The 8 qt has been great cooking for a family of 3, and I have used it to make larger meals for family when they visit.  I have had one 8 qt for about 9 months, and got so used to using it, that I hardly ever use the oven or stove any more. I have also since decided that I used it so much that I needed another.  It’s been great. I can make potato salad or pasta in one, and simultaneously make the meat in the other."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I decided to caved and purchase an Instant Pot when the world went into a pandemic, which forced us all to stay home and cook for ourselves, so I was looking for something that would help in that area. I watched several YouTube videos to familiarize myself with how an Instant Pot works and decided it had a lot of features that would make it worth buying. Boy am I glad I did. Every recipe I've made in the pot has been delicious. It's opened up a whole new world for me in the culinary department.  There are soooo many recipes on the internet to choose from that are simple and easy. And clean up is very easy. You won't be disappointed with this product."
5.0 out of 5 stars,I had made red beans and rice as well as Vietnamese steamed loaf (cha trung).  I haven't quite figure out the cooking time yet so the red beans and rice ended up a little soupier than I normally prepare it.  I hope to make some dal makhani next. I am planning to buy the ceramic pot and already have bought the mini loaf pan for the next time that  I make the steamed loaf. Great buy!Just want to update my review.  I have been in touch with the customer service at Instant Pot to get a replacement for the lid because I had dropped it on the floor and  a piece of plastic broke off the handle.  It didn't affect the functioning of the pot as far as I could tell. They have provided excellent customer service and have responded to my emails promptly.  They had offered a slight discount for the replacement lid.  I was very impressed with Julz at Instant Pot customer service.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Everything I make with this is better by FAR than the pan versions. I even make popcorn and cake in mine. It can do almost ANYTHING and replaces everything but the microwave. The rice that it makes is beyond divine. Regular ungarnished large Idaho baking potatoes come out so flaky and almost buttery on their own. I have made soups, stews, slow cooker recipes, I have even fried burgers in it on saute... and I have owned it about 2 weeks. Literally an actual miracle of technology."
5.0 out of 5 stars,Birthday gift for my husband. He really wanted one of these to make homemade yogurt. We made some pretty killer Greek yogurt in it overnight. It was super easy and it turned out sooo good. Very smooth and creamy. Worth it just for that.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I had problems with this at first.  I have a Mealthy 6 qt but wanted to bump up in size to 10 qt.  I had problems building pressure to start, the instructions say to do a water pressure out of the box, I skipped that step.  I am not sure if there is a difference in the two brands...  I suppose it is more difficult to build pressure in a 10 qt than a 6 qt  my first project was spaghetti sauce and it would not come up to pressure, the 6qt does with the same sauce.  I probably did not have enough liquid to build pressure???  I did veggies today and it worked fine."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"It is awesome. We take it boon-docking and its perfect. It takes the place of various pots and pans. It definitely saves space which we need. The only thing that disappointed me was the fact that it draws so much power I believe 700 Watts so shorepower would be the best advantage and it would work awesome. We used our generator we have, a Yamaha 2000 and it just pulled that poor boy down and literally almost over loaded it with 700 Watts even with my 2000 watt generator it pulled it down quite a bit we figured it was 10% per hour is what it was drawing.  if you don't have to cook anything with it for a long. Of time is absolutely awesome if you have to cook something for over 4 hours I would suggest shorepower."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have had this product for a couple of years now.  When I first got it there weren't many recipes to be found to cook from.  But now!  Recipes are everywhere- facebook, on the website, and on many other sites.  Though my Instapot has many features, I usually just cook under pressure for the 30 minute default time.  Meat always falls off the bone, and seasoning is embedded in the food making everything delicious.  I have used it so much that the stainless steel liner is just now showing scrub marks and one or two tiny pitted places.  The other thing I am happy about with the new revolution in everyone getting one of these? Parts are readily available.  I can order a new liner, a glass lid, a new gasket for the pressure lid..love that.  I like this pressure cooker a bit better than the usual old school ones mostly because I have a steam vent that can be manually operated.  Also, it keeps food on warm when the cycle is finished, and gives you options (many many options) for controlling your process.  When I purchased this I was planning a complete kitchen remodel.  This was the handiest thing during that time.  It is my go-to appliance more often than not, and I still try new things all the time.  Mine has seen hard use for more than 2 years now and is still going strong.  You get a lot of bang for your buck here, and I highly, highly recommend this product to anyone.  From the simplest of recipes like pot roast to the more complicated recipes you will love the one pot convenience, the speedy cook time, and the easy cleanup.  I had researched several of these products before purchasing, and I am very happy with my choice.  Get it!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Since I bought this I haven't used the stove.  Everything I make in it gets great!  Food has a better flavor than when made in a manual pressure cooker.This one pot cooking- from saute to pressure cook to slow cook all in one pot! Just put ingredients in- set the time- and go about your business.  When the time is up, It automatically sets to warm.Keep in mind that it only goes to about 11-12 psi.  That hasn't been an issue for me but I guess it would for canning (should be 15 psi).This is my first electric pressure cooker and I look forward to using it every day.  My husband asks me what am I going to put in the pot for dinner today, everyday!I even made hard boiled eggs to perfection.After I make a roast (a frozen roast in 45 minutes and it falls apart), I will remove the roast and let it rest.  In the meantime I will put my veggies in the broth from the roast, set it for 9 minutes.  What a time saver.I normally don't eat pork until I got this pressure cooker.  Pork falls apart!I do wish Instant Pot would come out with an 8 quart.Do yourself a favor and order an extra pot insert and a lid.One con would be the rubber seal picks up an odor from everything you make.  I wash it each time I use it and store it outside of the pot.I haven't used this to it's full potential yet, so I will update with more results."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Got both 3 qt and 6 qt Christmas 2018, but did not open until Christmas 2019. Got so excited I bought  2 more of the 8qt for my daughters. Wasted a whole year of better food, made at home. Once you try one, you won’t want to spend so much money eating out as often, and getting your kids or grandchildren involved is a wonderful way to let them learn how easy it is to make your own meals! Take them shopping with you and let them choose fresh vegetables with lots of color and it all cools up quick without a big mess in an instant pot. A lot different than the old time pressure cooker I had in the old days and so much fun!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This thing is a meal prepping machine. I have a small stove in my apartment and everything gets made in this now. One thing gets dirty. Less mess. Less clutter. And when I'm done using it, I pour a glass of water in it and pressure cook for 10 min. Boom. Clean. Also, there is an ENDLESS amount of recipes online. It's essentially a cult that my gf is a part of. Borderline addiction."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I get frustrated when people leave poor reviews or take stars away for arbitrary reasons. Even worse is doing it due to user error. I lamented for weeks and researched many different types of pressure cookers. I finally chose the Instant Pot Duo because it was priced at $49.99 on this past Prime Day. When it was delivered, I unpacked and immediately did the test cycle. I did it wrong, not noting to turn the steam valve to “seal.” When I tried the second time, the cycle ran without a hitch. I see poor reviews based on the quality of the User Manual and things like the unit no longer working when moisture/liquid got into the base of the unit, and nightmare customer service. I can’t speak to the last, but yes, the manual is a little vague, the recipes not impressive, but there are these things called Google and YouTube, so just try that. You’ll find anything you need. As for the moisture issue...it shouldn’t be a surprise that an electrical appliance shorts out if liquid gets into the heating element. Would you expect your toaster to work if you dribbled a little of your morning coffee into it? If the answer is “yes,” maybe these types of appliances aren’t for you? Just use reasonable care, and the unit should work without any problem.Since getting my Instant Pot Duo, I’ve used it almost everyday. I cooked a pound of black beans in 25 minutes without soaking, 2 pounds of brown rice in 23 minutes, a pound of fresh chicken tenders in 6 minutes. Today, I put a pound of frozen ground turkey in it with spices and a bit of stock. Set it for 20 minutes, then enjoyed time in the pool with my kids. Later, I released the remaining pressure, removed the lid and set it to sauté to cook off the liquid for a few minutes while I shredded lettuce and diced tomatoes for a delicious taco dinner. My husband asks everyday what the Instant Pot is making for dinner. These times don’t include the time for the Pot to reach the correct temperature or for release of pressure, so overall it’s not always faster than other cooking methods. But it’s all totally hands-off time that I can use to accomplish so many other things, not to mention I’m not heating up my whole house in the summer by using the stove and oven, so it’s energy efficient, too. And it’s been awesome for my Keto diet!!Buy it, read the safety guidelines and how to do basic operations. Then search for recipes and get to it. Just be careful not to splash liquid into the base:) Enjoy!"
1.0 out of 5 stars,"I've had this pressure cooker for over a year now, but have actually only been using it sporadically over the last 8 months - and only for cooking rice, actually. Because I only used it now and then, I always referred to the booklet that stated cooking times and procedures, just to make sure nothing was left out or done wrong. After about the 4th or 5th time of cooking white rice, I noticed that the body of the pot had changed; the entire outer frame was lopsided as if bent down in the front by force. The pot still stood solid, which is why I hadn't noticed earlier I guess, and it didn't seem to affect the inside, so I have cooked rice in it about 4-5 more times. Unfortunately, despite never changing the recipe, I got the ""burn"" signal the last two time despite using the usual and adequate amount of water. When I shut everything off, the rice wasn't brown but white and clumpy. Stopped using it altogether now. What a piece of junk!"
1.0 out of 5 stars,I used this all of 4 times over the last year.  When I went to cook a meal with it this Christmas it wouldn’t turn on.  I am extremely disappointed in this purchase and would not recommend it to others.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This air fryer lid is much larger than I had anticipated, but I am impressed with the quality and variety of functions. As soon as it arrived, I opened and tried out several vegan no oil recipes. Crunchy seasoned chickpeas turned out amazingly delicious. Potato fries, & even a carrot bacon recipe turned out perfectly cooked and crisped. This is going to be a great addition to our kitchen. I have a large dehydrator, but look forward to trying this accessory for smaller batches. Super easy to use, clean and store. NOTE: Pay attention to the compatibility because this unit is NOT compatible with ALL Instant Pot size/styles."
3.0 out of 5 stars,"Pressure cooker = 5 stars. Slow cooker = zero stars.The pressure cooker is excellent. I can make creme brulee in 9 minutes (25 total if you count time ro pressurize and depressurize if using wet towel to speed process up).If you are looking to buy this to replace your crock pot DON'T DO IT!!!!! On high it only goes to 186° F. I can make ghee in my cheap Hamilton Beach crock pot within 3-4 hrs. With this one it was still not done after 16 hrs! I finally gave up and went to bed. Stews are also not fully done in the same duration that a regular crock pot takes.In summary, if you need this purely as a pressure cooker go for it. It's excellent! If you are getting it for the crock pot feature, forget it! Hang on to that old crock pot."
5.0 out of 5 stars,I’M SOLD!! This is amazing! Never going back to a crock pot!! I have cooked a 3lb roast in an hour (6hrs in crock pot at least) Beef ribs in 35 min (falling off the bone) Chili and of course rice. My family loved the ribs!! So amazing!! Legit to die for!!! Next!! Cheesecake!!! Can’t wait!!! For a mother cooking for a family this saves you hours and doesn’t heat the kitchen up while doing it!!! Best decision ever!! Thankful my crock pot broke forcing me to buy one!!!’ 2 thumbs up👍👍

Please send to the above address ASAP. I do not see a receipt nor is it feasible to photo the silver label on the back of the appliance. Surely, the description copied and pasted from the item as found on Amazon.com is sufficient. It is a small plastic cup that fits near the outside of the rim. Thank you."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought this mainly because I kept hearing about it and it went on sale. I use it mostly for hard/soft boiled eggs and rice.My old rice cooker could make rice and also soft or hard boiled eggs, but it was MUCH slower. Rice took 45 minutes and hard boiled eggs, 25 minutes.The first thing I tried with the Instant Pot was 2 hard boiled eggs. They were ready in under 10 minutes total, from loading it with 1 cup of room temperature water to completely done. Amazing! Time is money and what I used to have to wait about 25 minutes for I can now do in under 10 minutes!Rice took about 12 minutes for 2 cups.! I can literally have friends over and if we decide to have some rice with our dinner, I can make it and have it completely ready while they are practically still just pouring drinks. Amazing!I also really like that the inner pot is stainless steel and not some non stick coating like my prior rice cooker was. I think it's healthier not to have coatings that could potentially flake off or leach in to your food.I'm a single guy and bought the 6 quart version which seems just about the right size.I'm excited to try cooking more dishes in my Instant Pot and it was money well-spent!UPDATE: I even tried making pasta and it turned out great and in under 7 minutes total. I just added enough pasta for a single serving, some pasta sauce out of a jar, 1 cup of water. I used the Manual setting for 3 minutes. After it was done, I quick released the steam and presto, perfect pasta! Amazing."
5.0 out of 5 stars,This is awesome! I thought it would be difficult to learn how to use but watched a few YouTube videos and it was easy peasy to use. The 6qt size is perfect for me. As an empty nester I’m only cooking for 2 but always want leftovers for packing lunches or freezing. I love that I can take meat from the freezer and cook it without needing to thaw it first! I have a FoodSaver vacuum sealing machine and have taken frozen meat that has been frozen for years. With the Instant Pot the meat has come out very tender with great flavor! Four year old pot roast from freezer was amazing! I have purchased additional accessories for Instant Pot as I use the Instant Pot because then I knew which accessories I needed/wanted.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"The first thing I learned is how easy and quick it is to make meals. The second thing is it makes a boatload of food, which is great if you're feeding a family. It's just me folks and I don't like eating the same thing for weeks on end. Yes, I can freeze the portions but there is only so much room in an apartment freezer. I am scaling down the seasoned recipes for 2 - 4 servings. The Instant Pot is a wonderful kitchen device. Get Barkeepers friend to keep the bowl clean. Get extra color-coded rings so when you cook fish your ring is different than other meals. CLEAN the lid after every use. Get the glass Instant Pot glass lid for when you want to sautee. This device has almost totally replaced all my pots and pans which saves space in an apartment. TONS of recipes online."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Now that I finally jumped on the instant pot trend ... I am glad I did. I did my first beef roast and was blown away about how quick it worked! Literally the meat was fork tender in less than a half hour. While I let the meat rest I then threw some small potatoes in and they were done in minutes. It comes with a handy reference card for cooking times of commonly used meats, beans, and veggies.I have two minor complaints. It does take a while to get up to pressure. So when your planning your meal build in some extra time. Also the directions are slightly lacking detail but it really doesn’t take much to use... you just want to be safe with the pressure. Last tip don’t release the pressure under a cupboard or light fixture over a kitchen counter for example as the steam is intense and it’s obviously hot and moist."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Instant Pot is all it is advertised to be.  Have enjoyed adding this to the meal preparations.  Stews, rice, brisket, whole chicken, curry... have tried them all and loved the results.  Hard to screw up anything, it's so easy.  Cleanup is supper easy with the removable pot.  One thing to note that I did not realize or really think about, the pressure cooking time call for only a 15 minutes for a particular recipe, but you have to plan on 10 minutes to pressure up and 15 minutes for it to de-pressure naturally.  So that rice time in the Instant Pot is actually 40 to 45 minutes (not 15)"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I learned about this appliance from one of the trainers at the gym I work out at. I was concerned about the higher temps and the impact on nutrients for the foods cooked this way. In essence, for most, because the cooking time is so much shorter, more nutrient content is preserved. We love how quickly we can cook yams, rice, and soups. Other than our microwave, it is now the most used kitchen appliance in our home."
1.0 out of 5 stars,"I do love many things about the instant pot.However, when my pot broke recently, I contacted their support team for a replacement since I was still well within the warranty period. Much to my surprise, they refused to honor the warranty claiming, with no evidence whatsoever, that it had been my actions that had led to the pot breaking. This simply wasn't true and when I told them that, for the third or fourth time, instead of sending me a new machine as they should have, they offered me a $10 discount on the base of the pot.So... purchase this product with care. It works well but it does tend to run into issues. And, when it does, it is very unlikely that the company will replace it as their warranty promises."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have used a stove top pressure cooker for years making stew which was very good.  Decided to get this as I was making a roast that in the past never got soft enough even after cooking for many hours on low heat.  BOught a few good books on AMazon and watched some great videos on YouTube. One from Butcher Box on making a frozen roast and another one from a fellow in N.Y. that has many many informative videos, the one on making the best roast ever.I had to cut the roast in half as it was to big for the pot.  Used ideas from the 2 guys and made each half in 70 minutes and each was melt in your mouth delicious.  The pot has a lot of great features. My problem is that it is so big and I am short that I had to have my husband sear the meat for me.  If the cord were longer I could have put it on a stand next to  the counter that was shorter.  I now have to be very careful as I had to use a step stool to stand on.I love this pot and have bought gadgets to use with it.  I will be doing most of my cooking in this instead of my oven and for the price it is worth every penny and a bargain.  Where could you buy an oven that could do so much as this pot."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Where have you been all my life? I had never used any type of pressure cooker but had so many friends recommend this I thought I’d give it a try. It literally took two uses to feel completely comfortable and confident using it. The ability to brown and sauté and pressure cook all in one pot is game changing. Without question it makes the easiest and best chicken stock and you end up with much more finished product than if you’d reduced on the stovetop for hours. Also excellent for chili, stews, Indian food, and just made a batch of pasta sauce from fresh tomatoes that is amazing. Honestly the biggest challenge you’ll have is finding a spot for it in your kitchen. Highly recommend for all seasons."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"Not the be-all end-all kitchen appliance but does do well what a pressure cooker is designed to do: cook cheap cuts of tough meat and make them palatable. It's allure comes from the ability to ""set and forget"" vs. a stovetop model that needs to be vigilantly monitored. If you peruse the abundance of online recipes you'll see that practically nobody uses the multiplicity of functions;  just manual pressure mode and how much time before venting it. Buy it when it's at a rock-bottom price and you'll feel OK that it's not the Messiah of the kitchen."
3.0 out of 5 stars,"I am a new user of InstantPot but I have learned a few basics that don't seem to be in the directions. First there is a 4 HOUR default when you pick ""Pressure Cook"". You have to count down with the ""minus"" sign to (say) 10 mins. for chicken in chunks. Then it takes 10 mins. to warm up, then it will begin the cook time. There is about a 10 or 15 min. cool down time unless you release the pressure. (I recommend tongs to do this as it spits a little). So ""instant"" isn't so instant. But if you want that tender pot roast in record time compared to a slow cooker or in the oven for hours, it is great. Also, be sure to use water or other liquid acording to directions which I don't if I am cooking an oven pot roast. I see raves about hard boiled eggs: I get mind done on the stove in less time than it takes the InstantPot to warm up. There is a great Lava Cake recipe on-line and that worked out deliciously. (Not the one in the recipe book which only makes one.) I like it, but it isn't the end all that the reviews say. Maybe I'll post agian after more than 4 usages."
1.0 out of 5 stars,"Bought this in June of this year, 2020. A little over a month later it died.On only the second meal I tried, it took forever to pressurize to start the timer.Finally the timer started and Poof, all the lights went out.Dead. A smell of burnt rubber permeated my kitchen and the uncooked food.Oh this is a goner. Nothing worked. I let it cool down, tried a different outlet and nothing. No lights. DEAD!The meal I was trying to cook was cold, smelled like rubber and ruined.After reading such high praise, I am so disappointed.Customer service so far has been useless.Gonna try going direct with Amazon.Hopefully I can get a refund for this piece of junk."
5.0 out of 5 stars,I love this thing.Cooks perfect Jasmine rice in less than 15min. (3min high pressure + ~8min natural pressure release)Perfect steamed potatoes (10min high pressure + ~10min natural pressure release).Get the OXO steel steamer with it.There's a saute mode so you can start frying things before switching to closed cooking. Lots of possibilities.
1.0 out of 5 stars,"BEWARE International orders!!! please note that the product description does not detail the voltage or plug/pin adapter specification of this product.  I ordered this product for use in the UK which is impossible, it would have been nice to have adequate description to avoid this wasted order and the hassle of having to return internationally."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I had a regular pressure cooker I used in the past, which was so difficult to use that I just gave up on it, so I was dubious about this pot but the fact you could make yogurt in it too , as well as the rave reviews here convinced me to get it.Wow..I would now say it's a kitchen must have for me, like my Vitamix. I am clumsy and hate struggling with things but even I could manage this lid and getting it off and on (you can't get it off until the pressure is too a certain level though).So far I have made gluten free chicken and dumplings, tortilla soup, stew, and just chicken thighs.Like another reviewer mentioned, for some reason the whole chicken or chicken with bones comes out better than the pure chicken meat by itself. You can't believe how quickly things cook and how tender the meat is. I'm looking forward to trying new recipes with this, making more old fashioned type comfort foods, and maybe even trying to make some persian dishes with this that usually take many hours to cook (like gorme sabzi, a stew of fried greens with dried lime and meat).Wonderful product, very happy I got it."
2.0 out of 5 stars,The variety of things you can cook with the Instant Pot is great. The durability of the product is not great. Mine just fell apart one day when I picked it up by the handle. The handle separated from the stainless steel casing. Also the bottom  black plastic piece disconnected from the stainless steel casing. It was dangling in my hand and the only thing holding it together were the electrical wires. I may have used it once a week at most for about a year and a half and have been gentle with it. I think it should have lasted much longer than that.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This was a gift to my spouse and WOW he loves it! This is so handy since we make a lot of beans, steam veggies, and make soups. This has become a permanent counter appliance."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've used pressure cookers my whole life and I love them. My daughters on the other hand are scared of them and I cannot get them to use them. When my younger was headed to her apartment life and dreaming on never ever eat college food again, I worried about how she was going to manage hard classes,  work, grocery shopping and cooking. The only solution was fast, batch cooking. I was intrigued by the Instant Pot reviews so I borrowed my neighbor's to try it out. We used it for a couple of weeks and loved it:  delicious dolmades (never made them before),  white and brown rice, soups and stews .... I loved the flavors and consistency, rice cooked better than in my rice cooker and it was much easier to clean than the heavy pressure cooker, plus the safety features made it ideal for beginner and distracted cooks. So, I found an offer in Amazon I couldn't pass and I got one for my kid. Fast forward to college life, the three roommates are using the instant pot and they  love it. As far as I know they have cooked rice, pasta, vegetables, beans and chickpeas (from scratch, without soaking=1 hour). They are learning to use it day by day, but the most important part is that because Instant Pot is very ""user friendly"" they are motivated to learn how to cook and feed themselves with healthy homemade meals on a tight budget. The only negative is the silicone ring smell, which I quite didn't figure out how to remove, although buying a second one for sweets would solve the issue. Conclussion: I love my pressure cookers and they are faster than the Instant Pot, but I'm watching Amazon offers to get one for myself."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I had a Cuisinart that does not hold as much, and the nonstick material was questionable.  The bigger size and the stainless steel of this Instant Pot make it well worth it.  I even convinced my household to get rid of our rice cooker, because this cooks rice really well.  Just pop the rice in for the 3 minute timer.  It takes about 8-10 minutes for the pressure to build up, and 8-10 minutes for the pressure to release, but it's still well worth it.  I'm actually using it right now to make an artichoke!  So easy.  I love the cute beeps when it closes so you know it is safely sealed and ready for the pressure."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"I use this mainly for the rather vast amounts of yogurt we use in our family. I have used it to try pressure cook one dish, which would certainly have been prepared were I better versed in PC's.What I want to call attention to is the awesome customer service I received from Neeru (the lead) and her colleague Amy. My base unit started to become flaky after about 9 months, and I figured it was my fault, so I went through several batches of milk attempting (at various temps and times) to make yogurt, only to realize that the base unit wasn't getting the milk hot enough.While the current web site is clumsy, I eventually got through to Neera by phone, and received prompt, courteous attention. I received a new unit within about 2 weeks, IN SPITE of the fact that I missed my warranty coverage by one day. So bottom line, in my experience, is that the complaints you read in these reviews about customer service have evidently been resolved."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is what I ordered but got an older version- the 6 in 1.That said, after trying one out for myself,  I bought one for each of my daughters and daughter's in laws.Highly impressed with the ease of use and how quickly it heats up and begins coming on its own.A flavorful low temp cooked and steamed beef stew in under 3 hours.The stainless removable insert wiped clean with a paper towel,  even after flooring and braising the meat first.  Amazing!  The bottom of the cooking pot insert is made of a very thick stainless steel,  so gives a uniform and consistent  heating across the bottom.I made cheesy ham and potato soup in 10 minutes -  minus the chopping time of the potatoes and ham of course. Tasted like it had simmered all day. Rich flavor were infused throughout.So much easier and more versatile than a stove top pressure cooker that stays cool to the touch on the outside. At is a 3 temp adjustable slow cooker -  with or without steam; a pressure cooker, searing pot, rice cooker; vegetable and crab steamer;  yogurt maker; milk pasteurizer; and I read that the 7 in 1 could also be used as a canner since it's psi is higher than the 6 in 1. . Which is why I had ordered that one in particular.In my 1st week,  I cooked pork ribs (from frozen state)  to the point of falling off the bone in less than 25 minutes on steam. I added sauce right at the end and let it finish with the steam vent opened.  Yummy!Last night I cooked rice in 10 minutes start to finish, set it aside in a lidded casserole while I quickly seared 4 chicken breasts,  then put lid on and steamed them on medium. In 10 minutes they were fork tender.  I then put the chicken on top of the rice in the casserole dish,  covered the chicken  with homemade cherry bbq sauce and broiled it for 5 minutes . Paired with a toss salad, it was the perfect,  delicious,  healthy dinner!The daughters and in-laws love theirs as well, making chicken stock in 10 minutes,  bbq pulled pork for sandwiches, split pea and ham soup from scratch in record time. . No more soaking dried beans overnight. .This has become a permanent piece on the kitchen counter!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Like seriously, you still cook with fire? Or those stove that tries to look like the fire one but missing the most important thing, which is to heat up fast?I won't add anymore to pressure cooking. Enough people cover it.I cooked a proper Korea soup noodle bowl called Kimchi kalguksu under 20 mins flat from the point I started heating COLD water. You try that on a conventional stove good luck with boiling 1.5L of water under 5 mins.The pressure cooking? Nah, you don't know what pressure cooking is if you don't own instant pot. Go get a cheap one and blow up the house then come back here and get something designed by a proper engineer with actual fail-safe devices."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I am not a newbie to pressure cooking and canning.  I had a similar 6 qt smart cooker from a different brand prior to buying this Instant Pot, and I have many years of pressure canning experience with a large dumb canner.  I have used the Instant Pot Duo Plus for pressure cooking meat, potatoes and vegan chili.  It has worked well each time though invariably needs some additional pressure time.  The seals are excellent compared to my past smart cooker.  The saute setting did a very nice job browning some beef for a ""stew"".  I have not used the yogurt function I will be quite sensitive to temperature accuracy as my last smart cooker missed the mark by a seriously unsafe amount.  I would NOT use this as a pressure canner.  There is not enough instrumentation to make safe cooking times.  The build quality is great, it is quiet and does what it is told, to this point.  I am very pleased."
1.0 out of 5 stars,"Something was wrong with my instant pot the very first time I used it. I cook some rice and it burned. Whatever I cooked and left to keep warm would burn. After like a dozen time cooking and burning my food, it stopped working altogether. Try calling the company but was on hold for longer than my break. Email them and told them what happened and their reply was to use oil. My pot doesn't work. Email them back that it doesn't work and have not heard from them since. Terrible customer service, terrible product."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought this thing as a christmas present for my mother, and she absolutely loves it. I was with her when she used it for the first time and there were a few things that stood out to me.The build quality is fantastic. I own a different pressure cooker myself, and I can say that the components of MY pressure cooker are much flimsier compared to the components of THIS pressure cooker. The most obvious one is the pot insert that comes out of the cooker. (The thing that the good actually goes in). If you haven't used  a pressure cooker before, just think of this part as the liner that the food actually sits in. In this pot, the liner is THICK, STURDY, and BEAUTIFUL STAINLESS STEEL. The same cannot be said for the liner of many other pressure cookers including my own.Second, this thing looks great and it's easy to use. I rest easy knowing that I picked the right one for my mom. Some of these cookers are just impossible to figure out, but this thing is INTUITIVE. And like I said, it looks GREAT sitting right on your counter top."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"What a fantastic electric cooker!!!First let me say,  I've used and owned a wide variety of pressure cookers (PC's) over the past 40+ years from the lowly Presto, a Fagor, All American canner and all the way up to the Mercedes of PC's the wonderful Kuhn Rikon Duomatic in a 5 qt and a 12 qt models.  I have owned 8 qt. electric PC's also but after they died young with flaked off and nasty teflon coated interiors that I was constantly replacing I swore I would NEVER buy another electric PC!  NEVER!  Well, a friend was convinced I didn't know what I was missing from not owning an Instant Pot with their s/s interior pot.  Since I have spent a truck load of money on these PC's over the years I could not believe this cooker could be any better than all the others.  Boy was I wrong!The iPot is multi-functional, predictable and forgettable until you hear the beep!  I bought the 8 qt. because my two best PC's are 5 and 12 quarts.  The 5 being almost too small for two people and the 12 quart way too big for weeknight meals for two people so what I wanted was an 8 qt size and when I saw the introduction of the 8 qt. I leaped for it.  I have started making foods in this cooker I never even tried again after my first few unpleasant experiences in trying to cook them in the stove top models; i.e., rice, beans, veggies and  boiled EGGS for breakfast!  Who would have ever thought it could be so easy and CONSISTENT every single time and even produce boiled eggs that my husband likes in ONE MINUTE - soft and runny - just how he loves them every single time I make them.  I've also endeavored to learn to cook more meals in the iPot because I've learned that I can rely on the eventual outcome.  I must admit I've only used the slow cooking setting once.  I'm not too great at planning ahead so my go to first method of cooking is the pressure setting.  I've enjoyed the sauteed setting and the ability to do almost every step right in the PC because of the big s/s pan.  I've been rethinking the cooking process so I can cook the pasta, drain, keep warm and build the rest of the sauce/ingredients and return the pasta to the sauce for a one pot meal.  What a lovely helpmate this iPot has become. Less work, less clean up when the meal is finished and a perfect outcome.  Hooray!I'm thrilled with this purchase and I hope this countertop miracle worker will keep on puffing and cooking those meals for years to come!  So glad I was one of the first people to buy the 8 qt, even if I did pay more money for it (LOL) than what it is selling for now!"

After the initial setup and run, Had Turkey chili made my family was happy. Absolutely no regrets."

Had to return my first Instapot too but no hassle with BB&B .Now it won’t submit without a star rating. No star. Doesn’t work!!!!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"So far I am very happy with this pot.  Very easy to use, very good, detailed instruction book.  Have found answers to all of my questions, so far, in this manual. Glad I finally made the purchase.  Love the saute feature so I don’t have to get another pan dirty.  Haven’t used the slow cook feature yet, but I’m sure it will work well as every other feature has so far.  I am single so this pot is perfect for me to make a meal plus a couple extra servings to freeze or have another day.  Should be great for a 2-3 person family.Update 4/16/18:  not impressed with the slow cooker feature at all.  Low barely has the food warm after 2-1/2 hours.  Made chili using hi and my ip is not taking the temp to the 210 degrees the book states.  Otherwise, still love the cooker.  Saute is so convenient before pressure cooking."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"When my husband gave me this as a Christmas gift, i thought...""hmm nice, but i already have two stove top pressure cookers that I really like, so kind of a waist"".  Well i smiled graciously, and then thought I can't just send it back, i've got to give it a try first. Well, OMG.. this has truly revolutionized my time in the kitchen.  I don't have to stare at the pressure cooker to see when the pressure valve has popped up... I don't have to monitor the pot while under pressure to make sure the temp isn't too low or high... This machine is literally a put it in, turn it on, and leave it alone.  I find myself using it all of the time, like each day.  I cook complete meals in it, where with my stove top i just cooked up big batches of beans to later use in recipes.  I simply love the ease and convenience of this pot.Pros... everything from timer mode, to being able to sauté in pot before adding other ingredients, to turn it on and walk away.  I love that the inner pot is stainless steel as that is important to my cooking.Cons... my stove top cookers are 8 and 10 quart ... this is a 6 quart.  i wish it were bigger. Good for a meal a perhaps left overs for my family, but not big batch cooking.Tips:  Get an extra inner pot so that if you are finished cooking one thing, you can immediately put the next pot in.  This has been my way of doing big batch cooking.  I prepare both pots at the same time, and just cook one after the other.  Also get the additional glass lid, great for steaming and storage.  I also got a steamer insert basket that worked great once i took the handles off.  http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007SPKR8U?psc=1&redirect=true&ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o09_s00Comparison to the 6 in one Instant.  They are very similar, but the 6-1 model i received, first of all didn't work, but secondly had i had a working model, the lid isn't the same.  The inside cover that protects the pop up valve is much smaller. Perhaps still a great pot, but for a bit extra i recommend the 7-1."

Tons of recipes and general How-To's for this wonder.  Having said that, I'd say that if I'd had any clue about how many things can be made in this, I'd have opted for the 6 Qt.  What I didn't realize is that I'd want to have leftovers to have again for next day lunch OR to freeze.  Also, I didn't know you can Reheat food in the Instant Pot, among many other things I'd never thought of.  No wonder it's so popular!!!  I will be buying a 6 Qt. to use, as well as my 3 Qt.  Great for Meal Prepping Days."
2.0 out of 5 stars,Owned this for 11 months.  Will not come up to pressure with anything but water in it.  I have been back and forth with customer support for a month now.  They sent me a new sealing ring to test.  Same issues.  Then they reply that since it is not leaking steam that the unit is fine.  Well it wasn't leaking steam to begin with and it is still not working right (trying to simply cook spaghetti sauce).We'll see how it goes with getting a replacement but blaming the thickness of the liquid you are cooking is poor.  It's a pressure cooker right?
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This Instant Pot is easy to use and recipes are easy to follow. I made 2-3lb pieces of corned beef Sunday in 1 hr and 40 mins! I than reserved 2 cups of the juices from the corned beef and added peeled and washed russet potatoes, peeled carrots and a quartered cabbage head. The veggies were fork tender in 7 mins. I did another pot of the same veggies and had 2 corned beef dinners cooked in a couple of hours! We delivered one meal to our son and daughter-in-law who just got home with their new baby boy and of course, didn’t have time to cook anything! They raves about the meal and were so thankful!I can’t wait to play around with other recipes and foods! What fun that this pot can cook so many different ways!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I was so afraid of this pressure cooker because everyone was talking about it but I am not the best person in the kitchen. It sat in my pantry for two months like a little monster. I’ve finally decided I’m doing this because I am trying to learn as much as I can about the plant protocol diet and removing lectins from my diet as much as possible. I was a little confused so I called my daughter-in-law and did a FaceTime.  I put a cubed sweet potato at the bottom then the trivet, and then added a chicken. What would normally have taken me two hours took me 37 minutes 32 in the cooker and then I took it out for five minutes and put it in the oven to get outside a little crunchier. My life is changed forever. The other night I made a couple of artichokes and they came out perfect. So now I’m looking for good recipes and plan on using it often because I don’t have time To spend two or three hours in the kitchen, especially with my back hurting if I stand too long. I’m thrilled and excited to for this product I never will look at it the same. The safety features are great because that was my huge fear is that I would burn myself up. That’s not going to happen if you just follow the directions, relax and enjoy. This is the best choice for people who don’t have a lot of time and still want healthy eating."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Starting using this item about a month after I got it used maybe 15 times when it started leaking from the top of the lid, called assurance warranty and was advised that product was still under manufactures warranty called them, they requested i send pictures and video of product malfunctioning did everything they asked for. They sent me a replacement base ? when they had them back in stock they were on back order. The product issue was with LID so back to waiting to see what they will do disappointed this company will run a person around in circles these are not inexpensive and had i known i would be having this problem I would just have bought a new one. I missed my chance to get another one will I could get a deal."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"I've had the Instant Pot Duo for a couple of months now and overall I'm happy with how the unit has worked. I've tried quite a few recipes and the Instant Pot delivers just as good, if not better, that my Fagor pressure cooker. I've invested in the ceramic non-stick insert as my steel cut oatmeal tended to stick to the stainless steel insert. The controls are clear and pretty easy to use (look in my cons for the one issue that I have with the controls):Pros: if cooking anything that requires low and slow cooking, the Instant Pot will drastically cut the time. Potatoes, greens, oatmeal, tougher cuts of meat all come out in a fraction of the normal cooking time due to the pressurized cooking. Some recipes will need adjustment and a little trial and error, but that's normal for cooking in a new tool.Cons: The delay cooking works in a countdown fashion, rather than on time fashion. To explain, if it's 8pm and I want my food to start at 5am I will have to set the delay for 9 hours. Takes a little math at times, and that's a bit of a pain, but I've seen this before in my Genius Cooker.Other con, the popularity of the unit has caused a huge backlog in customer support. I have a support ticket that I put in on 2/23 that has yet to receive a response in two weeks. Do yourself the favor and pay for the extended warranty, since when this breaks you may have a long time to wait for a replacement."
3.0 out of 5 stars,"The pressure cooker function is much nicer than the traditional, noisy pressure cooker. Pleasantly surprised when it alarmed & shut off cooking when it sensed not enough liquid to prevent burning - saved my meal. Would not recommend pressure cooking meat: came out very tough. Kind of a pain to clean, remembering the little bits to take apart & wash separately. Hope they can be purchased separately when they go missing, which little bits eventually do."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I chose the Instant Pot pressure cooker because of the stainless steel insert. I generally avoid non-stick surfaces, choosing an iron skillet for most of my frying needs, and I did not want a pressure cooker with a non-stick surface. This Instant Pot cooker is a bit more expensive than many of the options with non-stick pots, but I think it's worth it. I am extremely impressed by the quality of the pot included. Most rice cookers and that sort of device have very thin pots which commonly leads to burning of food. This pot has a double walled base such as you would find on an expensive stove top cooking pot.I have only made three things in the pot, so I cannot speak to the longevity of the cooker. However, I can say that the pot works exactly as you would hope that it does. First I made beef stew according to a recipe I found online. The meat was browned in the pot with the lid off and then other ingredients added and the entire dish then pressure cooked. It did a fine job, and the seemingly ubiquitous step of removing the meat and adding liquid to deglaze the pot caused all the food to be stirred off the bottom and the flavor included in the dish. Cleanup was a breeze. Then I made stew, using a very similar process. First the meat was browned in the pot, removed, and liquid added to deglaze. Then the remaining ingredients were added back and pressure cooked. Black beans which had only been soaked for an hour were cooked to tender, along with the meat, in 30 minutes on the ""Beans and Soup"" setting. Finally I cooked garbanzo beans for hummus. Those had soaked overnight and rinsed, and the same ""beans and soup"" setting used to cook. I put the rack in and placed the soaked beans in a steamer insert. They were tender and made great hummus after only 30 minutes of pressure cooking. (Note: soaked beans should not take as long as unsoaked beans, but I wanted them very soft for hummus)Note that getting up to pressure takes 12-15 minutes, depending on how much water and other ingredients are in the pot. cooking time is on top of that.The device makes virtually no noise unless you have it set to ""steam"" (the weight is turned one way for steaming and the other way for pressure).I never scrubbed the pot after any of these meals, although with the smooth stainless steel, you certainly could do so without destroying the surface.I would definitely recommend this pot if you're considering an electronic pressure cooker. Staying away from non-stick and getting the better quality insert pot is, in my opinion, worth the extra $30 over other options."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love, love, love this product. My co-worker raved every afternoon about she had dinner on the table while she bet I was still cooking. We are teachers and we are always getting home later than we want to. I ordered this over the summer convinced I would return, I have literally used every week since at least 4 nights a week. I have pinned future recipes on Pinterest. My family’s favorite has been the barbecue pulled chicken, yet I didn’t pull anything. I used boneless chicken with barbecue sauce, put in instant pot and 20 minutes later; just check out the picture. I just got a second liner today so I can do main dish anything extra in the same cooking 45 minutes. Wish I could post more pictures!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Works fantastically.I have so far tried the pressure cooker and the slow cooker options with very good results.I am a long term pressure cooker user and own 3 other standard pot style pressure cookers, this is my first electric. I must say it is so very quiet when it's pressurized. You can barely hear it unlike the old fashioned models.My one and only complaint is the rubber seal is susceptible to absorbing smells. After the first use, after it was washed, we started to notice a strange smell in the kitchen and it took a few days before we figured out where the smell was coming from. I found the obnoxious aroma coming from the lid. I figured it was perhaps splatter in the vent area that perhaps didn't get cleaned well enough. After washing the lid again, I realized the smell was actually coming from the rubber seal.  I washed the seal in warm soapy water several times, even soaked it for a bit...it's better but still not great. I now store the seal in a gallon zip lock bag when not in use. It doesn't seem to be a problem during cooking, as I cannot smell that funk during that time. I even tried pressure cooking some water w/ lemon and herbs to try to get a better smell permeated into the rubber, but no luck. Hopefully it will go away in time."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I hemmed and hawed about getting yet another kitchen gadget (I already own a steamer - albeit on its last legs, a bread maker, and three slow cookers), but I do weekly meal prep and was looking for something to make large volume cooking a bit easier and more efficient.I'm so glad I bought the instant pot, and it has come in even more handy than I imagined it would. In particular, I'm a huge fan of doing hard cooked eggs in it for a number of reasons. First, I live in a drought-prone area and I love that it uses SO much less water than boiling. Second, the eggs come out cooked to perfection every time. Third, they peel like a dream.I've also used it to heat up soup from frozen in about 20 minutes, make crack-free cheesecake, cook tough items like barley and dry beans, and homemade yogurt. I've been making my own yogurt for several years now and my old method was fairly straightforward but time intensive. I used to heat up mason jars full of milk in the microwave (took about 20 minutes with constant stirring and checking temperature), let it cool to 110F, inoculate with starter, and incubate in the oven with the light on for 8 or so hours. However, this process rendered my oven unusable for the better part of a day which is problematic while doing meal prep! Now, I put the jars of milk in the instant pot, steam for 1 minute to scald, allow to cool, and use the yogurt function to incubate at the correct temperature for 8 hours.I feel like I still have so much to explore with the instant pot, but I'm already in love. Of course, I'm sure similar results can be obtained using a traditional stovetop pressure cooker, but I'm pleased with the set and forget aspect and the ability to free up space on my normally crowded stovetop.Overall, this was worth every penny of the $100 I spent on it. I hope it lasts me a very long time!"
2.0 out of 5 stars,"After 2 years of my instant pot, I'm back to normal stove top cooking again. Once you add the up time it takes to pressurize and naturally release, it doesn't really save me any time. And quick release is just an unpleasant experience all around! Easier to just skip the instant pot and do it the old fashioned way. Tastes better, too. The only exception is hard boiled eggs. IP does it very well. That's all I use it for now."
1.0 out of 5 stars,"While I followed instructions and ran a successful test, I waited to use it until I had people with experience on hand. Three of my friends, all of whom own the same model and swear by it, tried to get it to work to no avail. It sautéed but wouldn't lock down properly and the steamer spigot was not in the right position and we couldn't coax it into the right position. Luckily, someone had a 1949 pressure cooker that worked like a charm. This all happened last weekend (June 27) and I'm now REALLY disappointed to see that I'm past the window for returns!!! I had no idea there was such a thing. THIS IS NOT GOOD!!! THE PRODUCT IS DEFECTIVE!!!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Ok ok ok I know you have read a lot about the Instapot and are wondering if you should join the cult. You can do just about anything on it with a regular stovetop pot. It may be a little over hyped but when I got mine, I too became one of the Instapot heads. It changed me from 2-day a week cooking to daily cooking. You can become one too.Seriously, I go to the grocery store, grab whatever meats are on sale, and then Google recipes with the meat it is + Instapot. My skill in cooking has increased tremendously with this g izmo.The only gripe I have is size. It's huge and takes up a lot of space."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"This product matches the description on the website, so I am satisfied from this perspective. The only thing that has caused some inconvenience so far is that the printed user's manual enclosed in the package does not tell how to adjust non-pressure cooking temperatures, and it was not very intuitive to figure out -- all the ways I tried turned out to adjust the time not temperature, making me almost want to call customer service. The way I finally figured it out is by searching the internet for the FULL user's manual. I suggest the printed user's manual add this piece of instruction in, and let the customers know that a FULL user's manual is available on the manufacturer's website.By the way, their customer service hotline is not very helpful for instant help, because it is only Mon- Thur before 16:00, which is not the peak time of using the pressure cooker."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"I live by myself and I like to prepare food enough for 3-4 meals when I cook. I got this (3 qt) instead of the bigger size thinking it would be enough just for one. It’s great for most of the dishes like chicken/mince with rice but if I chop up many vegetables (e.g. for a soup), it fills up pretty quickly and it doesn’t take 4 meals. Other than that, it’s great and versatile as usual."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Although I'm by myself now this pot came up on Amazon at a smoking deal.  I'd been toying with the idea of getting one.  My daughter has a friend who swears by the Instant Pot.  So I bought this kind of on the spur of the moment.  I love it!  There is a little bit of a learning curve but not bad.  I've been using it about 2-3 times a week and I'm pleased with everything I use it for.  I'm older so lifting around the inner liner of a slow cooker is getting harder and harder.  Cleaning the liner of the Instant Pot is a snap.  If I use a recipe that serves 4 I have it to eat that day, a couple of days down the line and two servings to freeze.  I'm very pleased with this purchase.  As far as cookbooks are concerned, I just went online.  There are literally hundreds of recipes from blogs where people actually cook and can give you good, solid advice for using the device."
2.0 out of 5 stars,"I got this product about 3 years ago. I was hoping to replace a few kitchen products- for me it was not a sufficient slow cooker. But I did appreciate the pressure cooker feature.Anyway, all was fine, I used it a few times a month, until last week it stopped working for no reason at all. Can’t figure out what happened. Just won’t turn on. So yes I got a few years use out of it but for a product that I spent 150 on I am very disappointed."
1.0 out of 5 stars,"The product as such has great features. But beware, the quality standard and customer service is not that great. I purchased this in November 2017 and it worked great for about 51/2 months. I loved the features and used it extensively every day. Then it just died. Since it was over 30 days, Amazon customer care directed me to the manufacturer. Instantpot customer care asked me for a lot of details and pictures of the dead pot before they stated they were going to replace the bottom piece (without the cord and inner pot) of another version (still compatible with the existing cord and inner pot) in about 10 business days. Its over 3 weeks and I haven't received any. If you are heavily depending on this pot for your daily cooking, you might want to keep a back up as the customer care for Instapot is really really really slow and also, a lot of my friends and acquaintance had the same issue of a dead / non working pot either under warranty or out of warranty. If you are having issue under warranty, albeit slow, they may do some shoddy replacement but if you are out of warranty(they give one year) as is the case for most users I know, you are forced to buy another. So if you are buying this product, be aware that the quality is not really that great and you are better off buying extended warranty. That being said, it is Amazon customer care that was really helpful with my issue. Can't say much about Instant pot customer care though."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"Omg I love this thing SO much!! I can cook, but I’m lazy and hate watching food. This reduces cook times on so many things drastically (like goodbye overnight soaking beans then cooking for hours, try more like 20-30 min and you’re done. Also 1 minute quinoa! ). You can just press a button, walk away when done, and then you got food! It’s also amazing hard to mess up a dish using this thing. My only complaint is it came without its steam catcher, I use it without though. Also if you don’t clean the lid well after a full pot of something the plastic seal can hold color or order. All In all though-life changing! I’ve been going soup and chilli crazy. It’s going to be a fun fall/winter. Everyone should have one of these, seriously, just forget stove top cooking! It’s pointless compared to this thing. This size is good for a single person or a family of two if you went to make food that will last a few days at least. If you have a bigger family and want to cook large amounts that will last you all a few days do the 8 or 10 quart size."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love, love ,love my Instant pot! I feel so much safer with it than the stove top variety. Read the instructions, plan ahead, and get started! The sky is the limit! eggs, Baked potatoes, cheese cake.....yes, cheese cake!!! I love that you can pre-saute in the pot and not have to mess up another pan. It has pre-programed settings so that you don't have to guess about time.When the stainless steel inner pot starts to look ""loved"" just clean it with Cameo aluminun/stainless steel cleaner and it will look good as new! The silicon ring kind of takes on the smell of what you cooked ....oh well, I don't care.There are all kinds of accessories you can get! A silicon lid for refrigerating, pans for cheese cake, racks for steaming, and the list goes on!Lots of cookbooks. Lots of Pinterest recipes. You won't go without!I bought 2 for myself and 1 for each of my awesome children...4, plus 1 for my daughter in love.Hope that this is helpful. And, yes, I would purchase again!"

Boiled eggs take 7 minutes and peel incredibly easy!  Since then I've been making meals in my Instant Pot at least 5 out of seven days a week and amazing soups!  Popcorn is yummy and so easy to fix!  So glad I purchased it!  When cleaning the Instant Pot I leave my lid upside down and do not leave it sealed as it protects the seal and does not wear out as quickly!  Also consider getting the non-stick inner pot as well!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I had friends asking for recipes for their Instant Pot that they received for Christmas.  I must admit i had no idea what they were talking about nor did i bother to google it.  Amazon Prime Day was the first time i saw exactly what the excitement was about.  I received it and some useful accessories i purchased separately.  First time use was to boil/steam eggs.  I couldnt wait to try this and it seemed easy enough.  They came out PERFECT!  2nd use was egg cups for breakfast.  These were absolutely delish!  I USED to make these in my oven with muffin tins.  Boy was this WAY easier and faster!  I am truly impressed and now that i have my cookbook (received today) Im already planning meals and making a grocery list! ""Say hello to my little friend!""  😁"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I cook for me, whole food plant based.  My husband cooks for himself.  So, just occasionally I like to NOT use my 6 quart instant pot and use this little gem instead. I was one of those people that didn't like the pressure cookers of old, the ones that rocked around on the stove? It had to be something for me to even buy one. This baby is quiet.  Have a question? The manual is great and if you still have questions, ask a group on Facebook. I belong to several.  Like I said, just the best. Don't want to pressure cook?  Saute, slow cook and yes even make yogurt.  Yogurt is next on my list.This is the Cadillac of Instant Pots Pressure Cookers."

Slather with my sauce in  foiled pan and under broiler. That’s 3 racks of ribs!  Good sirloin cubes sautéed, onion then make gravy and serve on riceI make perfect custards every week. I also make yogurt twice a month, saving 2-3 Tb for the next time. For making veggies for a group I give the beans under-steaming then before serving micro to good and hot 8min. Easy baked potatoes same way. They get good and hot in the oven.I could go on in. I use my Instant Pot."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"So happy I purchased the bigger model. It’s the perfect size for our family because we like to eat a lot lol So easy to use! This was my first experience with any pressure cooker and we love it! So fast and very easy to use..I cooked spaghetti in the instant pot and it’s the only way I will ever cook spaghetti again! You brown your veggies and meat all in the IP,add uncooked noodles,your favorite marinara sauce,a can of diced tomatoes and about 3/4 bottle of water all together,set timer for 8 minutes and WOW!!! The noodles soaked up the flavor of all the goodies. All in one pot.. couldn’t be easier or tastier..It was fabulous! Have also “boiled” eggs with quickness. Looking forward to many more delicious meals for years to come. Highly recommend for people like me...short on time,busy folk who like healthy,fast and easy suppers whipped up in no time. Spend more time with the family,not in the kitchen,but still that homemade flavor!"

5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have had my Instant Pot for 3 years. I've used it almost daily....for 3 years! I'm not exaggerating!  I'm looking at the new one that air fries, dehydrates etc.  I purchased my IP because I work fulltime & sitting down & enjoying a nourishing meal each night is important to me & I love cooking my own meals. I refuse to use a microwave or eat takeout food.  I prepare enough for leftovers & I take a healthy lunch to work.  I've saved so much money its unbelievable!  I decided to take the time to write this review because of my very positive experience with this product. 😊"
5.0 out of 5 stars,I had been in the market for a while for an air fryer and stumbled upon this lid. It is amazing! Easy to use and takes up less space than if I got another appliance. It just sit right on top of the instant pot and does it thing.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love this for pressure cooking and regular cooking.  I have a stove top pressure cooker, which I like, but I love this one.  This is much more convenient to use since it has a timer on it and I don't have to sit and watch it while it is cooking.  I have replaced my rice cooker with this because the rice turns out even better in the pressure cooker.  I've noticed that when cooking rice, I do have to use a little less water than normal, otherwise, the rice is too soggy.  But, the rice turns out perfect once you get the hang of it.  I'm used to using a stove top pressure cooker and really don't use any special cookbooks to cook in this.  I like to be able to just throw a frozen piece of meat in the cooker and have a roast or something else cooked in a shorter time frame.  If the meat is frozen, just make sure you increase the time manually instead of using the pre-programmed setting or your food will not be done.  If you've been on the fence about getting a pressure cooker due to all of the horror stories of them exploding, if they did explode it is because they were not venting properly.  As long as you make sure the vent is venting correctly and the lid is on securely, you have nothing to worry about.  I purchased the stainless steel version and I also purchased a second stainless steel pot, because I use this a lot.  The stainless steel is very easy to clean and usually just soaking it in some hot, soapy water does the trick.  I use a non-scratching scrubber and some bar keeper's friend if there is some tough residue that just doesn't want to come out easily.  Haven't had any problems with it yet and have been using it for a while.  You might want to consider getting some of the Instant pot accessories like the glass lid, extra stainless steel pot, the silicone pot mini mitts, and an extra silicone gasket.  The silicone gasket tends to hold the odors of the food that you cooked, so I take mine out after using it and soak it to get rid of the odors and have the spare to cook in the pot again without having to wait."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I was going to give this as a gift to my daughter but after reading all the positive reviews I decided to keep it myself. But while I was reading the manual and recipes that came with the unit, I wasn't so sure I made the right decision. I will be the first to say they are poorly written and not fun to read. I then went online and started searching for recipes for the Instant Pot and saw the fun and incredible things that can be done with it.I am very familiar with pressure canning. This is something completely different. Pressure canning requires 30-90 minutes to pressure seal a jar and make it safe to store. The instant Pot is measured in a lot less time for cooking an item. White rice in 8 minutes? ( By the way, no one will walk by and lift the lid to see whats cooking...one of my pet peeves when I'm cooking rice.)Everyone on the reviews mentions a ""learning curve"". They are very correct, but they are fun lessons and easy to catch on.If you are into making bone broth, this is the perfect tool. Instead of simmering the bones for 12-36 hours on the stove, the Instant Pot does it in 2-3 hours for the most nutritious bone broth. Just pack the Instant pot to the fill line with chicken, beef or any bones (pre cooked or fresh) and fill to the same line with water and a tablespoon of apple cider vinegar. Set on high pressure for 2-3 hours. Very good for healing broken bones or any joint pain.I now feel good about ordering another one to give to my daughter."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is for all practical purposes an automatic pressure cooker. It works very well as that. It comes up to pressure in just minutes, and it is almost completely silent. It does not hiss and burp and sizzle like a conventional pressure cooker does. You don't have to monitor and adjust the heat to keep it from over heating, it is all automatic. Push the button and walk away. Mine is a perfect size (six quart) and convenient and fast to use. The rice and bean and etc. buttons are very convenient.It does not seem to make a very good slow cooker as its high temp for slow cooking seems to be the equivalent of ""keep warm"" for a traditional crock pot. It's slow cooker mode just doesn't get hot enough, so I still use my crock pot if I want something to simmer all day or night."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I am so happy with this Instant Pot. I have used it only for the slow cooker so far but it has gotten so much use so far. I love that I can throw my chicken and all my veggies in and let it cook for however long I want. I’ve been making bone broth, soups and anything that pops into my head. I am on a super restricted diet due to health issues and every meal has to be made fresh....no leftovers at all....so this comes in handy and saves me so much time. Plus it is super easy to use and clean. I have other crock pots but this size is perfect and it’s so easy to clean. I set the desired cooking time and then when it’s done cooking it keeps it warm."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This thing cooks incredible ribs. Just pull the membrane back on the ribs, chop it up, toss it in the pressure cooker for 25-30 mins and then put some of that BBQ sauce on it, shove it in the oven and BROIL it for 2 mins or so on each side (to caramelize, it's already falling off the bone from the pressure cooker).  Done.  You've now just made super fast ribs that's better than what most average people can make.Besides ribs, this thing has a host of easy to use functions like rice, beans, and you can even open the lid to sauteeing (which is what I do if I want to make some spaghetti sauce -- I would use the pot to saute up some onions, ground beef, bell peppers, mushrooms, and then dump in that good ol' Ragu/Prego sauce, season it to taste...and voila).There's a lot more safety features and cool mechanisms with this thing so if safety is a concern, I wouldn't fret.One thing to take note of, I recommend getting another of the silicone rubber sealant that goes on the inside of the pressure cooker lid (allows for sealing, so that the thing can pressurize properly).  It's sold here on Amazon, and also from the Instant Pot manufacturing site.  This sealant tends to develop a certain odor after awhile, and no matter how much I clean it, it's hard to get rid of.  I recommend stashing one or two extras and using those for specific groupings of food (e.g. one sealant for meats, another for soups, etc)...but then again, that's only if you're OCD like me.  I imagine most people wouldn't care because the food results you get out of this thing is sublime."
2.0 out of 5 stars,"I'll admit I'm just slow to jump on trends... but I DO NOT understand all of the hype related to this piece of kitchen equipment... IT'S NOT INSTANT! You pressurize food for 8 minutes.. then it takes another 10-40 minutes to ""release""??? You can achieve the exact same results (I've actually done better).. by defrosting your meats in the microwave (while preheating the oven when needed) and cooking at normal temp... I just find this to be a tremendous waste of time. Glad i got it during a decent sale, but if anyone's interested in buying one.. let me know. It took me too long to figure out how to use it now it's beyond the return window. Another one for the Kitchen Graveyard. And just to be fair.. I did have a couple of recipes meet my expectations.. just not enough for me to add this to the other kitchen equipment that will get countertop space.  I'm giving 2 stars because the machine was in proper condition and the shipping was excellent (not a Prime member).  However, the usefulness, end results and ease of use are not winners for me."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"We have used the Instant Pot DUO60 (6-Quart) for about a year. We love it! You can cook delicious meals in minutes (seriously 15-30 minutes). It saves time and electricity, compared to using the oven or cooktop and the meals are more delicious. Clean up is easy too, just wash the stainless steel inner pot and the lid, wipe down the rest and your done.We bought this 8-Quart, which is the same as our 6-Quart, because when we have guests we needed to make more food and sometimes we cook two different dishes at the same time using both Instant Pots. I like to eat a whole lot more than I like to cook, and I couldn't be happier with the Instant Pots."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Want to get your college kids and your busy parents the perfect gift?! The Instapot is IT! Time saving, ease of use, frozen chicken and main courses from prep to serve in less than 45 minutes-and TASTY TOO! I have cooked since I was 6 and am quite a few years older now. I used to have every implement known to the cooking world, and after cooking with the Instapot, I cannot tell you, how impressed I am. It does steel cut Quaker oats in less than 30 minutes, one of the healthiest foods you can eat. Usually this takes 6-8hours in a crock pot. Wonderful. Great gift, even for yourself!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have been looking to get this for over a year but kept finding excuses to save money. One night I was cooking brown rice and I realized I was tired to wait so long just to cook rice. I looked at getting a rice cooker but after reading many comments, it sounded like instant pot is as good as most rice cookers and can do a lot more so I finally bought it. The first thing I cooked was basmati rice and not only was it fast, it was the best basmati rice I tasted outside a Chinese restaurant! I then used it to make some egg bites for a healthy breakfast and again great success.The device looks great, it's easy to use and store. I cannot wait to try the over functions."
5.0 out of 5 stars,This is my second instant pot. I originally bought the 8 quart and it's too large for the counter or even handy tuck away storage even though I very often cook large batches and freeze.  This mini (3 quart) is nice for on the counter and perfect for a dinner for 2. My favorite part is I really like the control panel selection.  I have not used the yogurt setting yet but I'm hoping it will hold many of my fermented beans and legumes at a steady low temp for 24 hours which I have seen on you tube but will have to verify it in my own kitchen. Last night I concocted a great black bean turkey chili and the settings were easy to use and it turned out perfect. Excellent size for  tuck-away or counter top.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have only had my Instapot for about a week, yet I have cooked every dinner and most lunches with it.This is simply incredible. It is the next best thing in my kitchen to my SINK!I have experimented with lots of recipes: chicken, beef, bison, squash. All of them have come back DELISH!Here are some quick and dirty recipes:Chicken and Rice- a frozen (preferrably ORGANIC) packet of chicken. Standard size from your store. It can be frozen. Yes, folks... yes. I took 100% rock hard frozen chicken from the fridge and put it in. And it came out to be the most tender delicious chicken ever.- 1 cup rice. You can get fancy here. Mix with a rice medley/lentil mix. Throw in some Quinoa, whatever- 1 tablespoon cayenne pepper- 1 tablespoon pink himilayan sea salt- 1 tablespoon garlic powder, or better yet a cloveAh heck, you don't even have to be a pro-chef to make a delicious meal. You can use my recipe above and subsitiute it with beef, squash, bison, lamb or whatever.This thing takes completely RAW ingredients and makes them delicious meal in 35 minutes. Thank you PRESSURE! And thank you Instant Pot!!!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've had the instant pot for a few months now.  At first, I used it a few times and then it sat unused for a few weeks after some failures and burn messages.After experimenting a bit and finding a few good recipes, the IP gets used a lot now.  Sometimes every weekday for weeks on end.It takes a bit of getting used to and with this knowledge it becomes easier to identify recipes that will work well, be able to modify recipes and portions.I mostly go for the one pot solutions when I need no hassel and speed.The pot is not that much quicker than a lot of the weeknight stuff I cook, pasta, chicken, rice, since it takes a long time to build pressure, but it is mostly hands free after closing the lid."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I never thought I would find something to make cooking (and cooking WELL) easier, but here it is!  I was so scared to use this, because it looked fairly intimidating.  I had never even used a pressure cooker before.  But I've used it on multiple things now - cauliflower rice, orzo, soup, etc.  For example, yesterday I was making Tomato Tortellini and Sausage soup - sauteed the sausage and onions first on the Saute function, then added stock, water, and tomatoes and turned on the Soup function.  After 3 min on Soup, I put it on Slow Cook while we were at the gym to keep it warm. Then finally, to cook the tortellini and spinach, I just had to put it on Soup for another 2 minutes!  It's totally trial and error, and I'm glad I used soup as one of the first things I cooked (because it's easy and takes a lot to screw up), but everything I've done has come out perfect.  Plus, it comes with a guide, and we reference a lot of timing things off Pinterest!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This thing is truly a gem, and at a great price!  The saute feature is really cool, but you need to keep close watch on it for things sticking.  Like bacon.  It does a great job, but you'll be tempted to go higher temp, but don't.  Take your time and use the low or medium setting.  I'd also like to add that it has a safety feature if you skimp too much on added liquid.  For all pressure cookers, you must add a sufficient amount of water or other liquid, like cooking stock.  If you don't, or the dry food items, like rice, don't have enough liquid to soak up, the unit automatically shuts off and actually says its out of liquid (or something like that).  When I vented and opened the lid, sure enough, the rice had absorbed all the liquid before reaching the end of the prssure cooking cycle.  but it stopped BEFORE the rice began to stick to the bottom, which would've been a bear to scrape off.  the versitility of the unit is truly amazing!"
1.0 out of 5 stars,"I have had 3 of the 8qt instant pot's. The first one was damaged when it arrived the seal to the base was broken and it wouldn't even set evenly on the counter top. Amazon replaced it. The second one had some internal pressure leak and sucked the metal inward making it unsafe to use. We spent extra money and bought a different model for the 3rd one and it has been used about 6 times. 4 of those it has malfunctioned and told me ""burn"".  I have had all the correct or more liquid in the machine, I have stopped it and stirred it.  Its ridiculous. The 6quart was a way better machine hands down. I only bought this because I have a family of 7 and we like leftovers. The 6quart was awesome. Don't buy this one if you expect it to work."
3.0 out of 5 stars,"It's important to realize that the ""program"" are just suggested starting points with settings that need to be adjusted further in most cases. IMO it would be a lot less confusing to provide a list of suggested settings for various foods. With this in mind, you don't really need to pay more for advanced models with more ""programs"". But choose your size carefully. The internet is by far your best resource for figuring out how to cook things. Ultimately, I do like the Instapot. The stainless steal pot is nice. Don't consider any alternative without one. I have no idea how long it might last. But with lots of moisture and pressure present with every use, I would guess that it's just a matter of time and number of uses until the electronics puke. Finally, various models of instapots are regular a Prime day item and go on sale often. Choose your preferred model and wait for the inevitable sale."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"If you do most of the cooking in your household then this thing will be life changing for you! No more do you have to plan meals the day before and get them in the slow cooker early to allow them to cook all day. Dinner plans can be decided last minute now! This was our first time using a pressure cooker so it was a little intimidating at first but that all changed after the first time using it. You can google ""instant pot recipes"" and come up with plenty of great recipes and ideas for dinner. Most of the recipes walk you through the entire process step by step, button by button, so it takes the guess work out of learning how to use the Instant Pot. Most recipes can all be done in the same pot which makes clean up an easy task. Also if you like to meal prep, this thing could save you a lot of time. After using this a couple of times, this was our Christmas present to many of our family members, its that good!!! So if you haven't already, buy one of these and see what all the hype is about! You'll thank yourself later ;-)"
4.0 out of 5 stars,"I wish I could exchange for 10qt one. The bottom does get stained so not nonstick.  The timing in the book is off on some things. Even the cookbook I brought the time was off. No 12 minute potato (18-20 minutes). Overall, I love this device. I don't think I will use all the functions, but so far so good. I have cooked 2 different thick steaks (Ribeye and TBone). The steaks held their favor after sauteing. The book said 20 minutes. I should have listened.  I cooked the ribeye 25 minutes. A knife was not needed. I never had a very well cooked, fall off the bone, flavorful steak before. I don't know how to naturally get the device to release. However, I will reread the material sent. I love my instant pot. I only complaint is it is not bigger.  Note, I can't talk about the durability.  I only have had it for a week. I wish verified purchases would post purchase date and review dates. It gives a fuller picture of the review."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"It is the perfect pot for college students, really. It cooks my meals in less that 30 minutes, unless the recipe indicates otherwise. the rice is perfect every time, and best of all I can just dump the food in it as is and the meal turns out perfect! I know how to cook but this instant pot makes cooking practically nothing.the only downside is that the 3q  is kind of too small for my needs, but that is my bad I was hesitating if I should get the 3qrt or the 6qrt. For reference, one Cornish hen would sit comfortably inside a 3qrt but I don't know if a whole chicken would unless you cut it into quarters."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Nope, not exaggerating.  Greatest kitchen invention ever.  I have purposely waiting 4 months before writing a review for this. I wanted to see if my love affair with the Instant Pot was just a fling or true love.  It's true love.  This might have single handedly saved my marriage. Ok, perhaps that is an exaggeration, but not far from it.I work full time.  So does my husband. I get home first and generally cook dinner.  I eat primarly vegetarian - no RED MEAT ever.  My husband eats primarily CARNIVORE style.  Cooking two seperate things has been a real pain and challenge, PLUS I know very little about cooking meat.  The instant pot has changed all of that.  I can make something for him FAST and easy, and not have to worry about ruining it.Let me say, read the manual.  And then read it again and then keep close by as a reference.  I use this thing at least twice a week.  I cook things in it that are so simple and easy and taste like you have been slaving away in the kitchen.  The lifesaving part is how fast it is.  Yes, it's faster than cooking on the stove for the most part, PLUS you don't have to keep tending to whatever you are cooking.  Put it in and go.I was very hesitant to pay this much for a ""gadget"" that I wasn't too sure about, but I hit a home run on this one.  There are many recipes on pinterest for the instant pot, plus I have purchased some books off of Amazon for it.  Once you get the hang of using it (there is not much learning curve - just follow the directions and use some common sense) you can think of many things that you cook on the stove or the crockpot that you will now do in the Instant Pot.  I really love it. I would give it 10 starts if I could."
1.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought this for a wedding gift months ago, well ahead of the wedding. This week end, I took it out of the amazon gift bag because I’d decided to wrap it myself before gifting it. I’m glad I did. The box was in really bad shape and had been wrapped with packing tape. I decided to open the package to make sure the pot wasn’t damaged. I’m glad I did, because the pot clearly was USED. Needless to say, the bride and groom received a card with an explanation. I will by a new instant pot—and all future wedding gifts—from an in-person store to make sure I am getting a new product."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I am so excited about my InstantPot!  I have been posting to Facebook and telling everyone to get one.I made ribs one night...speedy 15 minute dinner that tasted like they had cooked for hours!  Delicious!I bought a pot roast at the store when it was on sale.  An hour later, we had a Sunday dinner for for a king!  Tasted just like my mom's, without the 4 hour wait.Hard boiled eggs, the best I have ever made/had.  Shells were perfect, was able to color them for Easter.  I can also hard boiled a dozen at a time, which is great.  I eat hard boiled eggs as a snack, breakfast on the go, and make a deviled egg salad that is to die for.Haven't ventured into baking in it yet, or yogurt making.  Will wait until I get my own place, as my roommate is more into eating than cooking!!"
1.0 out of 5 stars,"I guess it works if you don't want to use it for what it was designed for.  I have yet to actually get it to work as a rice cooker, or a pressure cooker.  Turn it on and it displays ""burn"", deglaze the pot, repeat and ""burn""/deglaze again.  Did I mention that it will display ""burn"" when you try to use it?  EVEN AFTER it has been deglazed and there is only water in the pot?  Even tried to give it away and NOBODY WANTED IT!!!!!!!!!!And try getting any support for InstaPot, that is just not an option either."
2.0 out of 5 stars,"BE WARNED!! The rubber ring that seals the pot picks up cooking smells that transfer to your next dish. If you think cumin from a lentil curry ruins pea soup (it does) this product is not for you. Apparently folks get around this hassle by storing the ring in coffee grinds or buying several to change out for dedicated flavor profiles (sweet, savory, etc.). After spending $100 on the unit itself, I'm not really enthusiastic about spending more money on extra rings. Otherwise this thing is amazing and I love it. The company should be upfront about this issue and include extra rings. I have the insurance, but I'm probably going to return within the Amazon acceptable return window. So disappointed in what is otherwise a terrific machine."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my third one, and this time I'm happy! So easy to handle. It has replaced my slowcooker completely, and warms up leftovers so much better than the microwave! Especially frozen ones. Perfect yogurt. Beans in 1/2 hour from dry: great for a quick batch of hummus!It'll be nice when accessories become more available, like spare silicone seals, stackable pot-in-pot, etc...I believe the IP can pay for itself eventually, by saving on utilities. We used our pressure cooker twice a day when I was growing up in post-war Europe for that reason.And I want to thank the CEO for listening to customers. It shows."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This will be my 3rd Instant Pot order!  Not because there was something wrong but because this little appliance is soooooo amazing.  I initially ordered this for a family Christmas present a couple years ago as the price was severely cut and I thought it would make a nice rice cooker at least.  One of those spontaneous buys that turned out to be surprisingly GREAT!  The first thing we made with it was a soup and I cannot express enough how amazing the flavor was (as if it were cooking all day on slow but only took less than an hour).....I then moved on to throwing any and everything in the pot and again it created magic soup!  One day, we were depleted of food in the house and all I had was a bag of asparagus, broccoli, butternut squash and a severely hungry stomach so I threw the veggies in with a few seasonings/olive oil and to my surprise, probably one of the best soups (they are all great) we've made in the pot.  We have also made lots of rice in the pot and our kids prefer this rice over stove cooking and it does seem to be much moister (I'm grain free).  So, the following Christmas, I gifted this to my mother-in-law who is older now and has pretty serious diabetes - She loves it!  This year, I gifted the pot to my sister who has a very limited budget, little time being a single parent working long hours.....she too has now become an Instant Pot fan (and she has an impressive culinary background).  This is just the most amazing appliance ever!Pros:Pre-programmable buttons for different dishesVery little time to make delicious foodsCompact enough to store in most cabinetsCons:I really don't have any but cleaning the lid (rubber rings) however this is to be expected with 'any' appliance, cooking tools."
5.0 out of 5 stars,I wanted something I could make batches of good healthy food to freeze and also to take to work the only issue I have is in hindsight I wish I’d bought the 6qt so I could make more in a single cook.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This appliance changed my life! I want to give it more than 5 stars. It speeds up the time for cooking beans, rice, soups, and other dry grains, plus it seals in flavors and makes the final product have a more savory and complex flavor.Mostly, I use it for soups and beans. I cook big pots of refried beans to eat as a nutritious and inexpensive staple throughout the week.I have lost 20 lbs and saved hundreds of dollars on food in the 6 months since I purchased the Instant Pot.My sister baked a cake in it. The cake was moist and delicious.Additionally, I have made omelettes, steel cut oatmeal, rice pudding, and the best mashed potatoes ever.The only con is that it comes with very limited recipes and you need a separate book or to join an online group for recipes."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"The wife 'had' to have one of these(because all of her friends had recently gotten them)When they were on sale for Christmas, I gave in(We already have 3 crock pots and never use any of them)Fast forward 3 weeks, and it was still sitting on the counter un-used.So, to keep from taking a sledge hammer to it, I decided to try it out.(maybe that was her plan all along.....)I am not a fan of traditional 'crock pot type meals'!!!!!(too many pot lucks when I was growing up)I have to say - this thing is pretty amazing and I am glad we got it.  Even if I am the one that has to use it.  I've made 3 meals so far, and every one has been delicious.  Even our picky 5 year old liked them!(he normally survives strictly on chicken nuggets)2 things to know......1.  Prep time is usually 30min - 1hr for most meals2.  It takes 10-20min to reach temp and pressurize before the cook time starts, and another 5 - 20min to cool and de-pressurize.So,  if the recipe says 5min cook time = 30min real timeStill, I cooked a 2.5lb pork roast in 1 hour (plus 15min warm up and 15min cool down)"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my 3rd Instant Pot.  I already have the 6-Quart and the 8-quart  I bought another Mini for my sister as a gift, as she has a 6-quart also.We are now ""pot heads"". (People who go on about how they love their Instant Pots)  It is important that there is the Yogurt setting, as I do cultured foods such as Natto and Amazake.  (I have a batch of natto in my 3 Qt now.)I made a huge pot of bone broth in the 8 Qt--letting it slow cook for 24 hours. The richest beef broth I had ever made.  I used to hate peeling hard boiled  eggs. Now, its 5 minutes to cook, 5 minutes to rest, and the shells come right off smoothly, not leaving any nicks in the eggs. I could go on, but the bottom line is you can't go wrong with an Instant Pot."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Yeah, I love it.  I know so many people who have these now, and literally every one of them loves it!  Like 5 star loves it!  It's really well built and should last a lifetime.  I did have one teeny issue - that little condensation catcher they provide fits into a receptacle that has some tiny little ""wings"" to hold it in place.  Those wings are the most flimsy part of this unit, and breaking one off is entirely too easy!  I did it.  Luckily that catcher isn't really all that important, so you could go without it, or put it in place with some double sided Velcro if you really thought it was necessary.  I was actually able to repair it with super glue, but that was pure luck."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I do love it, it has a learning curve that is significant tho. I started with meat and quickly learned this is not at all like crockpot cooking. So I went to easier stuff, rice, quinoa, stew, chili, then ""boiled"" eggs, then my own fake version of sous vide egg bites that are super devine, and I now bake cupcakes and whole roasts and veggies in there. I mean I haven't found anything it can't really do. Besides give you a crispy edge. Still need a broiler or super hot pan for that. But I am thinking about getting a fleet of these. Super awesome for potlucks because the lid seals, unlike my crockpot, making it easy and safe for transporting. AND I can take it somewhere where dinner won't be served for an hour or so and set it to cook while the meeting happens. Food is ready and stays warm and delicious in there."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I thought my slow cooker was great until I got this. This gadget will cook chicken from frozen to falling apart in 38 minutes! It cooks yogurt, which I've yet to try, sautés, slow cooks and more. I made spaghetti and meatballs, meatloaf, chicken and dumplings. They all turned out great. If I am in the mood for chicken, I search for instant pot chicken recipes online and many come up with detailed instructions. I would definitively recommend this pot to anyone. Great for busy moms. I do wish that it came with more accessories. My friend had one, so when I ordered one myself, I didn't know I had to order the accessories separately. You will more than likely need the wire trivot, although if you see a recipe that calls for a certain accessory, you can search the internet and sometimes find a different way to cook the same dish without the need for that accessory."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've had my Duo60 for almost a month now and I love it.  Before getting it I made sure to read up on recipe ideas, how they differ from standard stove top pressure cookers, and I watched every video I could find on the subject.  I tend to do that with every kitchen product I buy so I know if I really want it beforehand, and what mistakes to avoid after it arrives.Tonight as a last minute dinner idea I tossed in 4 frozen solid chicken legs and thighs, poured in some soy sauce, vinegar and Mirin; pressed the poultry button; and twenty-something minutes later I had perfectly cooked and flavorful Adobo.  Without my Instant Pot it probably would have been fast food instead."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"OK so I had been hearing all the hype but was afraid to use a pressure cooler.  I finally gave in recently and bought this model.  My only regret was waiting this long!  I recommend watching a you tube video first but it is sooo easy to use and letting out the steam is not scary at all.  I use it a few times a week.  I made ribs the other day... instead of 3 hours in the oven, they were done in 25 minutes and then I just slapped them on the grill for a few minutes to caramelize them.  Pork shoulder which takes 16 hours in a crock-pot takes 45 minutes.  I even cooked a frozen pork loin the other day in about 30 minutes.  The only catch, it takes about 5 minutes (never timed it) for it to get up to the temp you want, and then if you let it slowly release steam on its own its another 10 min of cooking time.  Honestly, this is now my favorite thing in the kitchen! :)"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"The BEST small kitchen appliance I own! I used my first one for 4 years and it was still going strong (until I set it on the stove and melted the cord and bottom ... woops). I could hardly wait to get my new one. I use it for everything. It makes the clearest, most wonderful soup broth I've ever seen, the pressure cooker function is easy to use and you don't have to worry about keeping the temp right, like those bummer stove top styles. I have used every function on it, repeatedly -even the yogurt making one- and everything turns out perfect. I literally cannot live without this tool. The best money you'll ever spend for a coooking device. I love it as much as my Kitchen Aide Mixer (and that's saying a LOT), but it's even better because I use it so much more. This thing does EVERYTHING! <3 If there were 10 stars, I'd totally give it 10!!  The one thing you may want is to get one of the Instant Pot cookbooks that are available, because the one that comes with it isn't all that great. However, I've used mine without an additional cookbook using my own ideas and recipes and have loved it."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"Love this Mini Instant Pot.  It does what its supposed to do, and occupy very little counter space. It's my go to for quick, small meal preparation and I'm glad I purchased it.  I deducted a star because I wished it was easier to clean-Food sticks to the bottom and needs to be soaked to be removed.I do highly recommend the Mini if you have a small family, on a diet, or just being careful about the overuse of oils and butters in your foods."
5.0 out of 5 stars,This is a MUST BUY! Especially if you are a busy momma! I was so scared to use my InstaPot when I first got it. I had already watched YouTube videos on how to use it but had also seen / read horror stories. Let me put you at ease... It’s not bad at all. I was terrified to release pressure the first time but I’m over it. Still a beginner and finding recipes I like. We’ve made several rotisserie chickens in it (Jen Leppert has a great recipe / instruction video on youtube) and we’ve made yogurt (sounds crazy but OMG so much better than the store brand and you save money- Pressure Luck Cooking and Todd Gleason Both have great videos). So happy we got this and can’t wait to see what other recipes become our faves.
1.0 out of 5 stars,"This one is not for a begginer. Burns rice, the soup/stew burns soup as it gets to a high, full rolling boil. Sauté,, slow cooker work nice. Pressure cook is ok but trying to tenderize beef,or pork just boils too high. Perhaps I need to practice more but if I could adjust temp, foods might not stick. I wish I had purchased the one that I could adjust the temp settings.  I don’t recommend this one."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I don't know what we did without our InstaPot!  We're on our third one!  I broke the first one (dropped it).  The second was a 6 qt Duo Plus.  With only two of us left in the household there is no need for one so large.  This one is the 3 qt size. Perfect!  We use it all the time, especially during the summer.  I can cook a great meal without heating up the house and needing the A/C to work constantly.  I haven't tried the yogurt function yet; it's next on my list!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I was initially afraid to use this because of the steam release process. Old pressure cookers would sometimes explode if the pressure got too great and I guess that was in my mind when I got this. Since then I've gotten over my fears and it is now my go-to cooker! I make yummy yogurt, my first successful pot roast with veggies, pinto beans in a fraction of the time it used to take. What's not to like?? Wish it came with a few recipes, but the internet is full of them, so that's minor. Buy one, especially when they are on sale, and you'll never look back!"
3.0 out of 5 stars,"The instant pot is super. I love the button choices and the ability to start with frozen foods. What I hate is, there is no warning light or sound to tell the user when the liner is not in place. I ruined my very expensive instant pot by putting ingredients in the unit without the liner. So many people have done this I think it increases their sales by a huge percentage. It would be so simple to have an alert. I did everything to dry mine out but after a month of such activity, I tried to use it and it smoked. I had to throw it away per Instapot support."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I resisted purchasing an electric pressure cooker for years. I've used stove top models for the past 25 years and I've always felt like they were adequate and it was not necessary to buy of these new-fangled multi-function showboats!  However I purchased the Instant Pot in the 6-qt model for a friend of mine, who doesn't do a lot of cooking and is a very busy working mother of two busy kids. I thought that this would help her to prepare quick, nutritious, easy meals for her family. When I got a good look at it, I decided to purchase the 8-quart model for myself to give it a go. I cannot tell you how happy I am that I broke down and bought it. This appliance is so much simpler to use. I can actually drink my wine while preparing my meals when using this. No more intense thinking about the best method for each entree or remembering to set timers (how long has it been at full pressure????), which is good for this middle-aged woman who has a healthy red wine habit and advanced multiple sclerosis (memory is not my forte).  I have made numerous dishes, mostly utilizing the PC function, combined with the saute function beforehand.  The greatest thing about this PC/multi-function appliance is how simplistic it is when compared to its (ancient) cousin, the stovetop pressure cooker.  Despite telling myself for years that my stovetop PCs (I have 3 of them) could do everything that the new electric models could do, it takes much more effort and there is a steeper learning curve. After using them for years, there was still the occasional scorched ingredients in the bottom of the cooker.  No more.  Yes, I know, you can use the PIP method. But that significantly decreases the capacity of your PC. You have to find a heatproof bowl/ casserole dish that fits into the PC and still holds a decent amount of food. I've made curries, pulled pork, numerous breakfast recipes, and all have turned out fantastic.  My stovetop models are still useful but this is my go-to cooker.  I can use the stovetop models I have to ""bake"" potatoes, quick steam veggies, hard boil eggs, etc while main dishes are cooking in the new Instant Pot.  Other advantages:1.  You only need a power supply to use it.  If you have a huge group at your home, it can go in the next room (in my case, the laundry room) and free up my cooktop and counter space.2.  It is silent.3.  There is NEVER anything scorched on the bottom.  The only time I use the PIP method is when I am putting something in ramekins or dessert pans such as springform pans, etc.4.  Non-PC users are no longer terrified in my kitchen.  I am sold!"

After using a slow cooker for years, we were very familiar with cooking in those types of system but have heard many great things about the instant pot and even had our Niece raving about them so we broke down and bought the 6qt model since we are empty nesters now. Our first experience was making a pot roast, and I have to say that it turned out better than I have eaten at many expensive restaurants. Fork tender, very flavorful!!! Taking out of box was a snap as there is really no assembly other than installing the condensation collector which easily slides into a couple of ribs on the side of the product. Seems very straight forward to program using the numerous preprogrammed settings but can also adjust manually if needed. This product also the ability to set a delayed start so you can setup in the morning before leaving for work and know that when you get home the meal will be steaming hot. Looking through the included recipe book for a couple of recipes for our next meal but we also going to look for a much more inclusive recipe book online.Loved it so much we just bought one for my daughter and her husband! They are thrilled and I am sure they are going to be just as excited when they finally receive it."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"For the price, size, and versatility this product is hard to beat.  I have cooked a few meals, some old fashion oat mean, and rice with it so far.Two points of note:1.  The pot that you are cooking in spin very freely and can make life more than a challenge when stirring or sauteing.2.  The lid when it unlocks dow not always release the pot.  If you are not careful the pot will FALL off of the lid, this can lead to injury and burns, not to mention a bit of a mess.  So far we have been lucky and no one in my household has been injured.Those 2 prevent the 5 star rating.  Overall a great item to have in any kitchen."
3.0 out of 5 stars,"The float valve anti-block shield is documented as requiring installation and being removable for cleaning but it came already installed and is not removable. Possibly defective? So far it's functioning. The many convenience buttons get completely inadequate explanations, especially if you've never used a pressure cooker before. The pressure seal ring in the lid should be easier to remove and re-insert and seems rather fragile. But I've steamed carrots, cooked a sweet potato, some lentils, and a couple of batches of rice without anything coming out inedible, there's that."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Got the 6 qt duo yesterday and unboxed making sure all parts were there. Washed with warm soapy water and did the water test. Took about 4 minutes to do the test. Left white spots on the stainless but thats easy to remove. Made sloppy joes in it for dinner. Do not expect perfect ground beef from a frozen roll in this as the cook time will triple. Your pressure release will be loose feeling, but that is normal so don't sweat it. After dinner was done, i rinsed with hot water and let it sit in water for about 5 minutes and it washed out perfect with no scrubbing but it is dishwasher safe. The cookbook included doesn't give great times for some recipes, but trial and error right? So far I've made 3 meals in it, with no issues. I am so glad i didn't wait to get this."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Since I already owned both a pressure cooker and a slow cooker, I was not sure I really needed this. But I was intrigued by the reviews I read and videos I saw. The price was not unreasonable given its versatility so I went for it. I have not been disappointed, and have now given away my pressure cooker and slow cooker, saving space. A big advantage is being able to go from pressure cooking to slow cooking or visa-versa in the same utensil, as well as being able to brown ingredients in the same pot when slow cooking (this usually has to be done in a separate pan on the stove top).  And, when pressure cooking, you don't have to stand around and wait for the gauge to get to the right place and then adjust the heat. This happens automatically, though you still have to take a stab at timing (there's a manual to guide that) to ensure you cook it the way you want. The rice cooker makes wonderful, fluffy rice. I gave my traditional rice cooker away years ago because it took up space and was not any better than what I could do stove-top. This cooker does what it says, and since our family is mostly eating brown rice these days, which takes longer to steam, this pot is a wonderful time-saver.At some point I may buy an additional liner pot so that I can slow or pressure cook one item and then set it aside as I make another part of the meal such as rice. I already purchased the glass lid that can be used for slow cooking so you can keep an eye on how things are cooking.This cooker also makes yogurt and can pressure can small jars of food. I have tried neither of these yet but plan to do so at some time in the future."
1.0 out of 5 stars,"This worked when I first got it. The ""PRESSURE COOK"" button worked and I was able to set the time and cook. It was used twice and then, when I went to use it again, I noticed that half the buttons did not work. The ones that are on the left side do not respond AT ALL when pressed. The buttons on the left are ""POULTRY"" ""SAUTE"" ""SOUP"" ""MEAT"" ""SLOW COOK"" ""BEAN"" The pot is still sitting on the kitchen counter but, those buttons on the left are clearly not connected properly or something because nothing happens when you press them. I wrote to Instant Pot customer service to try and get help but, they never responded. I wrote them twice. I was hoping there was a quick fix for it, like a reset or something but, no one ever responded to my service requests. This is incredibly disappointing and frustrating as I did not realize it wasn't working properly until recently. I really hope I can, at the very least, exchange it for one that works. Although, I am very leery of this product altogether after spending this amount and having this experience."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have had this pot in my amazon cart for... a year.  My husband AND parents bought me one for Christmas this year! Basically I have made 2 things in the instant pot so far - French Onion Soup + Mashed Potatoes... The french onion soup was awesome! The potatoes took 2 tries... but the second time was awesome. There's a bit of a learning curve. It's nice to have friends/family members that the same pot. There's so many resources available online as well. I highly recommend this instant pot and cannot wait to make more recipes. :)Super easy... for the most part. One thing I've found to be true - I'll hear all my friends saying it took me 5 minutes to make potatoes... well yah, I set the instant pot on manual for 5 minutes but they did not take 5 minutes to cook. - It did take 5 minutes after the 10 minutes it took to build pressure. 20 minutes in total. Best advice would be, be patient and enjoy your new appliance."
1.0 out of 5 stars,Stopped working after 3 uses.  Won’t even power on. Waste of money.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Absolutely love it.  The number of buttons is a little daunting at first.  If you have someone who is good at using it, have them show you what to do.  We love the yogurt function.  We cook whole frozen chickens with the 1 hour setting (you have to also add to that hour the heatup and depressurize time).  All of the meats fall of the bone, and bones get very very soft.  Get a spare gasket if you make meats or seasoned items and you plan to make yogurt.  The gaskets absorb garlic, rosemary, and meat smells, and they get into your yogurt if you don't have a seperate gasket that you reserve only for yogurt.  I would only trust the gaskets from the manufacturer's website, and their prices and shipping are very reasonable."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This thing is amazing. Buy it. You won't regret it! It makes cooking so easy, I can make a fresh dinner every night in a flash. When I get home from the gym I just dump in the ingredients and turn it on, and by the time I get out of the shower it's done! Pinterest has a bunch of amazing recopies that are all super easy and delicious, and the ultimate instant pot cookbook is super helpful! Trust me, don't settle for less. This is what you want."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"It has so many Amazing features. It can cook frozen food in like 20 minutes. It's amazing and does such a good job with anything you decide to make. Stews, steamed veggies, slow cooking, all of it.But probably the best feature is that it's such a good appliance, it helped me to convince THE hottest woman in the entire Midwest to move in with me. She is so amazing and now I can marry and spend my life with her thanks to the convenience and ease of this glorious cooker!Thanks instant pot!"
1.0 out of 5 stars,"I got a used Instant pot. The buttons have spots that are worn and print rubbed off. I didn't bother reading the reviews because this brand is so well known and liked. Considering the life of many instant pots seem to be only a year, after reading these reviews, this is very disappointing. It seems to work fine for now but I'll probably be returning it because it's obviously used and who knows how long it will work or if it has any malfunctions that could potentially be dangerous! I hate having to deal with the hassle of returning items, ESPECIALLY over something like this! I paid for a NEW unit. That's what I should've recieved! Total BS. I'll be looking for a different brand pressure cooker now. Lesson learned, ALWAYS read the reviews even when I think it will be fine."
5.0 out of 5 stars,My wife and I made beef stroganoff for our first meal and it came out great! The stainless steel pot was easy to clean and they have great links for recipes on their web site. I prefer stainless steel to the non stick coatings because I don't think the non stick surfaces are safe health wise. Did you know you can make cheese cake in a pressure cooker! If you go to the manufactures web page to register your unit it will ask you for the model number and serial number. The model number is on a silver sticker on the side of the unit. The serial number however is on the bottom of the unit on a piece of tape. I only mention this because I had a hard time finding it and I was not able to find the serial number location in the manual. Other than that the instructions are easy to understand and in my opinion there was a lot of thought put into the design of this unit. Overall it was a very positive experience cooking with this unit and I look forward to using it on a regular basis! One other thing. The cover has arrows and a lock and unlock glyph to assist the user in installing and removing the cover. However the glyphs are black on black and not easy to see without the use of a flash light. So I took some white house paint and using a Q-tip just dabbed some white paint on the arrows to make it easier to install the lid and lock it. I also emailed the manufacturer and suggested that they highlight the arrows to make it easier to install the lid and lock it. But overall this is the best pressure cooker I have ever used and am really excited about preparing meals on a regular basis with it!
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is by far one of the most useful kitchen appliances I have ever purchased. I haven't made full use of all the features, but if all I ever use it for is for cooking frozen chicken breasts in 15 minutes and making soups and stews, it will have been well worth the purchase price. I got it on sale when it was $49.99 and used Amazon points to knock the price down to about $10. It would be nice if it came with a steamer rack, but for $10 I really can't complain. Steamer racks and other accessories are relatively inexpensive. There are tons of free Instant Pot recipes at instantpot.com available for download and there is a myriad of other websites/user groups which share Instant Pot recipes. I'm not sure if I'll ever make my own yogurt, but I will most definitely be trying out many many more IP recipes. This this is a real time-saver for busy folks on-the-go!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Finally got an Instant Pot after many months of reading about them. I'm glad I did. It's really worked out so far as a pressure cooker and rice maker. Made a delicious pork loin with veggies and gravy in less than 1 1/2 hour. Delicious chili in less than an hour. Saute function works wonderfully for browning meat before cooking. Very easy to clean the stainless cooking pot. Only disadvantage for me is the fact that it is too large to keep out on the counter, so I have to store it in the basement. Loads of recipes on-line. Great if you have last minute company - e.g. made pulled pork from a half pork butt (usually a 4-6 hour process) in just over 1 1/2 hour."
2.0 out of 5 stars,"I have owned this Instant Pot for 18 months.  While I had it, it worked great with fairly regular use.  Recently, when I was using the saute function to brown some onions before adding beans to pressure cook, and it just simply stopped working.  The control panel just went dark.  I tried plugging it in to other outlets to make sure that wasn't the problem, but it never turned back on again.I contacted the company for assistance, and received a simple notice that since the product was past the warranty, they could offer me a 15% discount at their website.  That wasn't really worth my time pursuing, since I can get something cheaper and with free shipping on Amazon.  I'm super disappointed in the product."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"When we moved to our new home we got rid of our crockpot, rice cooker and a couple of dutch ovens with the intent of using the Instant Pot as a kitchen multi-tool. However, I can't give it a 5 just yet because I have only used it a couple of times and am getting used to its functions and the procedures. So far, it has worked pretty much as advertised. I cooked brown rice with moderate success but haven't quite got the process perfected. I tried slow cooking, but that is where I am really unsure of how well it works. The chicken tikka masala I made never got hot enough on high (more in their jargon) so that I had confidence in what i was doing or that it was cooking. I used the glass cover they sell, but next time I will keep the original lid on and see if that makes a difference. The lemon chicken thighs I made came out better using a combination of searing and pressure cooking."

   I love the instant pot it is so versatile and since I’m pregnant it is very helpful when I’m tired and don’t feel like standing at the stove for hours . My favorite thing to make is pot roast but I have made tons of other things and it comes out perfect every single time it’s good for pros or beginners definitely kicks crock pots to the curb it’s a game changer love it"
4.0 out of 5 stars,"cook any meal fast, conveniences. easy to clean. i had to deduct one star because it's still very expensive. There are other brand of pressure cooker that are just as effective and cheaper.  it would be nice it they come with a few extra thing such as a steam basket, a glass lid or a plastic cover for any leftover to be store in fridge. Just a few more convenient things to make our lives easier without jacking up the price or make us pay extra for those needed items."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This thing is amazing.  I got this on Black Friday for my girlfriend after hearing her casually mention it, but didn't really understand what you could do with it.  So far we've taken frozen chicken breast and about 30 minutes later we have delicious shredded chicken.  We've made soups, cooked potatoes and even have done hard-boiled eggs (they seriously came out perfect).  This thing is like a little miracle.  It is by far our new favorite toy much to the dismay of our slow cookers.  We did a 4-pound pork roast in less than an hour and it turned out very good as well.  You can even make hamburgers (we made Juicy Lucy's) with it!  This thing is so efficient and quick that I'm concerned that my g/f may just leave me for the Instant Pot so she can keep all the good food for herself.  Hell, if this thing had a sexual stimulation button it'd probably make it happen 10x faster than I could too.  Crazy good product!"
1.0 out of 5 stars,"I was very excited when I bought this unit. I had friends who raved about it. It initially worked great and I was very pleased. But after 5-8 times of using it, I started receiving a ""burn"" message on the unit and it would turn off. I had a friend over who used the instant pot many times, and she remarked that she didn't know there was a ""burn"" message. I contacted customer service as I believed it was likely just a lemon and I wanted to replace it as I had been happy prior to the messages. Of course, it was greater than 30 days when this happen (approximately 40 days or so) so they stated I was ineligible for a replacement. The customer service then asked for pictures. Then asked me to run a test. Then asked me to run another test in which I had to submit a video back to them. So, I begrudgingly followed their instructions. Their final message to me was instructions on how to cook and a suggestion to use more liquid. Are you kidding me? I am sure this one unit was just a lemon as other people seem to be happy with it. But, based on the fact that customer service was unwilling to work with me on replacing the unit, I must only give it a 1-star review. Too bad. I would have bought another."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"Okay...I am a single dad with 3 boys (7, 4 and 18 months) and have very limited time for cooking. THIS THING IS A GODSEND. It is incredibly easy to use and cuts cooking time down so I can spend more time on other aspects of meal prep (and child wrangling). I only deduct 1 star because it is a bit complicated at first. I had to watch more youtube videos then I care to admit just to ensure I was using it correctly. But after a few uses I got the hang of it and am just absolutely smitten."
5.0 out of 5 stars,Have been using it for three weeks now and absolutely love it. I already own stove top pressure cookers and am not new to pressure cooking. I was hesitant to add one more appliance to the already crowded counter space but after seeing all the videos online I decided I could put it to good use. I cook vegetarian Indian food and this works out very well. I use the stackable cooking vessels that I use with my regular pressure cooker in this to make rice and another item at the same time. I invested in the taller steam racks so my rice vessel does not touch whatever is cooking at the bottom. A steamer basket from IKEA makes nice steamed vegetables. The most advantage for me is using a single vessel and not having to clean the stove (I am a moderately messy cook and Indian food helps facilitate that). The inner pot is easy to clean. After 6 months I plan to get the smaller 3 quart one as we are only two people in the house that don't eat much and don't like eating leftovers.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I just absolutely love love love my InstantPot! It's a must have for those short on time but want a quick, quality meal. I put in meats frozen, set it to 30 mins, add veggies 5 mins before time is up. and dinner is served. However, if the meat is already thawed out, I will search for added flavor and then put in the Instantpot.  I love the warming setting too. Keeps your food warm while you're busy with other prep work.This is fairly easy to use, but  a word of warning: releasing pressure from the steam valve can easily injure.  Please take caution when operating.  I do find the design a bit bulky but otherwise it's such a fantastic addition to your small appliances."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I prefer homemade beans to canned beans. With this Instant Pot I can simply rinse my organic beans of choice, put them in the pot, add water, spices and then push the bean/chili setting (I use 30 minutes). Then I let them cool down naturally for an hour. Because it is so fast and so easy to make beans I only make two cups at a time which allows me to change the combinations of beans and spices I use. Now I make a fresh pot every other day. You can also cook rice (I use black rice and wild rice) or any other grains that you like. And of course you can do vegetables too. Can't comment on meats since I don't eat meat. I have purchased these for some friends and they too love them. I appreciate the stainless steel internal pot and the overall quality of the Instant Pot. I would suggest looking up on YouTube how to use the pot. I found the videos to be a big help and made the written instructions easier to understand."
3.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought the 10 quart model. I like to cook ribs in the pot and the 6 quart is a little tight with 2 racks of ribs. The 10 quart has plenty of room. The reason I gave this 3 stars instead of 5 is due to the lack of accessories for the pot.The rack that comes with the pot is the same size as the one that comes with the 6 quart model. If they’re going to make a bigger pot, they should make accessories to match instead of just sending the same accessories.With the 6 quart model I was able to purchase a glass lid in order to use it as a slow cooker. I didn’t find a glass lid on the instant pot site for the 10 quart model."
2.0 out of 5 stars,"I liked it when it arrived. Used it four times and then problems started. It would not get hot enough to build any pressure. If you slap the side of it, then it would heat up. The problem with that is obvious. So back it went and I purchased a basic unit that sits on the burner. At least then I know if it is working...LOL"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"If you're on the fence, do it. I waited nearly 3 years, and I'm kicking myself for waiting that long. We use our instant pot 4 times a week and have been doing just that for the last 9 months or so, ever since we got it. I'd make sure you find a plethora of recipes to get your use out of it, but that's the easy and fun task."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"The IP is amazing!!! I was skeptical at first because I've bought many kitchen gadgets in the past that was touted to be the best thing ever but never lived up to it.The IP is not one of them. We liked it so much that we bought a second one. It's not just how fast it cooks the food but it seems to lock in the flavors and the food tastes better. I call it the Magic Pot because even when you put different types of food in there, the texture of each food is exactly how it should be.My wife's latest creations are yogurt and apple sauce. Best I ever tasted and it's so easy and quick. If making yogurt, I recommend buying the yogurt strainer sold here on Amazon.Just a tip for beginners. When trying out recipes found online, make a few batches using different times. We found the times in recipes found online are too long and almost always cut the times in half or more. Experiment with your own times.Good luck and enjoy 🤙"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This thing is just awesome. I don’t really know what to add from the advertisements, but it is a game changer Once you get in the habit of using it. I will say, the slow cooker feature doesn’t really do what a real slow cooker does. Other than that, this thing is totally worth it. You put the stuff in, and you don’t have to do anything until it’s done. And it’s safe, easy to use, you don’t have to manage it or watch it or anything. It’s awesome, and the dishes are incredibly flavorful.I do use recipes. I cook so much more now because of this thing. It took me a while to start using it because it was a little bit intimidating, but once I did, it’s one of my main cooking methods for fancy dishes"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love cooking with our new Instant Pot DUO60 6Qt.It is easy, convenient, quick and clean.There is plenty of inspiration on Youtube, offering recipe and, how to's.I was a little hesitant to shorten the process of cooking, as I thought it would have a negative impact on the taste, but I don't think that it does.The inner pot is dishwasher safe, and the ""lid-on at all times"" cooking eliminates the splatter around the cooking area.Being able to cook outside of the kitchen (Wherever there is an electric outlet) free's valuable ""real estate"" in the kitchen.Although I have not yet made any yogurt, our ""old"" yogurt maker is at goodwill, so we did not add any clutter with the instant pot.All things considered, I am very happy with our purchase.I have already recommended this to friends, and: Knowing what I know now:I would buy a pressure cooker again, and I would pick again this very model in this size."
1.0 out of 5 stars,"Alarmingly huge. Venting can potentially put out an eye. Should come with its own fume hood (greasy steam went everywhere). Instructions completely inadequate and baffling and only available online, if you can even find the ones that go with your particular model. Does not actually save any time at all. Food comes out pale and swollen-looking, so you need to put it in a broiler to make it look palatable. Instant Pot cookbook is filled with unappetizing recipes that look just like the ones from my mom’s 1970s crockpot cookbook. Simply an all-around awful product with slick-looking packaging and a deceptive name. Deserves zero stars."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I own an Instant Pot Max but decided I needed a 2nd one so I bought this mini. I lOVE it! Now, unless I need more space, I use the mini. It's not as fancy as the Max, but it's easier to use (lighter weight, easily to clean because its lighter, and not so sensitive-no burn notices!). I like my Max, but I LOVE my mini."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I recently became a vegan and some people on the vegan facebook groups were posting vegan instant pot recipes so I decided to buy one.I first started using it twice a week, then three times a week, and now  I use it almost every day of the week!  It saves a lot of time because I can make rice or other recipes by loading up the stainless steel pot, hitting one or two buttons and walking away.  The pot does the rest, pressure cooking then holding the food hot until I'm ready to serve it (you can also specify that you want the food to cool down when you finish cooking).It does a great job on rice and pretty much every recipe I've thrown at it... lentil curries and various soups.This pot could save time for anyone, vegan or not.  Just take 10 minutes or so to prepare your recipe (usually just chopping stuff up), pop it in the pot, make one or two button selections (including cooking time) and your all set.Apparently it also  a time delay feature which I've never used.Pressure cooking is a very healthy way to prepare food, locking in flavor that might escape when cooking with a traditional pot.  Also, little or no danger of leaving a burner on (we all have those problems as we get older).  So I highly recommend the Instant Pot as many people do!"
1.0 out of 5 stars,My Insta pot is broken the handle is all broken and cracked and falling a part I just received it today the box has holes in it and smashed on one side
5.0 out of 5 stars,I watched my friend make potatoes in like 3 mins using this contraption and was blown away. I had to have one. Spent weeks searching and researching the perfect one and size. Im greedy so i got the big one harrassed my ups guy for 2 days till it arrived. My first dish was pork fried rice and let me tell you!!! It was so easy and amazing as well as i knew every ingredient that wrnt into it!!! Ive saved so much time with this thing from cooking time to washing time and i could not be happier!! Get one!!!
5.0 out of 5 stars,I meal prep. But I’m not thoughtful enough to let me chicken thaw before I start cooking...So...when I’m meal prepping for both me AND my boyfriend (who eats 6 meals a day) it takes a LONG time.This product has saved me so much time and frustration!Cooking is more efficient! In a time crunch I can even cook frozen chicken breast! It’s great.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love love love my Instant Pot! I've had it for about 4 weeks and I use it about 4 to 5 times a week. I look online for different recipes and ideas how to use it. A lot of people say that it seems very overwhelming, but it's not bad at all. Just read the manual, look up recipes and ideas online, and try something simple like beans or rice for your first try. You'll get use to how it works. It's an awesome ""toy""! I've made beans, rice, soups, roasts, whole chickens, cheese cakes, chili, homemade mac and cheese, bone broth, etc. Everything tastes so much better in the Insant Pot!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I'll start out by saying the 8QT instant pot was better than I expected. Unlike some reviews, I found the controls very easy to use. The unit was packaged very well and arrived in perfect condition. Unpacking was also very easy. After washing the bowl and doing the initial water test I jumped right in an made a vegetable soup for the maiden voyage. I used the soup setting for a Tuscan Vegetable soup, it was warmed up and under pressure in about 6 minutes. The cook time was 30 minutes and an instant release was used. The vegetables were perfectly cooked. Cleanup was very easy. I dove right into a pork tenderloin. Using the saute feature I browned the pork and then 2 onions. Using the manual setting for 15 minutes, and then a 10 minute release and 5 minute rest, the pork was absolutely tender. Once of the tastiest tenderloins I have had. The cleanup was again very easy. I am well pleased with my purchase and plan on using this for batch vegetables, soups and roasts for multiple days. Great purchase, better than expected."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have never owned a pressure cooker, and I really didn't want to invest in another kitchen cooker, but this thing is awesome!There is a learning curve to using this pressure cooker, but it is well worth it!!  Being able to cook foods even from frozen is a huge time saver, since I can still prepare meat even if I forget to thaw it out.  And having foods come out tender after only 20-30 minutes cook time is amazing.  I can cook the main dish in the pressure cooker, and I don't have to tend to it all all while I prepare side dishes or a salad or sauce, etc.  There are tons of recipes on the internet although a cook book is also a good idea for beginners.The pressure cooker yields the same results as a crockpot on say, a tough cut of meat, cooking it into a tender delicious meat, but in a fraction of the time.  Sometimes I just don't plan ahead, but I can still cook meat even from frozen, and it comes out great.  I can start it cooking, and then kind of ""set it and forget it"" while I tend to side dishes.  I don't have to keep an eye on it, or stir it.Also, I found with some crock pot recipes, with ingredients like fruits or some of the chinese food recipes, they tended to kind of melt together and lose flavor if I started them before work and then came home for dinner.  That doesn't happen with the instant pot.  Less cooking time, so flavor stays fresher.  Chicken breast can dry out in a slow cooker, it doesn't happen with an instant pot.It really does replace numerous appliances, it can be used as a rice cooker also, and can still function as a slow cooker.  It really does live up to the hype!Also - the saute function is the bomb!  With a crockpot, if you want to brown the meat first, or cook bacon, it requires another pan.  With the instant pot, you get to literally do it all in one pot.  Plus you have the browning from the sauteing that adds another level of flavor.Another thing is, I really think that with the pressure, the foods absorb more of the seasonings.  I have found foods just come out tasting better.  I made a Ropa Vieja that was just delicious, even though it was the same recipe I've used before.I've used it to ""bake"" sweet potatoes, which took a lot less time than the oven, so dinner took a lot less time to prepare, and I didn't heat up the whole kitchen, another big plus.  While it is really ""steaming"" them (the skins are wet, not dry and crispy like they are in the oven), it really seemed to have more flavor!  My daughter was scraping the last of the sweet potato off the skins, when she usually just eats the middle and leaves a lot of sweet potato still attached to the skins.I've only had mine for a couple of weeks, but I'm already a huge fan.  The IP has all the benefits of slow cooking, but so many more options!!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have three instant pots and my mini died after just a few uses.  I contacted IP and was asked to provide pertinent information,  including proof of purchase,  photos of the interior to show that it wasn't damaged and a photo of the exterior showing that it was plugged in but wouldn't come on.  After that, they sent me a new IP.  They were professional, appropriate and responsive.  I was very impressed and love my product."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I was hesitant to try this, since I already own a plethora of cooking appliances including crockpots and pressure cookers. Throw them all away and just get this! It makes the best hard (or soft!) boiled eggs, pot roast, soup, meats, etc. You won't be disappointed. I use it nearly every day. It is way easier to clean than my crockpot or pressure cooker. I also recommend buying the glass lid for this, I think it is $11 on Amazon. The other day I was cooking acorn squash and after 20 minutes or so, it started beeping and said ""burn"" on the display. This message didn't come in my quick guide, so I Googled it, and found out that the Instant Pot is smart enough to know when something is burning- so it lowers the temperature of the pot until it is safe to release. I had my acorn squash on the steam rack, and couldn't figure out why it would be burning, so I assumed this was a malfunction of some kind and started prepping to return my Instant Pot. Lo and behold, when I opened the pot 10 minutes later, I saw one of the halves had turned over and some squash-y goodness had seeped out to the bottom of the pot and it certainly LOOKED like it was about to burn. After removing my squash (which was PERFECTLY cooked, despite the burn notice), I quickly ran it under water and the brown spot on the bottom of the pan immediately came off. I was floored. If you have a pressure cooker, then you know there is a HUGE possibility of having it sit in the sink to sit for a few days to get off charred bits. I think my pressure cooker STILL has some residual burn marks on it. I am beyond pleased with the Instant Pot. I didn't think I would love anything more than my pressure cooker, but this thing did it. It's also great for Paleo/Whole30 diets, which my family sticks to 80% of the time. Also, unlike my pressure cooker, I haven't had any issues with the seal in the Instant Pot. I feel like I was constantly adjusting the seal on that sucker. Another big bonus is this guy is electric, and unlike my stovetop pressure cooker, this frees up my stovetop and sort of gives me an extra burner. I was hesitant on which size to get. When I called my mom for advice, she said, ""I've never wanted a smaller dish before. I have only ever wished I grabbed a bigger one."" and boy that is the truth. Also keep in mind, that if you do high-pressure cooking, you can't fill it all the way up to the top, so I recommend getting the 8 qt one. If you already have a pressure cooker, you will immediately fall in love- the process is very much the same. If you haven't ever cooked with a pressure cooker before, you might need to give it a few meals before you make any judgments. Quit stalking it and buy it already! This thing is legit amazeballs and I am sorry I didn't buy one sooner."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This review is for my Instant Pot IP-DUO60. The IP-DUO60 is a little powerhouse machine. It functions as a pressure cooker, a slow cooker, a steamer, and so much more. This is my first pressure cooker so I wasn’t sure of how easy it would be to use, time settings, and what you can and can’t cook. I have had a hard time writing this review because how much I love it. I can’t decide which is the best features to tell you about. So I will just go with everything I have done so far with it.Rice is 12 minutes to cook, Veggies are 3-4 to steam from fresh. You can even put frozen chicken in the pressure cooker and it will be ready in roughly 20 min. No more thawing out chicken.The crock pot function is awesome too. I freezer cook so I can put it in first thing in the morning and I will have dinner ready when I walk through the door. But why is the IP-DUO60 different than a normal crock pot?  You can set it to come on an hour (or more) after you walk out the door and it won’t sit on warm for 2 hours and be overcooked! It will just be finishing up when you get home. (I only do this if it is still totally frozen – NEVER with thawed raw meat)Pros:• 7 tools in 1 - Pressure Cooker, Slow Cooker, Rice Cooker, Saute/Browning, Yogurt Maker, Steamer & Warmer• Stainless Steel removable interior pot• Locking lid with Pressure valve.Cons:• At this time, I have not found a con to report. I will come back an update my review accordingly if the need arises.Final Words:I have put my crock pot up for special occasions now (things that are too large to go in the Instant Pot). I love the multi functionality of the Instant Pot. You can brown your meat right in the pot before slow cooking. LESS MESS is BEST! I am continuing to use the Instant Pot and learning about everything this machine can do. But what I do know, it will stay with me for a long time!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,1st time having a pressure cooker. So far easy to use & clean. Definitely love the size & help cut back time on cooking. This 8Qt is a definitely must have especially if you're feeding a family of 4 or more
5.0 out of 5 stars,"If you are on the fence about buying this, allow me to persuade you to join Team Instant Pot!This made the perfect gift for my mother's birthday, and soon after, I had to buy one for myself too!This thing is amazing! I cooked a huge shoulder cut pot roast in an hour and a half yesterday, and the potatoes, carrots, and celery were done in 10 minutes! That normally takes 6-8 hours in my slow cooker, so the time definitely was an improvement. What I didn't expect was the flavor difference! After cooking the meat and veggies, I took the remaining broth, added some butter, and reduced it with the Saute setting, which made a delicious sauce to drizzle over the final product. You won't be disappointed with this purchase!"
1.0 out of 5 stars,Honestly why people are so obsessively buying it or may be they are paying blog writers to promote and influence. I must say this is all hype and rather using simple pressure cooker lot easy better and cheap too just half price. It might be good idea to have time sensor program but just very bulky complex difficult leaking. Real life use is limited. Unless you want a fancy cooker buy it else just buy a simple cooker put alarm in mobile and that’s it.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"My friend recommended the Instant Pot to me, and I was eager to buy it since I HATE to cook. My husband was annoyed at me for purchasing what he thought was another gadget. Well, he gave it a try and is addicted to using it! We use it about 4-5 times a week and how easy! We threw fresh asparagus on the rack, covered it with raw shrimp with Cajun spice and 2 minutes later (yes 2!) out came the most beautiful dinner ever! We even made a cheesecake with the instant Pot which is one of my favorite uses! Highly recommend for people who hate to cook or like to get creative but have no time. You can even put frozen meats in it! It just adds a few minutes more to the cooking time! Hint; I look up recipes online and videos. They are everywhere now!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I debated and debated on getting an instapot. I heard and read all the horror stories. Let me just say I am so happy I bought it! On those days when I forget to pull something out for dinner, I know I can still make a pot roast ( 3lbs frozen) in less than 2 hours! So instead of ordering or picking something up that’s unhealthy I can still make my family an amazing meal! It’s been a life saver! Just make sure you read and follow user directions and you will be just fine!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"We were skeptical about getting this since we had a Crock Pot slow cooker, but since we got this, all of our scratch made (and we're proud to say scratch made) dishes tastes better and are cooked to perfection. The settings and having a timer for each is awesome. The statue feature is great too, it's like cooking on stove top but once you're done, put the lid on and let the device do its job. Comes with a nice cooking manual to try different things and easy to read and follow instructions. Recommend this item!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I had this in my cart for over a year while I researched it, read reviews, talked with folks who had them. I finally took the plunge and I'm sad I missed out on a year of a great appliance.One of the best features is when I do a roast. Let me preface with I do not like how a roast comes out in a crockpot. All meat done in a crockpot is done to death, soggy and shreds. I want a roast that is quick, gives me clean slices and this delivers. A great feature is before you cook your roast, you typically have to brown it on all sides in a pan on the stove. But with the instant pot you can brown in the pot itself, add onions cook them down a bit, deglaze then put your roast back in. Cook the designated time and follow the instructions for quick release or normal release (which is basically letting the meat rest in the pot while the pressure comes down as the heat is off so you don't lose all your juices and flavor) and you'll have a fantastic piece of meat.Eggs - I live in a rural area and we are very water conservative. I always hate having to use so much water to hard boil eggs. I did a dozen eggs in 1 cup of water. Put them in, set it to low pressure for a time of 5 min and you have hard boiled eggs. And they peel wonderfully, even the very fresh eggs.Yogurt - I've made my own yogurt for a couple of years now. Yes I'm a snob now. The yogurt comes out wonderful! The only thing I do not do is the initial heating of the milk. I do that in the microwave because you can get some scorching on the bottom and a skin on the top. So once I heat it I pour into the instant pot itself and place the inner pot into a bowl with ice to cool it down to 110 degrees, add my culture and put the pot back in and set the yogurt time for 11 hours. I do strain for about 30 min when done and it's perfect!Chicken - I've done hot wings, chicken thighs (bone in) and chicken breasts. One thing consistent, the skin on the chicken never cooks up right to me. It's aways rubbery. On the wings I had to put the wings into the broiler to brown them up and crisp the skin. So I only do skinless chicken now.Stock - Save those chicken bones and veggie pieces in your freezer as you prepare meals thru the month and then you can make a fast and very good stock.Cook Delay Feature - This is great! I had a roast that I had marinating and as we all know, let your meat come up to room temp a bit before cooking. This roast needed to sit out about 45 min before cooking. So I put it in the pot with the whole red potatoes and set the delay. Worked like a charm. And I should touch on how quite the unit is. You'll hear a beep when it comes to pressure and starts the cooking process and a series of beeps when it's complete.Do keep in mind it's a heavy heat appliance so some might not be able to run the microwave, the instant pot and have their fridge all going at once and not pop a fuse.Would I buy this again - YesWould I recommend this product to friends and family - Yes.If I could change one thing what would it be? - Have a cord lock on the back of the unit so if you move the instant pot while it's cooking the cord doesn't, A - short itself or B - pop out.Edited - Forgot to add - be sure to download the InstantPot app. Some great ideas in there."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I didn't even know this existed until a coworker told me about it. I can't cook worth a damn and have tried many times over the past couple decades. I use to think I was a lost cause. I'm not exaggerating, sadly. I used this a couple times and each time the food came out so yummy! I was surprised especially because I've even used a crockpot n the past and managed to mess that up somehow. So when this came out yummy, I was taken back. I thought maybe it was just luck the first time around but sure enough each attempt thereafter came out with great results! I am no longer a lost cause when it comes to cooking! I am giving this to my sister and buying a 6qt one so I can make leftovers! I definitely recommend this product!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I use my Instant pot all of the time. I love the extra space over my other old 6 qt pressure cooker. I even poured water in without the inner pot. (Don;t recommend) This was about a couple days after I got it and thought I ruined it. I thought the inner pot was in and wasn't paying attention. I unplugged it. Dumped any residual water out. Unscrewed the bottom and dried it out with a hair dryer. Most of the water went straight through the bottom. Being impatient I did not let it dry out for a couple days. I was back in business about a half hour later after blow drying it out thoroughly. Food comes out great. Made some stuffed peppers in 3 minutes with some leftover taco meat from the night before. Put some cheese on, put lid back on to let it melt and they came out awesome! Added some sour cream and we were eating good. I mostly cook and my wife loves everything that comes out of our Instant Pot. Would recommend. Tons of recipes and accessories but you probably already know about that. It does take noticeably longer to heat up than our other 6 qt pressure cooker but that is to be expected. I bought this one because of the reviews and the stainless inner pot. Transitioning from non stick. Now all we use is stainless and cast iron. Definitely recommend this pressure cooker. I was worried after reading many reviews and they received dented models. Ours came without a blemish and we are extremely happy. It has earned a place on our counter."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Marvelous cooker.  Only way it could be better is it came with a cook.  We were looking for one of these after getting one from our daughter a couple of years ago.  She liked it so we thought we'd give it a try.  Met all of our expectations and then some.  The cookbook is a little limited, but there are thousands of recipes on the internet.  Saved over $30 than from a big box store.  Great device for quickly making great meals."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I previously had a similar item, just different brand, and I absolutely loved the convenience! In December, my husband accidentally destroyed the lid to it and unfortunately I couldn’t replace that exact one due to availability. Ok then, I had to adjust to traditional cooking methods again. Um, no. So FINALLY I purchased the Instant Pot Duo Nova. O.M.G.! I LOVE this thing! The auto seal is probably my favorite feature so far. I can’t tell you how many times I’d forget to “seal” before walking away. Anywho, I’m pretty sure I’m going to end up burning this thing out. I just got it Yesterday & spent the day making Mac & Cheese, 2batches of veggie broth, refried beans, black beans & mashed potatoes (all for the freezer). I’ll be doing more today and give it a rest for a day or two (maybe). Hands down, one of the very best purchases I’ve made."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I am lax in writing reviews--I always have good intentions but my follow through is lousy. However, I love the Instant Pot so much I had to take the time to write this review.I had a stove top pressure cooker but I was always so scared of it that I ended up giving it away.  I have had the Instant Pot for about a month now and it has quickly become a staple in my kitchen. It has saved us money, actually, as all those times when my husband would say ""Oh, let's just order out"", I have been able to whip up a quick meal in the Instant Pot. I love that I can saute ingredients directly in the pot and then add the remaining ingredients and either pressure cook or slow cook depending on my schedule for the day (spaghetti sauce is slow cooking in the Pot as I write this). The Pot takes steel cut oats to a whole new level. I make a batch about twice a week and my hubby, who absolutely loathes oatmeal, happily devours this for breakfast. Yesterday, I made broccoli cheese soup--yum!I have not tried the yogurt maker yet, but I am excited about that as I have two Dalton type yogurt makers with the individual cups. I rather prefer the idea of making one big batch in the Instant Pot. I also have heard that risotto is very good (and way less time consuming) made in the Instant Pot, so that is also on my list of things to try. I like the fact that the inner pot is stainless steel--I am not a big fan of the non stick stuff. I do wish that the see-through lid that is used for slow cooking was included, but, oh well, I needed it, so I bought it anyway. The Pot does take up a significant amount of counter space (for me, anyway, as my counter space is limited.) but I tend to leave it out on the counter, anyway, as I use it so often! I have already recommended this product to many people and I look forward to getting rid of many of my small kitchen appliances as this product does the job of so many!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"It was tricky to get started because the booklet really isn't all that helpful, but there is a ton of information (and recipes) available on line.  My daughters and I all love our Instant Pots.  Pasta, stews & soups, potatoes & sweet potatoes and other veggies, defrosting and warming up frozen meals, the pressure cooker function, the slow cooker function, the sauté function; it's all good.  So easy.  And easy to clean, too, even when I burned food on the bottom (because I wasn't following the directions for defrosting food).  Perfect pasta, every time, without standing over the pot to watch how it's doing. I love it!"
1.0 out of 5 stars,"Despite the IP Lux was not specifically listed as compatible, I found that it worked!  I think it was operator error that made me dis this product.  I even went so far as to buy a new IP, but when I retried the lid with my Lux, I found that it worked!  I took the other IP back."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I hate leaving kitchen products out on the counter -BUT this never leaves it! I use this damned thing for so much of my cooking now! I was terrified of pressure cookers - my mothers fault from the scary stove top one she had when I was little, and ran out of the kitchen when I first testing this, but dang! use it all of the time! Great food comes out of that thing! Recommend it to anyone and have gifted it to a few!"
4.0 out of 5 stars,"I really wanted to like this but felt it was a big waste of my money and kitchen space to store.Pros:-Works well with my Instant Pot.  ( Love my Instant Pot and well worth money and space)-Easy to clean-Easy to operate-Good for one person-Food turned out well, just very small portionsCons:-Size for storage, you wouldn't leave this out on your counter-Basket for food is way too small-Pictures on the web site show huge plates of food.  (You would have to cook in several batches to accomplish this)-You can purchase a full size air fryer for about the same price-If you have convection on your large oven or a toaster oven, it cooks the same way, the food taste the same and you can cook as much as you want."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Nicely made.  Good control layout.  Clever design of steam control system.  My only complaint is the user's manual.  It's okay, but I have had questions about several of the settings that I could not answer from the manual.  I have been able to answer my questions by experimenting, however.  I have noticed that after using it about 5 times, I have a couple of small pits on the inside of the stainless steel pot.  Hopefully, this is merely cosmetic and not a sign of a failing s.s. coating.It makes cheerful noises.  At the moment, we are using it to sterilize baby bottles more often than we are for making meals. It's very convenient as a bottle sterilizer, but be aware that you may need to choose ""low pressure"" for the ""steam"" setting so that the temperature doesn't damage plastic bottles.  A web search reveals that a lot of people has discovered this use for the Instant Pot.  I suppose other items needing sterilization could be processed in this way.Be aware that the plastic measuring cup that comes with it is designed for measuring rice and is coordinated with the markings on the side of the pot.  It is NOT a one-cup measure.  Apparently, this minor weirdness has to do with its origin as a rice cooker."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This oneis small enough to leave on counter and use regularly. I’ve used it several times and am very pleased with the results and ease of use. It makes some bangin pulled pork. Indian food, soups, stews, carnitas."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I am a 22 year old male that frequents the gym so I make most of my meals ahead of time for the week. I AM OBSESSED WITH THIS THING. I literally go through my fridge and go ""hmm, that will fit in the pot"" and throw it in. BOOM, in 3/4 of the time whatever I through in the pot with a metric ton of season comes out delicious.I'm vegan so I wanted to make a vegan chili. Have I ever made one before? No. Did I have a recipe? No. Threw 4 cans of beans, veggies, and wild rice up in this pot with sugar, spice, and a can of crushed tomatoes and veggie broth. I now have enough chili to feed the entirety of the Swiss army while everyone in my lab at work asks for the recipe.Cooked a whole chicken in this too, cuz I could."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I use this primarily to make soups, particularly bean soup. It works great and the soups are delicious.  My only complaint is that the cooking times listed in the accompanying recipe book do not match the times listed on the Instant Pot Web page.  Many Instant Pot recipes listed on the web have cooking times that are not consistent.  I've made bean soup 6 or 8 times and zeroed in a a good cooking time based on trial and error.  I cooked a pork loin based on a web recipe.  It came out ok, but I think it was way overcooked.  So I need to read more recipe books and get more experience with using it.  In spite of these small issues it's still great.  I love the fact that you can set it and forget it until cooking is completed.  I have the six quart model which has a useful capacity of 80% or 4.8 quarts or so.  There are 2 of us in the family.  I make 4 qts of soup at a time and freeze some for later.  For bean soup I can fit about 1-1.3 pounds of beans max plus meat and diced vegetables in the pot. Sometimes I run out of capacity so I can see where having the 8 qt model would be more useful if you like to make larger batches.  But with the 6 qt model I can make batches quickly as needed and do not need to make a huge batch to freeze."
3.0 out of 5 stars,"The first instant pot that I ordered was defective and was returned to Amazon. Amazon was great in dealing with this return. The yogurt feature on the first instant pot would not hold a proper temperature. I talked to the manufacturer and they said that the unit was defective.  (I wasted a half gallon of milk and a lot of time on it.)  The second instant pot worked perfectly. I have not tried anything other than the yogurt feature so far since I just got the pressure cooker yesterday.  Please note, the reason I am giving the instant pot three stars is because the manual that comes with the unit had limited directions.  I had to spend way too much time trying to figure out how to use it.  With so many features, the manual should give explicit directions for each function.  There is an online manual that is more detailed and helped quite a bit at the Instant Pot website.  I purchased a SS Presto  pressure cooker last year from Amazon.  Since I have used a pressure cooker for many years, I probably will stick with the Presto cooker most of the time.  I cannot see how the instant pot will really save that much time."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I swear, we’ve used this thing daily for the past month (and will continue to use it multiple times a week from now on). It’s amazing and does a great job cooking a wide variety of meals. I got the larger one and glad I did (family of four good eaters). Have to add in the time it takes for the pot to build pressure (all depends on amount/type of liquid used in recipe), but it’s still MUCH quicker than stovetop or crockpot cooked meals. The meats cooked in this thing are literally infused with flavor (keep that in mind when seasoning meals, don’t go overboard) and it’ll break down the toughness making any cut/type of meat tender."
1.0 out of 5 stars,"Since I bought this in November 2018, I have used this only about 6 times, because of disastrous results. Then I get the idea to try it again.  All but one time I have had burn warnings and once it way over cooked an expensive beef roast (by taking forever to seal and basically boiling the roast)! I’m following the Instant Pot recipes and instructions to the “T” but I am about done with this hunk of junk. My daughter has an Instant Pot and has never had a problem so I’m starting to think possibly my Instant Pot is defective."
2.0 out of 5 stars,"I was very excited to get one of these, but after using my 6 quart unit multiple times, I'm disappointed. It takes 20 to 30 minutes to just START the (cooking) countdown. That 20 to 30 minutes is just the 'warm up' time. Many recipes also want to use a natural release of the pressure (15 minutes +/_?) after the cooking period which also adds to the cooking time. This is the farthest tool for anything fast. Not impressed. I'll give it credit for cooking a boneless turkey breast to come out nice and juicy."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I would never have purchased this but a friend told me how much his parents liked their ""Instant Pot"".  After doing some online research I decided to purchase one and try it.  There are some things to learn about right at first (especially concerning the steam release - hence only four stars for safety features), but once I got the steps down it was very easy to use and really speeds up meal preparation. Versatility is provided by a ""saute"" feature that allows for browning meats before adding the other ingredients for the final one-pot meal.  Has many of the advantages of a crock pot but is MUCH faster.  I love it and consider it first when I am preparing a meal for my family."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"So, I was def the one saying I didn’t need another gadget in the kitchen... but let me tell u, this little baby is like a magic wand for plant-based cooking! Cooks any un-soaked bean in under 30min, delicious Indian dal in 20 and the perfect rice and quinoa in under 5min! Throw in dry pinto beans, a half an onion and a couple of garlic cloves in water and u will have the creamiest frijoles de la Hoya you have ever eaten. Love that it is small, but is perfect for 2-4 servings, fitting up 2 cups of most rice or beans comfortably. I love my Instantpot!"
4.0 out of 5 stars,"It's a great product.  It performs as it should.  It is not difficult to clean.  The inner stainless pot is a good quality heavy gauge stainless and easy to clean.  It does not add heat to your kitchen.  It does take a good bit of space in the cabinet.  Buy extra seals because the seal will absorb and retain odors of food, so have one for meats and spicy foods, and another for items you cook such as desserts.  There are so many videos on line on how to use these that learning how is no problem.  Will you use it a lot?  Do you have space for another cooking appliance?  These are questions to answer for yourself.  It did not make my pot roast any more tender and moist than cooking in a slow cooker or in my cast iron Dutch oven in the stove, and I had thought pressure cooking would make it more moist and tender.  I don't boil eggs any more.  I steam them in this and they peel perfectly.  I had a gift certificate from my daughters and I bought the 8 qt. one because it was the one on sale with the semi annual Amazon Prime sale, and I do like having leftovers for the freezer.  I have not bought accessories yet.  They are pricey.  I happened to have a stainless steamer pan that fits inside, but the stacking pan inserts might be useful.  A wire rack comes with the pot that can be used to lift food above the level of the liquid if needed.  At this point I do not call it a must have;  and I don't use it daily.  Anything I have cooked in it, I have another way to cook it that is very good, though maybe not as fast, but it's a very nice product.  It can slow cook, saute, steam, cook rice, and some people bake in it too.  I have not yet baked a dessert in it, and I'm trying to plan more ways to use it.  I started a Pinterest board on Instant Pot Pressure Cooking as many others have done, so a lot of recipes and tips are available there for you to use.2020 update.  It is a great appliance.  I do not like it for pot roast (beef) because it comes out tough.  It's great for perfect-every-time boiled eggs, soups, stews, chili, wonderful for dried beans, and one pot meals.  Though the seal does retain a bit of odor, the odor has never transferred to anything else I have cooked, so I do not bother to change the seal.  I have an extra if ever needed.  I store the lid upside down on top of the pot inside a cabinet so it can air out.  I am glad I purchased the 8 quart, even though I cook for two people.  It works fine for small amounts as well as large amounts.  I like to make soups in it in quantity and freeze in zip lock bags."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I was looking for something that would make weeknight cooking easier (and more appealing) when my boyfriend switched to 3rd shift and I took over cooking dinner. This thing is really awesome and gets used several times a week!! It's definitely not ""instant"" but it's great if you're looking for cooking that is less hands-on and allows you to get stuff done in the meantime. The saute function is a huge game changer, and cooking times are SO much shorter than with other methods like slow-cooker, oven, broiling, etc. Meat can come out so tender, and there are so many recipes out there that can make an entire meal one-pot style. I even bought a second smaller one to prepare side dishes with if my main one had only meat in it! Definitely got my money's worth, best purchase I've made in awhile. The 6-qt is the perfect size for my bf and I, we always have plenty of leftovers for work the next day too."
5.0 out of 5 stars,This pot is Absolutely amazing and I use it almost every day!  For the person who is busy with a little time to cook this is for you. Healthy meal right at home in 30 minutes or less. Love to do butternut and spaghetti squash in this. It used to take me an hour and a half now it takes me 20 minutes.Love love love thanks Amazon once again
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Today is the first day I used my Instant Pot.I spent 2 days reading the manual before I dared try it..been a long time since I had a pressure cooker.I made butternut squash and apple soup..prep time took longer than cooking time and the results were exactly what I hoped for...a fast lunch and more to freeze for a couple more meals.I ordered a couple of cookbooks for the Instant Pot and am looking forward to Indian food at home.I originally just wanted another rice cooker and vegetable steamer and bought this by accident.  When my daughter saw it (It's really large) she asked why I bought such a big one as I cook for myself.  This was on special and I didn't check it our sufficiently, but now i""m goad I got the bigger one.The container works fine with fewer raw food ingredients than a larger family would use.I love that its a crock pot,  along with being a vegetable steamer, pressure cooker and rice maker  as mine broke and I never replaced it even though I made a lot of crock pot meals.Well worth the price.  And if you are thinking of the smaller one..reconsider and go big.  I can fit 5-6 ears of fresh corn into this to steam."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"the cooker was such a great item to add in the kitchen. we use it daily for rice, porridge, soup, sauté, etc... the stainless steel makes it extremely easy to clean, the rubber seal is easily removed to clean, the programmed settings have delivered many great meals and the ability to find a large amount of recipes in the app and online with time and pressure settings is a big plus, far better then what we expected it to do"
3.0 out of 5 stars,A lot has been said about this product. I waited too long. I haven’t mastered it yet. I still need to try all the functions but I am looking forward to that.

However the insert started to peel and bubble up so I am disappointed as I have been using it lightly so really they should not paint it in the first place

   This was not functioning from day one. When sealed it was spitting out water the whole time. A friend also had this issue and never uses the pressure feature. Customer service is a nightmare. They were incompetent and rude."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've been using my Instant Pot for a week now and love it! After considering buying one for a year and then deciding to take the plunge on Black Friday, I am not disappointed with my purchase. I read many of the reviews before deciding to buy and the reviews are very helpful. I had planned to buy the 6 quart but the 8 quart Duo was on sale on Black Friday so that's what I bought. I'm glad I have the bigger size. As the reviews say, the instant pot does not prepare the foods instantly but it's very quick compared to many other cooking methods. It takes 10-20 min for the pot to come to pressure before it starts cooking the food (depends on how much liquid the recipe calls for). Once the cooking starts, it's fast for most things (3-20 min for the items I've made so far). There are some recipes that take longer- all depends on what you're making. Two of my biggest takeaways are: 1) buy multiple sealing rings. The sealing rings will take on the smells of the spices you cook with. I have a sealing ring for savory items (recipes using cumin, chili powder, garlic, etc.), 'sweet' items (like applesauce), and one for Indian recipes (which would be savory but I decided to designate one specifically for that type of food). I just ordered 2 more rings because I want to have a separate ring for savory recipes that don't use the spices I listed (ex chicken soup and vegetables).  2) Join some sort of beginners group on social media. I've found this so helpful. People post the recipes they use as well as questions. I would highly recommend this product!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Oh my, my, my. I've only had this for about 2 weeks and am loving it ! So far I have made brown rice, lime chicken, Cuban black beans - and for the first time ever in my life - yogurt, several cheesecakes & lemon curd.  The buttons are easy to use and the instruction manual is easy to follow. I have had an electric pressure cooker (EPC) for several years and it has been great. But what I have found is that the EPC only has 1 temperature and only a 60 minute max cooking time. What I love about the Instant Pot (IP) is the versatility in choice of cooking styles and extended cooking times. But what really sold me and make me buy this IP, was the stainless steel inner pot - for health reasons. Be sure to check out the extra accessories that are available to use in your IP (such as spring form pan, strainer basket, sealing rings, silicon egg molds, glass lid, etc) as they will enhance & expand your IP experience. I definitely have recommended this product to several friends and it's just a matter of time before I wear them down :)  I know there are so many things I want to make and know that my IP will definitely be put to good use. Now will I ever use my original EPC ? Probably. But sadly it has been become a 2nd pressure cooker whenever I need one. That is, unless I add another IP to my arsenal. <3"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"A great addition to my kitchen. The 3 quart size is just right for one or two people with a plethora of features, slow cooker, pressure cooker, steamer etc. It makes the greatest fluffiest rice I have ever made. I also ordered the ceramic pot for those important non-stick jobs. The stainless steel and/or ceramic pots with lid can be placed right in the refrigerator without having to be concerned with the food leaching from teflon coating.However, the first InstaPot arrived with the vent knob loose and the replacement arrived without a power cord. I managed to locate an extra power cord that I had in a drawer thus having not to return it for the second time."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I ordered this Instant Pot DUO 7 in 1 after reading a lot of reviews and hearing from others how they like theirs.  I was as concerned as others thinking of the thought of a pressure cooker and how it could ""blow up""....rest assured it won't!!  They are not the pressure cooker your mother or grandmother had.  There are so many safety features built into it  It isn't only a pressure cooker but it is a slow cooker, rice cooker, there is a bean setting, one for soup, one for meats, for poultry,  steamer, yogurt maker, porridge, multigrain,  etc.  It preserves and seals in the nutrients that you want to keep in your food.Hands down....the greatest kitchen appliance ever!  I received this 2 days ago and cooked a stew from start to finish in under an hour, an almost 8 lb. turkey breast this morning in 1/2 hour and a full rack of meat falling off the bone ribs tonight in 30 minutes and also made my own turkey stock from the turkey this morning.  It is phenomenal!  It allows you to cook a healthy meal in a minimal amount of time.  Who would have thought turkey could cook in 1/2 hour?  You can even make cheesecakes in it that taste better than if you cooked them in the oven.  Want hard boiled eggs?  Put them in there and steam them.  Steamed vegetables take no time at all also.It is a very sleek stainless steel design with black appliance with digital readings and buttons for all the functions.  The inner pot is stainless steel with a reinforced bottom that heats the food faster.  Cleanup is a breeze with the pot.I would suggest when you buy it to buy an extra silicone ring just to have on hand."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I own two and have bought at least three more as gifts. I like the 3 quart size for smaller meals and I bought extra stainless steel pots to go inside so I can cook multiple things. You can get steamer baskets as well. Makes a dozen boiled eggs and the skins peel off like magic, for that alone its worth it. You can pressure cook chicken wings before finishing them in the oven, best ever. The leftover broth can be frozen in ice cube trays for soups and noodles. Cooks perfect rice. Allows cooking fish or chicken from frozen, less germs. I love it. I did make a cheese cake in it once, but desserts not my favorite thing."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love the instant pot. I was skeptical - could it be that good? Usually any product that people are raving over is disapointing but man do I love our instant pot! We enjoy cooking Indian cuisine and the IP makes it a breeze. I can have a biriyani ready in 40 minutes! The possibilities are endless. I've made custards, ribs, roasts, all in one rice dishes, stews, pasta and all are quick and easy. Most recently I cooked ribs to fall off the bone tender in the IP then smoked them on the grill for 30 minutes before carmelizing them on the flame with the sauce. I will cook ribs this way from now on. They tasted just like the 5 hour babysitting mutli-step ribs."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased this several months to a year ago I am not sure exactly when. Since I could not get the 6-quart version at the time or there was a several week waiting list, I went with the 8-quart version. I am a single person and still I feel that the 8-quart is just fine for me. I'm glad to have the extra capacity if needed. So far I do not feel at all that I have gone wrong with this purchase. Also on the popular social media site that most of you probably spend a lot of time in every day there are more than one group of support. Lots of good recipes and I especially enjoy the Wendy's copycat chili recipe myself. I have made that several times over the year and it is great every time. If you want to make it extra-special look around and see if you can find some of that McCormick's Smokey barbecue flavor Chilli seasoning stuff in a bag. It's hard to find so you usually just have to go with the regular but it's a real treat if you find it."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I was really intimidated by these at first but after my friend cooked with it, I had to have it. All the buttons make it seem much more difficult but it is actually super easy to use. I love everything I have made with this thing so far. It makes perfect hard boiled eggs that are easy to peel and any meat I've tried falls off the bone with tenderness. The pot itself is easy to clean, the lid is kind of a pain because of all the little gadgets you have to remove but it's well worth it."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"Possibilities with this instapot are endless.  Simple to use.  Set it and pretty much forget it.  Unless your unit was one of the ones that got recalled for fire hazards...Product itself is pretty good.  Customer service is absolutely horrid.  My unit was missing several pieces when I purchased it several months ago.  It almost looked like a refurbished unit that had been repackaged.  After multiple emails and attempted phone calls to get the parts that I was missing, I just finally gave up.  Last time I'll be spending any money with this company through Amazon."
1.0 out of 5 stars,"When we first got this it says burn and doesn’t pressure cook.  We did the troubleshooting in the book, which nothing is clogged and still can’t use it. Don’t buy it!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"We LOVE our instant pot! Use it all the time, is perfect for last minute dinner makers like me... who forget to thaw meat 😜 Also great for making a lot of food and freezing or meal prepping. We have made a lot of yummy recipes and it cooks meat so tender. I feel very safe using this pressure cooker with the safety features. We do put a dish towel over the steam vent though so it doesn’t accidentally spray hot mist or harm our cabinet finish."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"To be specific, it lasted 4 years, 3 months, 24 days of continuous use before getting the dreaded ""C6"" error indicating the pressure sensor was failing.We have used this for making awesome pasta sauce, chili, soup, quinoa, cheesecake, and rice just as a start.  It was perfect for large dinner parties where we were cooking multiple dishes at the same time.  Literally it was ""set and forget"" and, as long as we followed the recipes, we were rarely disappointed.The day this gave up the ghost, we got another one.Easy to use and easy to clean."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Where has this been my whole life?!? I originally got it for my Korean mom. Her rice cooker broke and those boogers are expensive (the good ones anyways). I figured she could use this as a rice cooker. She left it in the box for months and eventually got a new rice cooker. Did I mention I am a horrible cook? So, my chef husband does most (pretty much all) of the cooking. However, once I braved the instant pot, I was hooked! My 4 year old actually asked for steamed broccoli for a snack (he’s such a picky eater) and I was able to steam them and give it to him before he could change his mind! So fast and easy. I’m still a recipe cooker, but the possibilities are endless. If I can use this, ANYONE can use this. It’s so fast! Did I mention less mess? Most recipes I’ve tried call for you to sauté in the Instant Pot and add everything else directly into the pot before pressure cooking. Bonus kudos for that!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"We foolishly avoided these for years because they seemed to have such a cult following of people who thought they were the best thing since sliced bread.  Generally such an evangelical fan base is a bad sign of something that will be here today and gone tomorrow.  Turns out that was a mistake, these are truly useful and versatile devices.  We make about two thirds of all our meals with this now, and things we'd never considered before such as yoghurt become trivial.  Highly recommended."
1.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased this in August of 2015 and in August of 2016, it died.  Just 1 week past the warranty period.  How do they set that up to happen?  I am really disappointed in the quality of this, especially at the original cost of it.  I am not a heavy user.  I found that the pressure cooker feature really takes much longer than they claim, since there is a pressure build up time and a pressure release time that is added to the cooking time.  I have had slow cookers at much less cost that have lasted 20 years without any failures.  I'll be going back to a good slow cooker."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Quality stainless steel product, making healthy cooking easy and yet tasty!Soup cooked with this is very rich in flavor and tasty.Love cooking salmon with this.Tips:- place 3 - 4 tomatoes slices on a oven-safe container, sprinkle with salt- place the salmon on top of the tomato slices, sprinkle salmon with salt- add a little oil in a bowl with chopped garlic and microwave to brown it (not too much), then pour the oil and garlic on top of the salmon- add 1 cup of water to the inner pot and place the steam rack which comes with the instant pot in the inner pot- place the oven-safe container on top of the steam rack- use Pressure cook button, for 4 minutes- natural releaseThe salmon will be cooked just right and yet tasty!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I initially began my search looking for a rice cooker.  we wanted to try making sushi at home and one of the things I read just about everywhere I looked was that buying a dedicated machine to preparing the rice would not only result in better and more consistent sushi rice but would make it easier and faster to do and this something we would likely do more often.  After looking at dedicated rice cookers in the $100 price range I kept seeing the Instant Pot line come up in various discussions.  While I was aware of traditional pressure cookers (i.e. heated by your range) I was not aware of these modern electric designs that offer most (slightly less psi) of the benefits of the old school pressure cookers with modern conveniences such as preset timers and a lot of safety devices.  After doing a bit of research I decided to spend a little more in the hopes that the IP would meet my rice cooker needs and then offer me an entire new way to cook (that seemed to be the promise at least).  After about a month and having made sushi rice, brown rice, and trying other recipes our household is absolutely in love with our Instant Pot.  Rice is a simple affair of just measuring, setting, and forgetting.  We started out with really basic recipes (i.e frozen chicken and salsa) and are now getting into more complex recipes that incorporate the instant pot in addition to other cooking methods.  The IP has officially taken over what used to be our Sous Vide bucket spot which has at least for the moment been demoted to pantry status!  It really is amazing how many things once can prepare with next to zero prep and active involvement.  With a one year old running around our house, any meal that we can prepare so hands off is a meal we can get behind!  Highly recommended."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I was so skeptical when I purchased this...Specially because before buying the instant pot I did the horrible mistake of buying a Farberware  pressure cooker (from WalMart) which is HORRIBLE... programs are bad  instructions manual is useless... ended up selling  to buy the instant pot and no regrets on that!! super easy to use it, lots options, quick meals... White rice was done after 12 minutes!I made a pork loin rost with potatoes and turned out amazing!!!!It's really worth having this pressure cooker!!!!I would definitely buy it again"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Loving the Instant Pot. Irish Lamb Stew was a huge hit (pressure cooker), slow-cooked turkey breast held its flavor and juices amazingly well, rice and pasta is simply fast and easy. Consistent with other reviews, the slow cooker is a little slower than my crock-pot but not a problem now I know. If you’ve never used one before, the pressure cooker function is unbelievable (but don’t overfill or the quick release will make a massive mess). All the controls are easy. Cleaning the inner pot is easy enough, while the outside has a few tough spots to get completely sparkling.  The smaller size is good for maybe four people, any more mouths to feed and I would get the 6qt version for sure."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"So far, so very good. I have never used a pressure cooker before, but this thing has changed my mind. On the first day, made Brown rice, pork ribs, baked potatoes. Second day made Mac and cheese, white rice, steamed broccoli. Today, planning chicken soup. Unbelievable how fast things cook, food tastes great. There is a bit of a learning curve, especially after using conventional cooking methods for 55 years or more. I just Google recipes and hints and so far, we are really satisfied. I really don't think I needed all the different settings. I have primarily used only the pressure cooker setting so far. I wish I could hear the ""beeps"". Too quiet when it changes after cooking to the keep warm cycle, especially if you need to do a quick release."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I am amazed!! Cooking with this is soooo easy!!! healthy meals quickly. Fall-apart, tender pot roast with vegetables in 1 hour. Meat comes out very tender and the vegetables aren't mushy just firm and cooked. Tender chicken, rice and vegetable dishes in 25 minutes. No added fat or salt needed you only need to add the right combo of veggies to et the taste you'll love.  Meat comes out tender and juicy every time. Only trick for me is how much liquid to add when cooking rice with vegetables and meat. I've found the more vegetables I add, I need less liquid to get the rice just right. clean up is simple. the stainless steel inner cooker is removable and cleans up like it non stick (easy cleanup probably has more to due with the cooking process) Wish I'b bought one of these years ago!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love to have porridge, meat stew, and HOT POT. YES! HOT POT!!! I didn't know the saute function in Instant Pot is that useful until my friend told me! It heats really quick and the 6-quart size for 2 people having hot pot is more than enough! Forget about the Aroma's electric grill & hotpot pan, this works much faster than that! For beef stews, the high pressure meat function works very well (well maybe too good that the meat is almost break to small pieces... Just reduce the pre-set pressure-time if you want juicy meat). I also make soy milk myself, dried soybean are really hard to boil to soft, but with instant pot, just set a delay timer for a night with bean function and directly soak the bean in the pot. Ding! Next morning with blender, I can enjoy the best soymilk! I will highly recommend the pot to others. I use it almost EVERY DAY. LOVE IT!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love it!! This Instant Pot is my first of this brand. I highly recommend this brand because it is the ""standard"" among electric pressure cookers. Having owned a previous ""other brand"", I can say that this one is far superior over the other brands. I've cooked a variety of foods in it, and everything I've cooked has turned out beautifully. I have not found the inside container difficult to clean. After washing in hot soapy water, I put a little bit of water in the bottom, sprinkle it with ""Bar-Keepers Friend powder"" and use a dish cloth to clean the entire inside of the pot. After rinsing and drying, it looks brand new and no scratches at all."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"Though we've had a 12qt stovetop pressure cooker for years, I was always terrified of using it because I was convinced I'd mess up and cause an explosion. While the Instant Pot has significantly less volume, we picked one up because it allows me to assist with making meals without worrying as much. It's been a fantastic item to have around for making stocks, quick meals, and even soft boiled eggs (which I love because I hate making them the standard way -- just use the IP's steam function for 2-3 minutes!).Since the Instant Pot operates at a slightly lower PSI than stovetop pressure cookers, it does require increasing the cooking time slightly to compensate. Thankfully tons of recipes are readily available online that have been adjusted to appropriate cooking times for this device if you don't feel confident about modifying the times yourself.That said, we compared our Duo v2 against our friend's Duo v1 after noticing it seemed like it took a bit to come to pressure and that it was running out of water when making meals unlike with our friend's unit. There are a couple physical differences like the cord and trivet, and they performed at different cooking speeds. We placed into each four eggs straight from the fridge in the accompanying trivet along with a cup of water and set them to steam for two minutes. The v1 got to pressure 31 seconds faster and ultimately finished 45 seconds before the v2. After cooling the eggs in ice baths for about 10 minutes, the results were close enough though the eggs from our v2 were slightly more cooked than the v1.I don't know if this is just our unit or a difference between the v1 and the v2 models, but I would still recommend the Instant Pot for quick, easy, and delicious meals."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Of course I love the Instant Pot — who doesn’t? It was my first pressure cooker, so after I got the hang of how to use a pressure cooker, it was smooth sailing from there. I haven’t done everything possible with my Instant Pot, but I feel like those would be simple enough to do when I try them out. It also comes with a guide on cooking times/instructions for all kinds of meats and vegetables, which is great for you when you’re learning how to use it!My only issue is that the lid itself is a little cumbersome to clean. I don’t think it’s safe to put in the dishwasher so I always hand wash it, but it’s pretty bulky, so I’m always worried about it falling over in my dish rack and breaking. The internal pot is removable and dishwasher safe, which I love. Just remember to regularly clean the silicone seal around the rim and the plastic water collector in the back (both dishwasher safe as well)!"
4.0 out of 5 stars,"I love Instant Pots. I have 3. This is my only 8 qt though. I had high hopes, but it is more difficult to use than my 6 qt. It takes longer to come up to pressure and naturally release pressure than my other two. Also, I get more errors on this one than both of my others (honestly, I can't remember ever getting an error on either of my 6 qt pots). I get the BURN error the most. Part of it might be user error though. I do try to make sure nothing is stuck to the bottom while using the saute function that causes issues. Anyhow, if something fits in the 6qt I always use that one. I only use the 8qt if I need to cook more of something than will fit in the 6qt."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Loving my Instant Pot. I can cook baby back ribs in 30 minutes! Steak and gravy in just 25 minutes and it’s so tender! This is a lifesaver on busy week nights when you have a family to cook for. Easy to clean, you can put the inner pot and lid in the dishwasher. You can sauté meat in the pot before you pressure cook, saving on dirty dishes! It’s a little scary the first time you release the pressure, but you soon get brave about it."

She doesn't use it often, but we tried using it today and it started smelling like an electric circuit board burning... and the cord became very hot.  We unplugged it for safety reasons and will need to follow up with Instant Pot to see if they can send a replacement."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Waited a long time to purchase this because I thought it would be just another big appliance in my kitchen,which is very small. I used it over the holidays to cook large batches of collard greens and it was absolutely amazing! It cooked  them tender  in less than 20 minutes!!! I’m sure I’ll be using it for other items and I’m glad I was able to get it in the smallest 6 quart size vs the 8 quart which was overwhelmingly large!I’ve used pressure cookers for years and love them but what I love most about this one, is i  didn’t have to stand around and manage the pressure to ensure  the pot didn’t explode! it’s a great great I purchase. So much easier to use!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is a very versatile device that is now on it's 3rd (?) iteration from IP. You can tell in the design that they've thought of (almost) everything ... the way the lid can be stored in the side handles, to the drainage arrangement for condensation on the lid. I like that the seals are replaceable, and the front of the unit is easily wiped down.My reason for purchasing the IP was time-savings. I needed the ability to make healthier meals (instead of frying) that were still tasty, but in a compressed window between work and evening kid's activities. This IP allows me to saute (sear, using a tiny bit of olive oil) and pressure cook in the same device. It's awesome! I can make pulled chicken or pulled pork in less than an hour.My only gripe - and it's a small one - is that the steam vent needs the aftermarket silicone 360 degree vent adapters to keep from burning myself, or steaming up my cupboards."
1.0 out of 5 stars,"This is the 3 qt Duo Mini. Very handy for steel cut oats; I've also gotten good results with white rice. But at one year of age it began having explosive decompression: In the middle of cooking phase, there's a BANG and boiling oats are all over the kitchen, and also down the inside of the outer pot where it's very difficult to clean, even though the top is still in place and the pressure valves are intact and clean. First time it happened I supposed the gasket was malpositioned and I started checking it each time. Second time it happened I bought new gaskets from the manufacturer. New gasket blows out as well. Failure is always at the same place in the rim, right behind the valves. Gasket holding ring is intact, no visible distortion of lid or inner pot. Phone call to customer support was useless, waited 30 minutes on hold and never got a rep; this is consistent with others' experience of IP customer support. It seems that Instant Pot is not particularly interested in quality control or customer service."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I am an old bachelor who cooks for myself nearly every night. I am steadily learning new uses for my Instant Pot DUO80 8 Qt pressure cooker. I use it at least a couple of times a week, some weeks more than that, and find that the more I use it, the more I am glad I invested in it. I have found it much easier to cook with  than an ordinary stove-top or electric pressure cooker. and it is certainly more versatile. On the negative side of the ledger, it is not easily cleaned and it took me some time to figure out how to arrange the various parts in a dishwasher. Also,  I have not tried all the pre-set options (e.g., yogurt making) on the Instant Pot but judging on what I have used it for, it probably would do a good job. I like it a lot!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"While I have not begun to use it as much as I like, I love the product.  My first dish was a customized recipe for Chicken Cacciatore based on about 10 instant pot recipes,  I was quite nervous to tell the truth.  The entire process was easy and a total success.  The only change was I learned the difference between a summer recipe and a hunter's recipe...the wine red or white.  I will always use red instead of white.  Our family voted on that.  what took the longest was the prep.  Hubby helped me chop, dice and mince the fresh veggies while I was sauteing in the pot.  We chose the quick cooking instead of 6 to 8 hours.  I have also cooked Chicken and dumplings.  Not my recipe so things our family would change.  But the instant pot was a success in the meal prep and finishing.  We plan to use more as soon something in life allows us to focus on our lifestyle change.  This product is great as a meal manager when you are spending time back and forth at hospital."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I really like using a crock pot, so when my friend introduced me to the Instant Pot & had to get one.  I got it for Christmas & use it a lot.  I love it.  I love that it can be used as a pressure cooker or as a slow cooker, among several other uses.  The food comes out delicious.  I have made many recipes in it that take little time at all.  Definitely a must buy if you love to cook & try new recipes but don't have a lot of time to do it."
3.0 out of 5 stars,This Instant Pot did not come with instructions on how to use it.  The first time I used it I started over six times because I couldn't figure out how to choose the settings.  None of the directions in the box provided me with step by step instructions.  It was a hit and miss with what I wanted to do.  I was making a stew and didn't know whether to use the Meat/Stew setting or the Slow Cook setting.  No where did it state how to use the venting button.  I don't think it even worked because it never had any pressure to it.I was very disappointed in this product.  I wish I had spent the money on an Air Fryer instead.
1.0 out of 5 stars,"Unboxed the Pot and immediately noticed the two dents on both sides of control panel.  I went ahead and did the water test and pushed all buttons to see if they all worked, they did.  Both boxes the unit came in were in perfect condition, so the dents had to have happened before it was boxed up.  I guess the Chinese are trying to get even with American consumers for the trade war. I'll decide in the next day or so whether to return it or try to use it as is.  Right now I'm thinking of returning it.  Right now I think I need to keep further comments to myself."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I use this thing almost every day. I previously owned the 6 qt and have passed that along to my mom so that it stays in the family when I need to make a big pot of something. I'm currently single and the only meat eater in the house, so this 2 qt version is absolutely perfect for me. I often cook a pound of chicken or one cup of rice in it and it's perfect. This weekend I put five pounds of pork shoulder in the thing (it was a tight fit, I admit) and in 2.5 hours I had perfect pulled pork. I am an unrepentant member of the Instant Pot Cult."
2.0 out of 5 stars,"I really liked using this, but within 6 months of purchasing it, the nonstick coating in the basket started to chip away, despite carefully following the use and cleaning guidelines. I contacted Instant Brand’s customer support and asked for a replacement since it was still under warranty, but it’s been months now and they just keep saying that the basket is out of stock and they can’t replace it until it’s back in stock. So, essentially, they aren’t honoring their warrant and I am stuck with a defective product and no refund or replacement."
3.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm not nearly as impressed with this as I hoped I would be.  I hoped it would replace my crock pot and my steamer, but the slow cook function doesn't even get warm enough to boil.The ""wow it only takes ten minutes to make...."" comments are misleading, bc it takes ten minutes to get up to pressure, then ten minutes to cook, then most recipes suggest at least a few minutes natural release.  I also don't trust it enough to walk away while cooking like I do my slow cooker.It makes fantastic hard boiled eggs, though, so if you're looking for the best egg cooker a hundred dollars can buy,  here it is!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is fantastic for everything I make in it, which is basically just yogurt, soup and chili.  Unfortunately, because I got the small pot, I have to make the chili in two parts, which means it only takes slightly less time than the stove-top method.  But it's less labor-intensive, so it kind of breaks even.  For everything else, the small size is perfect and storage is so much easier than it would be with a 6 quart.  Just be aware before you buy, if haven't used a pressure-cooker previously, you CAN'T FILL IT TO THE TOP! You can only fill it 2/3 full if you're pressure cooking.  But it's a brilliant tool."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"My little instapot IS SO DANG CUTE!! And so much easier to manage vs the 8at I'd been using. I still have that one for my big batches, but this one for everyday dinners. It's just the right size for my 3 teens and me. Helps with portion control too!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"We have used the pot for pressure cooking racks of beef ribs for sinigang and chuck for pot roast. We already made our money back on what we would have spent on take out. I have read that the pots don't hold up though. So far we haven't had any issues after about 10 uses. I prefer this over the crock pot because we can sauté/boil and avoid additional cleaning. It cuts cooking time of tough meats to about an hour making dinner prep less of an ordeal. If the pot breaks with in the year as I have read from multiple reviews, I'll update my review.  I have not used it for rice because we have small rice cooker that produces enough rice for the family. Have not tried any of the included recipes yet either but plan to eventually, it was primarily for Beef Rib Sinigang and spending up pot roasts."

Do not buy ever !!!!!!I have contacted instant pot and filled out a ticket about this obvious warranty defect and am waiting for a response. I will update if a resolution is achieved."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love this Instant Pot 8qt PC. It does everything it claims to do. I've cooked ragu, corned beef, chocolate molten lava cake, creme brulee,  Chinese red bean dessert, pinto and red kidney beans and more. It has cut cooking time by more than half if done on the stove or oven but it does take around 20 minutes to come to pressure. To help cut the warm up time, I boil water before I put it into the PC. I also used the Cosori PC and it's night and day compared to the Instant Pot. The Cosori is so aggravating to use. It has problems cooking from the off setting. If you want to cook again after you just finished you have to jump though hoops.  You have to pull the plug and wait for the electronics to reset and hope it will work and even then it would not come to pressure or takes forever to come back to pressure.  With the Instant Pot, if the food is not cooked enough for you, all you need to do is just program it to cook again and it will without any problem.  Don't skimp. Pay the extra cost. The Instant Pot is 100 times better than other brands especially the Cosori. Believe me, I've used two Cosori and both worked the same. It was not defective. It's just does not work well. Theres a reason why the Instant Pot is rated the best because it is. Just buy it and you want regret it."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I hesitated to pull this out of the package after I got it because I was a little intimidated of using it. I'm so glad I finally did! This Instant Pot is amazing! It literally does it all...sautés, steams, cooks perfect rice, tender and flavorful meats, soups, stews, etc. and best of all...it's fast and easy to use. I haven't used my stove, microwave, or oven since I started using this instant Pot. With a quick review of the instruction manual and some recipies online I learned to use this quickly. As a busy working mom, this amazing appliance turned weeknight dinners around. Instead of spending tons of time in the kitchen after working a long day, I can have a delicious meal ready for my family in 30 minutes or less. Don't be intimidated by the Instant Pot...it makes delicious, flavorful meals and has made life so much easier!! I love this thing!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"It took me a long while to decide I probably ""needed"" one of these things. Honestly, I really don't ""need"" a thing, it's just that legions of people have been going on and on, gushing about the Instant Pot's fine qualities and multi-taking capabilities for a long time. After several years of almost nothing but rave reviews I decided it couldn't hurt to try one. Really, what are you if you don't even try?  So when a super great deal on a Mini Duo 3 QT Instant Pot came along, with great anticipation I purchased one. Mostly because we just bought our first Motorhome and I thought it may come in handy and it's smaller, just-for-two size appealed to me. I pictured myself making fabulous meal after more fabulous meal, parked along the ocean, a remote mountain stream, or some out in the middle of nowhere RV park. Getting heaps of compliments from my guy, as he takes seconds or thirds. And all the while him telling me I'm a certified genius in the kitchen. Me, beaming with pride. But that's just in my head, because I haven't even used it in the motorhome yet.  But I have made three ""just testing it out"" meals so far. I am impressed. It's got a great, quality feel to it. It works just like it says it will. To be truthful, and I'm not ashamed to admit this...I was rather intimidated by all the buttons, noises and functions, this is not your grandmother's pressure cooker;  so I went on YouTube and watched several ""how to use your Instant Pot"" videos. The first time I made the recommended ""hot water"" recipe, it came out perfect and I was so proud of myself. I can tell this little gadget is going to come in handy and I have zero regrets with my purchase. The only down side that I can see right now, and it's not really a downside, is that the meals coming from this little Mini Duo are so good, they don't last long enough for leftovers! There may be a new and larger Instant Pot in my future. I will say this, and it's not a negative, just an observation...after reading about other users saying that the smells of meals of long ago, cling to the rubber ring, I also found that to be true. So now I am researching how other Instant Pot users keep theirs  smelling fresh and pretty. Hello Vinegar! Oh, and I also think getting a glass lid may be a next logical step. And maybe and Instant Pot cookbook. Here I go! I'm a convert now!Overall? I'm really happy with my purchase. There is a learning curve, but if an aging baby-boomer can use this, anyone can! You won't be disappointed unless you don't have one. But what you don't know won't hurt you either :)"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is the most used appliance in my house now! I hesitated buying it for so long, and now wish I'd bought it a year ago. It saves me so much time in the kitchen. The 6 quart is a good size and not too big. It saves electricity from not using my oven as much to cook, and it keeps the nutrients in the food by not nuking it in the microwave! I love the speed of it. Dry beans cooked in an hour, start to finish! Boiled cabbage is 15 minutes, start to finish without stinking up the house. A fully cooked chicken now takes about an hour start to finish, and we have sandwiches all week! Boston butt roast for pulled pork also cooks in less than an hour. I love that it also cooks frozen meats quickly, in case you forget to set it out to thaw. Rice is perfect and fluffy, and no boil-overs. Perfect boiled eggs, meatloaf, and more. It's really been a miracle worker! I can't wait to get some additional accessories like a cheesecake pan and bundt pan for it to make banana bread,desserts, and lasagna. (Once you buy it, join the IP Community on Facebook to get great tips and recipes.)"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This might honestly be the best purchase I've made in a long time.Since buying this pressure cooker, (I think 1-2 weeks ago, tops), I have made everything from chicken wings, pulled pork sandwhiches, pot roast, beef short rib, 2 kinds of chicken drumsticks and chicken soup!That is a ton of food that I would normally not try because of low laborious the process is so laborious but this machine makes everything so easy. I'm cooking faster, more frequently and with way less clean-up.Couple of things to note:1. Sometimes it takes a bit of wiggling around to get the lid on. Which would be fine, except it makes an annoying chiming sound everytime.2. It takes about 10-15 minutes to come up to high pressure and about 20-25 minutes for Natural Release.3. From my expereince, the cook times are about 1 minute too high. I just adjust to achieve maximum tenderness.4. I wish that I had 2 of these bad boys for the side dishes but it's easy to cook the sides while the machine works on the main course.If you're new to pressure cooking, I'd recommend getting a cook book to go along with this. I purchased Bob Warden's Slow Food Fast - it's great but a bit simple. If you're looking for something slightly more intricate, I've heard good things about Miss Vickie's Big Book of Pressure Cooking (not sure if that's the exact title).Overall, I HIGHLY recommend."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I thought about purchasing one of these for a while, but was a little overwhelmed with the idea of trying to figure it all out and learn how to cook with it (not to mention making sure I didn't blow something up), but I'm really enjoying this thing! Forgot to defrost something for dinner? No problem - throw in a totally frozen corned beef and it's moist and tender in 1.5 hours. Pot roast and chicken in much less time than usual to bake and it's moist and not choke it down dry. I'm enjoying it so much, I've bought a couple cookbooks for more ideas. One tip - get the glass lid accessory - I use that a lot for sauteing and slow cooking soups do I can see in. Also, although this is a 6 quart cooker, it's max is really more like 4 quarts (good too know when making soups or stews), but has been very adequate for my family of 4 (or 8-10 when doing a big pot of soup or stew)."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"+ Gets slow cooking things like beans/etc done about twice as fast as normal, and not having to monitor, add water, burn and set off the smoke detectors and ruin pans!+ Excellent build quality.  The stainless insert is amazing, I have not seen as high a quality metal/finish before.- Slightly confusing function controls.  Not too bad, but prefer using manual mode most of the time.- Some cooking instructions/recipes included have incorrect times.  Chickpeas took 50min not 35min!  Pretty far off.  We simply do a test run with our first batch of whatever we're cooking and then adjust and write the new, correct, time in the book.- Doesn't work well for thick soups/etc, Lentil soup from recipe book burned a bit on the bottom.Overall, very satisfied, instructions and recipes aside, it's great!(Update 8/8/14)I bought another one of these because the first is working so well for my girlfriend!However, I received the new one and the stainless insert was pitted and had rust all over the bottom!  It definitely was not safe to eat from.  I almost looked as if the unit had been used before, the packing was sloppy too.  Luckily Amazon has an awesome return service!  I was very surprised by the poor quality of what came after having got the first one which was perfect.  I hope the replacement is better, otherwise I'm going elsewhere!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I’m finally excited about being in the kitchen again! I’ve been so scared of cooking for years that I’ve become too timid to approach any dish with more than a few steps, and even those I end up ruining. This lil robot helps me make delicious and healthy dinners daily with minimal effort and minimal risk of screwing it up!! So easy to use (and find recipes for), so approachable, so convenient, and everything seems to come out PERFECT. Can’t wait to see what else I can do with it! If you are worried about safety or are scared of pressure cooking like I was, just take the time to read the manual carefully, it’s very thorough."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love my instant pot. The cook time is not as quick as recipes indicate, because the pot takes 10-15 minutes to pressurize. BUT, once the ingredients are in it’s all down time. No babysitting the stove. I find myself cleaning the kitchen while dinner is cooking, which I never did before. Love it!"
1.0 out of 5 stars,I've used the pressure cooker a couple times and it worked fine. Maybe 3 times tops.  The most recent time it stopped sealing correctly and would never get up to a seal that would start the pressure cooker. All the valves are set correctly. I tried contacting support on their website and never heard back.  I have a one year warranty but apparently no one at this company responds to warranty messages. Just beware when purchasing.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I am having fun with this product. I admit, I was really frightened at first, and imagined blowing up food, but it has been easier every time I use it, and I have now used it to saute and to cook, and I've made a few different things in it. I think this is going to be a nice time saver and the flavors are really nice, somehow coming together in a surprising, but similar way to things cooked over time."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"If you enjoy hard cooked eggs that practically peel themselves, delicious freshly made yogurt, perfectly cooked al dente pasta, and cooking meatloaf and mashed potatoes at the same time, in 15 minutes, then the Instant Pot Duo,  is what you need.  Love. The. Instant. Pot.Just a few of the many things that I have made in the last two months.  Ramen noodles with beef Short Ribs and Egg, Korean Beef Short Ribs, Yogurt with Pears, Honey & Pistachios, Yogurt with Fresh Peach Preserves, Individual Breakfast Quiche, Lamb Tagine, Jambalaya, Seafood Pasta, Meatloaf and Mashed Potatoes......"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Completely replaces my crockpot and shortens cooking times for many dishes by hours.  Instead of starting a pot-roast at noon on the stove top, I start it at 3:00 to be completed by 5:00.  The sauté function sears the roast at high temperature and cooks in 90 minutes.  The roast is delicious and the gravy is the best I’ve ever tasted.Other items like a family size portion of potatoes or rice don’t cook faster than on the stovetop because it needs to heat up to pressurize.  However; it does free up stovetop space for large meals and the dishes are cooked to consistent perfection.A little difficult to clean pot as aromas seem to linger after cleaning.  Cleaning the lid and lid seal are difficult.  I have to leave the lid off and shake the water out of seal several times over 24 hours before putting the the lid on and storing the pot...but it’s absolutely worth it."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is a great pressure cooker and slow cooker.  We use it primarily for pressure cooking and it makes a world of difference in the food.  A great example was a recipe with black daal.  We tried it with a slow cooker for 24 hours and the beans were still tough.  With the Instant Pot they cooked perfectly in an hour.  We use it for most things we would typically slow cook and the results are great, ribs, pulled pork, dashi, you name it there is a recipe for it.  I was familiar with the old pressure cookers which could be challenging to use.  This one is great, push a button and let it go.  Have also used this to sauté vegetables and meats as recipes call for, again works really well and clean up of pan is easy.  There are other features haven’t used yet but will get to eventually.  Also the 6 qt version fits in our cabinets which is a real plus not having to give up counter space.  I wasn’t sure what all the hype was about with Instant Pot but now I understand.  One final note on pressure cooking ... while cook time may be 5-10 minutes the actually time can be closer to 30-45 minutes to account for getting to pressure and pressure release.  When on sale this a great deal!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Absolutely love my instant pot...both of them.  I bought the 8 quart pot first.  I loved it so much after using it once (on the Kahlua pork recipe in the included recipe book) that I bought the 6qt a week later so I can make a full meal  or a single pot meal with a dessert at one time quickly. Here are some pro's, cons, and tips I've discovered in the short, but fun time I've used my pots.  I'll start with the cons since there is only one.Cons:1.  The stainless steel inner pot has has a few small ""light spots"".  No effect on cooking though.Pros:1.  No spill-overs. The locking lid keeps juices and liquid inside the pot.2. Space saving.  Easily fits on my counter tops3. Time saving.  Meals cook in less than half the time than conventional methods.4. Safe Cooking.  The timer, included safety features (e.g. Auto shut off , lid lock etc.)5.  Lots of cooking options: steam, pressure cooking, sautée/brown, rice, etc.  All work as phenomenally.  (I've used manual mostly, but I've tested several of the automatic functions.6.  Included product manual and recipe book guide users through the steps of using the pot.7.  Included rack and measuring cup are a great addition.  The rack makes lifting items out of the inner pot a breeze.8.  Option of using either high or low pressure allows for cooking an even wider variety of foods (some delicate foods work better with low pressure)Tips:1.  Recommend purchasing glass lid, additional sealing rings (at least one for savory and one for sweet dishes), steamer trays and 6 or 7 inch aluminum, casserole, springform or other oven safe pans for cooking in dishes that can be store in the cooking container.  These are also great for making desserts. The extra rings com in handy for keeping sweet flavors sweet and savory flavors savory in the pot.  The rings take on the smell of the foods you cook.  Washing and air drying after each use helps with this.  The glass lid is great for sautéing and slow cooking because it allows you to visually monitor the sautées or slow cooking.2.  For Cleaning I recommend rubbing the stainless steel inner pot with a half of lemon (with rind) after washing it in warm soapy water (though it is dishwasher safe).  Like many stainless steel pots, sometimes food leaves stains or film on the surface (e.g. Pasta film) even after washing.  Rubbing with a lemon half, rinsing and re-washing helps tremendously.  Helps with stainless steel steamer trays too.3.  If using the 8 quart on standard countertops with cabinets overhead, I've found that draping a towel across the cabinet door helps absorb steam from quick release.  I use a towel when using my 6 quart as well.4.  I recommend purchasing an instant pot specific cookbook.  The included book is good, but, it has mostly single item dishes.  I've noted that some books focus on ""one-pot"" meals which is a custom fit for the instant pot.I definitely recommend the instant pot.  In fact I'm thinking of gifting a couple to friends."
5.0 out of 5 stars,This size is perfect for a single person or a couple.Takes up small real estate on countertop where I don’t mind leaving it permanently in it’s dedicated spot and ready to use almost daily!  Boiled eggs are awesome to peel... to frozen chicken ready in 15 mins!  I’ve made delicious homemade yoghurt and many soups/chili and Quinoa.  Steamed baked potatoes are cooked perfect thru.  It’s great to just reheat leftovers and not worry about drying out.Did I mention it can replace your oven for baking cakes?
5.0 out of 5 stars,"It is great to be able to cook frozen meat (that I forgot to take out of the freezer earlier in the day) in a matter of minutes.  I don't know how I did without a pressure cooker for this long.  There is a learning curve on the dos-and-don'ts with pressure cooking  This particular brand has lots of videos online to help get you involved with pressure cooking techniques if you are new to it like I was.  There are also tons of recipes books to help you out with different technique of cooking. I have had my InstaPot for a few months now and am starting to experiment with it. I highly recommend this particular brand because of the quality, design, options and the price is right."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've been wondering if I should get one of these and when it was on sale, I swooped it up. Holy crap am I glad I did!Beans are easier than ever. Ribs fall off the bone - easier. Stews MUCH tastier. Creme Brulee is amazing. Yogurt makes the wife so happy to have 1/2 gallon of it in the fridge all the time.I should have gotten this thing a long azz time ago. Corn beef brisket in 90 minutes."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Invented by single fathers, including a Chinese–Canadian GENIUS.The Instant Pot is ESSENTIAL for morons like me.Just set it and walk away, no worries, no burning;no pressure-cooker over-spill; no loud noises.Plugs in anywhere, not just the kitchen.Nothing cooks white beans better/faster;best split pea-'n'-hambone soup.Pressure Cook 12 hard-boiled jumbo eggs:  Put a little water below the steamer tray;  set it to 8 minutes... then forget about it, walk away.  Once cooled enough to open, put the eggs in the fridge,  so the shells come off easier."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my RV instant pot, I have a 6qt at home...I love these things. I was so surprised by how much food actually fits in this 3 qt pot. I made Mac and cheese for 10 people, granted there were no leftovers. The only think to keep in mind is most recipes you find will be for the 6qt so you have to add a little time since this pot is not as powerful. Not a dealbreaker for me, there’s only two of us and it saves space."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"What is there not to love about the instant pot? I have made tapioca dessert, broth, and bo kho, and they were delicious! It does cut down the cooking time for some foods (tapioca and broth), but not for others (bo kho). It does not radiate an insane amount of heat or have the aroma permeate the entire house (which might be a minus). We also made the best tasting Mac and cheese ever!!! Usually you would have to nurse and watch the water, like the water for the tapioca too. However, with the instant pot, you set the timer and come back when it goes off. The babysitting time is almost non-existent with the instant pot! :)"
1.0 out of 5 stars,"No true problems with it, just make sure that you clean everything properly. As an aside, and not really worth mention, it does run a little cold on the yogurt settings.Edit: my second instant pot refuses to pressurize, and I have to almost double the liquid I use to even get the float valve to close. From experience with my first pot and my friends- my newest one is the only one that appears to leak a ton of steam around the lid. Their Q/A must not be the best."
1.0 out of 5 stars,I tried to make rice and also tried to cook potatoes in this. It never worked for me. I thought it was me that couldn't figure this out. So I never asked to replace it. It has sadly sat in my pantry room unused. I have talked to a few people and found out that theirs also did not work when they got theirs but they found out that there was a part they needed replaced and the company sent it to them and it worked after that. I wish I had thought of that too back when I bought this. Sad. I really wanted to cook with mine. I have seen a lot of YouTube videos of recipes and it looks fantastic.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"First let me say that I grew up in a home where Mom did not use a pressure cooker. The only experience I had with pressure cookers was my grandmother who made wonderful mysterious recipes with her old fashioned pressure cooker. But also, more once, my grandfather had to repair the ceiling over the stove due to the her pressure cooker ""blowing"" its top.So I grew up afraid of the mysterious explosive device. My husband implored me to take lessons from his mother and make him things like beans, etc. I flatly refused. He bought me one anyway. I used it twice. It whistled and jiggled and I was scared to death it was going to explode in my kitchen. My husband told me to run water over it to cool it down. I looked at him like he was crazy! Pick up that hot pressurized pot and carry it over to the sink and deliberatly run cold water over it? Did he think I was insane?So, now you know how I feel about the old fashioned pressure cookers. I ran across this one during Amazon's Lightning Deals. I read some of the reviews. People talked about making homemade chicken stock. I love homemade chicken stock. I hate how long it takes on the stove. I read how you could do it in just a few minutes in the pressure cooker. No skimming, no stiring, not all day process. I pondered and contimplated and thought about it. I clicked it into the cart and removed it, then added it back. Finally, I just hit the buy button. I AM SO GLAD I DID.I got it home, unpacked it and read the booklet. I was still concerned. I read every recipe I could find on the internet. I finally settled down and decided to give it a try. Threw in some chicken bones and some celery, onion and carrots. Topped it off with water, thyme, salt and pepper, locked the lid and pushed the buttons. I sat in the kitchen (the far side of the kitchen). Steam began to escape and it made little puffs of noise. (Not very loud,  mind you, but if you listened closely, you could hear it and I was listening closely). Suddenly, the little button on the top popped up and all noise and all steam stopped. The count down started and it was completely silent. I was wondering if there was something wrong. The timer counted down and the keep warm button came on. I turned off the unit as I was instructed and let it cool down naturally (again, as recommended). I could have done the fast cook down which involves flipping a lever so the steam and pressure escapes, but this recipe called for letting the pressure come down naturally. Finally the button dropped and was able to open the lid.The fragence of the stock immediatly made my mouth water. I strained the liquid and let it set in my fridge overnight. What I had the next day was a slight coating of chicken fat and under that was the most wonderful gelatinous stock I'd ever seen. I packaged it in 2 cups quart zippies and stuck them in my freezer. I used some to make some creamy chicken and wild rice soup (again in the pressure cooker). (You don't add the cream till the end). OMG!!!! It was ambrosia.Since then I have made a roast, pork stock, more chicken stock, turkey stock, and ""casseroles"" with pasta. (Yes, you can cook a one pot meal of pasta, veggies, and meat and it can be done in under 30 minutes!!!). Oh, and I made beans; black eyed peas to be exact. No overnight soaking and done in just minutes. I used some of the home smoked pork I had. I have never cooked beans from scratch before; What a difference! I was always envious of my church lady friends who would bring in ""from scratch"" bean dishes for Sunday pot lucks. They were soooo good. All I ever made was canned. Yuck. I also made ribs. Imagine home cooked ribs in under 30 minutes (I did char them in the broiler for a few minutes to give them that ""grilled"" finish), but a little liquid smoke and we had perfectly tender pork ribs that were juicy and flavorful in so little time.I am IN LOVE. I haven't even used the yogurt or rice steamer or other features.And clean up... drop the pot in the dishwasher, take the rubber seal out of the top, give the lid and rubber seal a sink wash and you are done.Simple, fast, quiet, versatile and delicious. I can't imagine anyone wanting to go back to the old fashioned kind after using one of these. I don't know how this rates against other electric pressure cookers. I can't imagine that any could top this one and have no desire to even check."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love my 6 qt! I live alone but work 12h night shifts so I like to cook ahead for the entire week since I don't want to lift a finger at home on the nights I work. I find that most recipes online can be cooked as-is for 4 portions, but since this IP is big enough some can be doubled! I'll be honest here - I'm a very anxious person and was worried about blowing myself up with this. But I've found the safety features satisfactory in the 2 months I've owned this. I can't speak to longevity, but I got it for only $49 for a Black Friday/Cyber Monday sale and I've already used it to make ~48 portions of work lunches and lazy dinners!"

5.0 out of 5 stars,"So even with the directions it's a bit hard to understand how to work it, but the BEAUTIFUL sheet of times for how long you need to cook everything is perfect! It takes a bit of trying to actually understand the meaning of all the symbols/words that pop up on the screen but most of the time I've just googled what it means. It's very easy to clean, but no so easy to get smells out of (could also be on me since I cooked shrimp in it very first thing). Overall good product but is definitely not an air fryer so if that's what your looking for, not the same thing!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"We love the instant pot! I am not a brave home chef, but this was so easy and not at all scary! It cooks juicy flavorful chicken in 6 minutes. I will never cook chicken another way ever again. The 8 qt fit enough chicken to feed a party of 32 people pulled chicken sliders with enough leftovers to feed our small family for 2 weeks. I cooked boneless chicken breasts & thighs then used a handheld mixer to shred it. Added BBQ sauce and it was fantastic! Even small children that are picky eaters loved it.  They asked me to share the recipe at the dinner table. We usually like to add veggies to the ip while the chicken cooks so everything is ready at the same time. It is very easy to clean with dish soap and bartenders best friend powder cleaner for tough jobs. I usually put it in the dishwasher on the bottom rack and that is working great. I have converted 2 family members to join the ip life. My parents live close so I just cook theirs in my ip. We are so glad they invented this!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,A little complicated to use but worth the effort to learn.  Quick cooking times make traditional crock pot recipes possible with minimal planning ahead.  Results are delicious.  Must have for busy families that want healthy meals!
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Being single, it was hard to find things to cook for just me.  This makes it easy to cook single portions or larger portions to store for later in the week.  Recipes are all over the internet.  I get home, put the ingredients in and come back to a completely done meal.  Love how moist chicken is, and I love to saute hamburger, put in the dry pasta and sauce and come back a few minutes later to a completely done meal all in one pot!  Super easy to cook, clean and put right back on the shelf.  No left over dishes."
2.0 out of 5 stars,"I just got a instant pot. So far, ive only made one thing in the instant pot. I made chicken. It took 30 minutes to cook. The chicken was defrosted. It only take 10 to 12 minutes to make in my pressure cooker. So, im not going to make meat in it anymore. I will update my review after i make something else in the instant pot. So far, im not impressed with the instant pot."
2.0 out of 5 stars,"Purchased this because I wanted to save space in a small home. Sadly, the performance of this is nowhere near another stand-alone air fryer I use, and it really doesn’t save any space. The lid is bulky and storage is odd. Worse — it takes much longer for food to cook than my Cosori 5.8 qt which also holds more food. Overall, great concept, but dissapointed in the execution."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I must say I read with some skepticism all the breathless reviews on this thing. It may be relevant also to mention that I stumbled across this unit as I was searching for something simpler: a plain old crock pot. I'd never had one of those before but as a recent re-entrant into the ranks of bachelorhood I really needed a way to be able to cook long cook-time things (mainly stews, soups) without it taking my attention the entire time. I opted for this unit thinking that even if I only use it as a crock pot, the programming capabilities are quite bit more sophisticated than what any of the crock pots I found were offering. But in the shot time I've had it I've used it in a number of different ways besides just the crock pot feature. This unit is quite versatile. I've only used the pressure cooking feature a few times but I can say that parts works very nicely. As other reviewers have pointed out, the marketing team may have been heavily involved in crafting the claimed 70% time savings. It's a perfect marketing thing.. just enough truth to it to be confusing to the unsuspecting. Yes you probably save 70% of the actual cooking time this way, but by the time you add back in the time it takes to ramp up to pressure and the time it takes to ramp back down to ambient (less so when you do quick-release which is safe and simple) it's not quite in that range any more.In the short time I've had this unit I have made more soups and better soups than ever before. All with very little effort. Beef stew is fantastic (I do think it's worth it to take the extra 10-15 minutes on the front end to saute the meat). The day I got it was a workday. I cam home from work and found it on the porch, and put it to use right away. After a long day at work I set the thing up to make a beef stew while I slept (in slow cooker mode). Woke up to a lovely stew the next morning, put some in the fridge for later and took some for lunch that day. Very good stew. Looking forward to experimenting with different seasonings for different versions of the stew, and to giving pot roast a try.I do heartily recommend this unit. The only thing I could think of that I might ask for is to persuade the manufacturer to offer an earthenware version of the insert that the food cooks in. It comes with stainless, which seems to be of good quality and definitely does the job. Maybe the earthenware version wouldn't be up to the task of saute I don't know."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Frozen meats cooked perfectly through and through in a matter of minutes.  Frozen vegetables cooked perfectly in about 8 minutes.  Chocolate lava cake. Oatmeal was the best I've ever had with no splattering. Cheese Cakes.  Perfect Sticky rice with no soaking in about half the cook time.  Venison roasts that don't taste ""gamey"".  Be aware that there is a 10 minute warm up and pressure build before cooking time starts.  Easy to clean.  Our only problem we had at the start of the Instant Pot learning curve was the ""Burn"" warning we got when trying to melt a pound of velveta.  The pot is smart enough to realize when creamy dishes begin to burn and stick to the bottom of the pan and it shuts itself off.  If you have heard of these things exploding due to pressure, that's not a problem either due to safeguards built into the pot.  Tons of great recipes on line."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Some friends of ours kept raving about the awesomeness of Instant Pot. How it would cook up anything in a hurry like tasty soups, veggies, whole sides of beef or whatever.Our Instant Pot arrived about six weeks ago. My wife was immediately suspicious, eyeing the Instant Pot as if were a danger to our home and health (""PRESSURE COOKER?!?!. Don't those things blow up and k*ll people?!?!"")I told her I loved her, respected her point of view and promised to follow all safety instructions. Then she left the premises while I got the Pot set up and cooked up a tasty Butternut Squash soup. One of her faves, no less.Since then:1. My lovely wife has fallen in love with Instant Pot;2. We've adopted favorite recipes and are trying new ones;3. We're eating healthier food;5. Eating more meals at home is making our bank account grow.YES - It's easy to useYES - You can cook all kinds of stuff in itYES - There are THOUSANDS of recipes on YouTube videos and in FB GroupsYES - It's easy to cleanYES - Lazy people will love this thingStop reading reviews, order your Instant Pot and promise you'll cook three recipes in it. Trust me, you WILL be hooked."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I was looking for something to replace my crock pot and stumbled across Instant Pot. After reading some reviews and doing alittle research I decided to give it a whirl. I was not disappointed! I highly recommend following some facebook groups or even looking on Pinterest for insight and recipes. I love how it works, As a mom to two under two, spending hours on dinner is not something I can do. This has made it possible for me to make delicious, full meals that taste amazing and only spend a short amount of prep time on. The meat turns out so amazing and falls apart! I have also used it to make baked potatoes and sweet potatoes. Seriously makes them so quick and soft all the way through. I have also been able to save space because I have packed up my crock pot, rice cooker and egg steamer. This machine does it all!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"If you've ever been afraid to use a pressure cooker fear no more! I cooked delicious chicken drumsticks today for the first use of mine and they turned out wonderful in only 11 minutes. The pressure feature really forces your seasonings and flavor into the chicken. i used a can of chicken broth with a little extra water for the required 18 ounces of liquid needed for pressure cooking. Just be cautious when you turn the pressure relief valve--wear a oven mitt for protection, keep your face back from it, and push it with a handled utensil to let the steam escape."
5.0 out of 5 stars,We bought this for my wife’s mom after we purchased one and my wife fell in love with it. She makes most every large meal in it now and they turn out perfect each time. It is a fire and forget culinary weapon that can turn anyone into a chef at home. A bit of a learning curve but plenty of instruction out there on YouTube and the manufacturer’s website. Recommend getting the model with a stainless steel pot.
3.0 out of 5 stars,"Disappointed in Instant Pot’s decision to change their cord design from strong and detachable to flimsy and permanent. That is until it gets hit just right.If the new cord breaks you will have to get a new pot.Feels cheaper and disposable.Had I been aware of this change, I’d have kept my old pot instead of selling. Or purchased the extended warranty of 4 years.Product came defective at a bad time. I didn’t have time to return product as I was unable to use my stove. Sold my previous unit to upgrade to the 8 quart, and had holiday cooking to do.Unit arrived defective. Inner pot was scratched and top had permanent black around the rim. The enamel on the unit was chipped and rusted beneath!I have since received a replacement unit. I haven’t had a chance to open the new unit for inspection as I work so much.Unit seemed refurbished.Disgusted in the new quality of Instant Pot compared to my old unit."
3.0 out of 5 stars,"The pot worked perfectly for a couple of months. I really loved it. I live by myself and don't cook much. This pot is particularly handy for one person meals--soup, stew, and of course, rice. Every time I cooked, it could serve several meals. However, a few months ago, after I used it for 8-9 months, it started to take longer than normal to cook brown rice. At the beginning, it would take about 45 minutes to an hour for brown rice. But later, it could take up to 1.5 hours. It just kept getting worse. Last month, after using it for almost a year, I had to use ""Multigrain"" mode to cook white rice. Now, even if I use ""Multigrain"" mode to cook white rice, some rice would be only half cooked (soft outside but hard and crispy in the heart). I contacted customer support on the company's website. I will see what response I get."
5.0 out of 5 stars,Not bad - nice appliance to have in the kitchen. I haven't got through all the modes but I've cooked a couple meals in it. Food turned out pretty good. Chicken didn't have any color but was tasty. I guess it's an appliance you'll (I) would have to get use to and actually remember to use it hahaha. I'm so use to the stove I forget I have a pressure cooker that will cut cook time down in half.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"What can I say??  Hands down the greatest small appliance anyone can ever have in their kitchen. Also one of the healthest. This replaces my Insta Pot 6 quart I have had for several, several years and still works after using at least once everyday and even after dropping on the floor and cracked the lid. I am keeping it for back up and if the time comes when I might need two at once. I have been wanting the 8 quart since they came out with it and thought it was time for my 6 quart to go in semi retirement after all  the use and abuse. Plus if my 6 quart did decide to throw in the towel I would not be happy going a day without  another one. I would not even think about buying another brand after my experience with my old Insta Pot. And I love the stainless steel inter pot. Thank you for making a quality product, no matter where it was made. Quality is getting harder and harder to find these days."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I wasn't sure I was going to like this pot. At first I thought I had made a mistake, since I've used a pressure cooker most of my adult life and I'm sixty. I thought this was just a gimmick. However, I have been proven wrong. The timer function means I can set it, walk away, and not have to worry about hanging around the stove to make sure the cooking time is correct on my food ... and no more of the infernal racket from the jiggler on the lid! My favorite part? If I forget to soak my beans overnight, there is a way to do that in the pot. Just pressure cook them for four minutes, slow depressurize for ten minutes, and let the pressure off. Your beans will act as though they have been soaked overnight and you can go ahead and cook with them. They are not cracked and the skins are not coming off. I love it."

5.0 out of 5 stars,"Only two problems with my 6 quart Duo Plus.One: Many of the recipes I have tried needed more time than the recipes stated -- BUT, that may just be the recipe that I got from the internet.  A rocket scientist could figure it out, tho', so I may have a chance, yet.Two: Though there are only two of us, I may have to get an 8 quart, also.  I want to cook for our family when they come for a visit.  The 8 quart would have been much better for that.Fall-off-the-Bone Baby Back Ribs were awesome.  Never had any so tender or tasty.  Two racks. One standing, curled around the inside of the wall of the inner pot, and the other rack cut into three pieces flat in the center.Chicken and vegetables was an awesome meal!  Breast was the tenderest I've had.The shells almost just fall off boiled eggs, and I've got the time adjusted where they are absolutely perfect for making the greatest egg-salad sandwiches ever.Best and quickest Cheesy Cauliflower Soup I ever tasted in my life!  Huh! As a matter of fact, I think it's the only Cheesy Cauliflower soup I ever tasted.  But Holy Mackerel! It was good!  Made enough for three meals for the two of us.  Put the extra meals up in the freezer in pint jars.Would I recommend it? Surely!  But you'd probably just as well get an 8 quart.  Cause you can cook little meals in the 8 quart, but you can't cook large meals in the 6 quart.  And that ain't rocket science.  :)"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I clean it, but I would not say it is easy to clean.  Lot's of nooks and crannies to get into.  The small metal cage inside the lid that the steam comes out of is difficult to remove for cleaning, but you just have to get it off and clean it.  The seal always smells like what ever you cooked, I don't care how much you clean it.  It's a great product though.  I've given it as a gift because I enjoy cooking with it so much."
3.0 out of 5 stars,"I recently started using my instant pot last month, I was very happy with it up until today when I am having power issues with my instant pot, it is not powering on. I only washed the lid and the steel container? And advise?I don’t see any water anywhere, on the same outlet I plugged another appliance and it powers up fine, so it is not the outlet, it is the instant pot. I tried to plug it to another outlet and it didn’t work on that outlet either?That’s why 3 stars.Can you help?"
1.0 out of 5 stars,"In six mouths I used this product maybe 8 times, then when I plug-in the display panel did not come on check the cord and outlet no display.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"The good news:Up until today, I’ve only made two meals in this product (chili and a roast), but I can already tell that it’s versatility is as advertised. With so many settings, it can do just about anything. One amazing feature is the “burn warning.” How many times have you scorched a pot or pan cooking chili or a stew? This product gives you a warning that your meal is either just starting to, or about to burn. This is extremely nice even if it’s just starting to burn, because it gives you an opportunity to scrape off the beginnings of the glazing, giving your dish a little extra flavor depth. In fact, many recipes you’ll find actually recommend starting off in “Sauté” mode to create this early glazing, just so you can scrape it off and cook into the meal.What they don’t tell you:Many of the dishes you’ll find still take considerable prep time. The “time to cook” can be misleading. Something with a “30 minute time to cook” may actually require you to allow 1hr or more. For example 20 minutes to prepare the ingredients or perform some of the pre-cooking steps, plus the time it takes the cooker to warm up and build pressure, generally 10-15 minutes, on top of your 30 minute cook time. Some more elaborate dishes may even take more time to prepare than to cook. It’s a great product, but it’s not magic and it’s not a time machine, you still have to put in some work."

5.0 out of 5 stars,"I wasn't sure if I'd like this Instant Pot IP-DUO60 7-in-1 or not. But, it is easy to use and I liked all the safety features and the larger size will make it more versatile than the smaller size. I grew up with my mother using a pressure cooker but I never really adopted using it as an adult but lately have decided to change that. The unit arrived quickly and was in good condition. It arrived in a cardboard box within the product box. The Instant Pot IP-DUO60 7-in-1 unit has a lot of nice features including ability for making yogurt and rice. After doing the initial test run I decided to try cooking whole grain rice. The included recipe booklet has both English and Chinese language broken up into 2 different sections. Interestingly, the pictures in the Chinese section was much bigger than in the English section. Anyways, I followed the whole grain rice English recipe which uses the manual mode and not the rice mode. I couldn't believe it - in about 30 minutes the whole grain rice came out perfect-the best I've ever had! I noticed that the unit came up to pressure very fast - faster than I can do on the stove with my traditional pressure cooker. It also didn't produce any steam or overflow liquid (like I've seen happen in my Cuisinart rice cooker which produced a horrible mess). It's handy that it has a little overflow container should any liquid come out. I also made vegetable soup which came out great. I do pay attention to the maximum fill line. It's so nice that once it's set you can leave it to it and don't have to watch over it. Nice feeling of freedom."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I got bit by the bug. I had to see what all the fuss was about. I waited too long till it wasn't on sale, regretted it for weeks, then not only purchased it, but upgraded to the 8qt. It's quite large, but not overwhelming. I won't go into detail about why it's amazing - there are plenty of other reviews that will do that for you. Join the Facebook group. It's an incredible community with invaluable information. Check out HipPressureCooking.com if that doesn't convince you. Seriously though - a whole frozen $3 chicken to fall-off-the-bone deliciousness in under an hour? Juicy, tender BBQ ribs in 20 minutes? Kiss your crockpot goodbye, maybe your stove, and possibly even your oven. I can't even, y'all."
2.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought this pot last year, but after countless tries, I have never been able to get the lid to seal properly. I put in plenty of liquid required for each recipe, but the food inside ALWAYS ends up dry or scorched. I can't even cook beans or rice. A friend of mine who uses her Instant Pot daily came over to see if my pot was working and she confirmed that I had a faulty lid that wouldn't seal. I tried to return it, but by the time I did so, the window to return it to this seller was expired. So I tried to return it to Instant Pot. I made 3 videos showing the problem, but the manufacturer denied my request for a replacement part. They were terrible to work with. I spent hours trying to process this issue, and the best they would do was to offer me a discount on a new lid. So frustrating. I am left with an appliance that has NEVER worked properly. I dumped $150 into something that now sits on a shelf in my garage."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I downsized from a 6qt to a 3qt instant pot and I absolutely adore the smaller size!  It is perfect for making meals for 1 (even for 2 people it would be sufficient) and the pot fits much easier into a standard dishwasher. For a few weeks after I moved to a new city it was the only means I had of cooking - I did hard boiled eggs, rice, stews, soups and everything came out great."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I can't say enough fabulous things about the Instant Pot. It's a HUGE time saver which is extremely important with 3 kids in multiple sports. I love that I can put my chicken in frozen and it still comes out juicy and delicious. In the winter, I love to make a huge pot of Broccoli Cheddar soup, which only takes 30 minutes instead of all day in my Crock-pot. All of the settings make it easy to make pretty much anything you can think of. The stainless steel pot & lid are easy to clean since they are dishwasher safe. It is very easy to learn how to use and figure out the timing. For anyone wanting to save time when cooking, this is a must have appliance."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Bought from amazon, It was bundled, shipped for free and arrived early. Also being double boxed and incased with foam there was no damage.As for the product itself, It is very easy to understand how to use this item. There is an, AS SEEN ON TV brand that I have read negative reviews on. I have never tried it but the online reviews of this one (Instant Pot IP-DUO60) along with youtube videos of actual cooking made me choose this one over it. I opened it, cleaned it with a drop of soap on a wet paper towel and went right on to cooking a 13 bean chili. Right away I was stumped. Eager to use my new shiny appliance, I had not pre-soaked the beans over night. No worries said the cooking guide. Altho infomercial skip over the warm up time of the unit which in some cases could be up to 10 minutes, the overall cooking is fast. So I stuck the beans (4 cups of water to 1 cup beans and 1 TBS salt and let it pressure cook for 4 minutes and then stay warming for 10 more minutes. simple enough. That gave me time to thaw & brown the meat, chop the onions and open the 16 ounces of tomato paste/sauce. when done I was in a hurry so I used the pressure release switch. OK.. here is where safety is very important. Nothing locks on this item until pressure is formed and by all means that is great because you never need to worry if something is stuck where it's pressure or a malfunction elsewhere. Be careful, obviously the steam will be hot but also, it will rise to the ceiling if you do it real fast and my concern for people who have lower ceiling than mine would be that you could damage the ceiling with moisture even if not the first time but over a period of time. so using a dish rag for safety being my first time, I let the pressure/steam out slowly and removed the lid. Strained the beans, added meat, sauce, seasoning, onions and then set the inner pot back in and let it pressure cook for 30 minutes. Then I turned it off and 20 minutes cooling down it was minutes from fully releasing pressure but there again, I was getting hungry so I released the last tiny bit of pressure and then.. A very large, very tasty meal was ready and I had used my very first electric pressure cooker. I even put some it containers and took some family members some to try and not only did they like it, their kids did as well.Clean up!Cleaning was easy and I am careful not to make a mess and get it inside the inner pot that is not removable and is where the heating element is. The only thing I had any issue with was the main pot. There were some spots left on it and I just haven't went back to read the book and see if there is a special way to clean it. All I used was a dish ran and dawn soap. I'm not used to cooking/cleaning in aluminum.Hopefully this helps."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Still learning how to use, but so far so good. Most recipes seem to be for the 6qt version. The mini is big enough for the two of us for most things. Would buy the 6qt if I had it to do over again, for the extra room. Might still buy the 6 or 8qt which I believe would be better size for cooking a roast, for example. I actually enjoy using an Instant Pot, now that I have one."
5.0 out of 5 stars,can not put it away.Using almost every day for every thing I can!
4.0 out of 5 stars,"I’ve waited to rate this until I’ve used it for lots of different dishes. I have to be honest, I had some hesitation in using this so it sat in the box for a couple weeks before I got enough gumption to open it and do the water test. Now I use it at least once a week and I find myself building my menu around IP recipes or looking for directions to alter my traditional recipes to make in the IP. The only feature that just doesn’t work great is the slow cooker feature, thus 4 stars instead of five. I’m thinking about getting the 3 qt mini lux for smaller dishes so I’m not using the stovetop and 6 qt pot. Definitely hooked!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I previously purchased the 5 quart Duo Instant Pot, and was so impressed with how it cooked food that I wanted a larger size. I got the 8-quart Duo Instant Pot on Black Friday, so that I could make larger pots of beans, soups and stews, and  I could have leftovers and freeze some for other days. The larger size is also better when you have a large family group and need to feed them! This stainless steel pot cleans so easily. I love good quality stainless steel. I use this Instant Pot not only many times per week but sometimes several times a day. So far today I have hard cooked a dozen eggs, I will be reheating some frozen soup later, and will probably make a pasta dish for when my son gets home from work tonight. The eggs peel so easily in the instant pot, that I will never hard boil eggs on the stove top again. Yesterday, I made some yogurt, which is delicious, and I know exactly what is in it. Since I use starter from the previous batch, the only cost for a gallon of yogurt is the cost of the gallon of milk needed. Studies have shown that yogurt is good for your heart long-term."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love my instant pot. I have yet to use all of the features but what I have made has turned out delicious. I was a little nervous to use it at first. I  consider myself fairly adept in the kitchen and I am not afraid to try out new cooking styles and techniques. I would say I have an 80% success rate on my meals. I was super excited to try this gadget. I have a slow cooker but it is just that...slow. I wanted something that I could come home from work at 4:00 pm and put some food in there and be ready to eat in an hour. This does just that. You have to research how long to make certain foods (ie. chicken, beef, pork chops, eggs, etc,) but there are so many recipes out there that much of the guess work is already done. I love this thing and would recommend it to any one willing to try it. The more you use it the more comfortable you will become. I was a little freaked out the first time I  let it vent out and the steam shot out. However, now I don't even flinch when I turn that knob. Make sure to practice safety when using it around little children. I have a 3 year out who loves to run around the kitchen but when the instant pot is going I make sure that there are no shenanigans happening. It was a great buy and I would purchase it again (also there were some great deals around Black Friday so if you want to try it but at a cheaper price I would hold out until November)."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I held off on getting an instant pot for quite a while and now I’m kicking myself for not getting one earlier. This thing is truly magical and in my opinion a kitchen savior (especially for us because our apartment kitchen is a joke). Now that I’m older, kitchen gadgets are my favorite things to purchase and this is the best overall so far. I am in absolute awe of how versatile this thing is. I’m pretty boring when it comes to cooking but the instant pot has pushed to me to branch out and attempt to cook things I normally wouldn’t even consider. And bonus, my impatient self doesn’t have to wait hours for a pot roast anymore! If you’re on the fence, just go for it, you will not regret it."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I am using this new fangled gadget like crazy to learn the various functions.  I love how whole grains turn out.  The saute function works fab.  Pressure cook allows for more regular hearty breakfasts vs a fried egg and toast.I need more time to learn it completely, but so far it stays on the counter because i am using it several times a week.  It is worth the cost to me.SIDEBAR:  I have the 6 qt pot and needed oven safe bowls to use in it.  I bought 7-cup pyrex bowls.  The price was better in a 4 pack.  I am glad i bought multiples, but two might be sufficient for making more than one dish for a single meal, or to have an extra if the other is storing a leftover dish."

I need it now to steam quickly to make baby food in a jiffy but I guess will stick to using stove top! I would like the seller to contact me for any resolution options!"
1.0 out of 5 stars,Completely stopped working after 3 months.  Horrible customer service at Instant Pot.  Amazon was totally customer-centric and quickly refunded me the amount I paid for it new.  I had a Wolfgang Puck pressure cooker for 12 years and it worked every time.

Then rubbed them with some Byron's Butt Rub and put them in the oven at 400 degrees for five minutes each side.  Fantastic, fall off the bone ribs in less than an hour.  Incredible. Next time, I am gonna finish them on the grill instead of the oven to get that smoky taste and crust."

There are so many online excellent Instant Pot recipes, (with Photos) to use with the Instant Pot.  Clean up is easier too with the 3 quart size.  The only problem I experience is remembering to make sure I turn the valve so it will come to pressure when cooking.  I also have the 6 quart Instant Pot Ultra for larger meals.  When I purchased the 6 quart, another customer told me I will love the Instant Pot.  She was right.  I ended up, (six months later) buying another one on Amazon, This Instant pot DUO Plus 3 quart size.  Both are great!"
4.0 out of 5 stars,"It's been a boon. Cut down cooking time significantly. Very sturdy and really safe. Love the design. Steel insert is non coated so does not pose any health hazards like non stick coatings. Because of this my diet has become healthier. Youtube is great with recipes.Loving it.Only issue is cleaning the lid and the ring inside. Wish they can make us hold for the plastic ring robust so that plastic ring can last long. Though i have not replaced it, i have feeling it will be needed.Saute temp is not high enough to temper some of the seasoning seeds such as  mustard. The selenium inside to be useful the seeds have to pop open. Otherwise they will just pass through the system."
2.0 out of 5 stars,"The pot was great at first using the pressure setting.  The slow cooker setting not so much.  I found that on the low setting, which some instant pot recipes called for, the food wasn't cooked after the specified cooking time (8 hours) Well only the food on the bottom was cooked.  The heat is not distributed evenly like a standard slow cooker, just from the bottom.  Also after a few uses, it stopped pressurizing.  Totally bummed!!!! I am processing the return with amazon, but now Im left without a cooker and am concerned with purchasing another one of these.  Im not sure if I should go wth another brand or what.  I cant deal with all of the returns lately."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I was very hesitant to buy this because I didn't want another item cluttering my kitchen countertop. However, this is a life changer. My husband and  I follow the Renaissance Periodization diet templates so I am ALWAYS cooking chicken, meat, sweet potatoes, rice, etc. This cuts down on my food prep time so much, and I have bought several inserts and lids (I actually purchased the lids directly from instant pot) and I'm able to cook and then pop everything in the fridge. It's easy to figure out, and although seems intimidating at first it is well-made and will let you know if the top isn't on correctly or if there's some other issue with the pressure. Since it has a sautee and slow cook mode, it provides other options for cooking rather than just pressure cooking. I was happy this is a 2-1 in machine so I'm able to get rid of my slow cooker. Another feature that I really like is that once it shuts off, it will keep food warm for 10 hours so you can have food waiting on you when you wake up or get home from work if you set it beforehand. Really happy with this purchase and highly recommend it."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"There are no words for how much I ADORE THIS POT. I'm an official Instant Pot-Head. Ever since our normal pressure cooker exploded and bathed the entire kitchen and much of the family room with corned beef, I've been frightened to use a pressure cooker. But I'm not scared anymore. The Instant Pot has changed all that with safety features that tell you if you've got the lid on properly, or if you're burning something.I've made bone broth of all kinds in it just in the first week. I had been using my slow cooker for as much as 24 hours to get the same amount of collagen output I get with this digital pressure cooker in just a couple of hours. It pressure cooked six raw boneless skinless thighs and two still frozen chicken breasts in under 12 minutes (I made pulled BBQ chicken sandwiches out of those). I made split pea soup in an hour that was perfectly smooth and required no blending at all. I made chicken and dumplings (from frozen chicken) in about an hour as well. Also made pot roast (from 3 lb. frozen roast) with mushroom gravy in one hour. Made the best Mexican beef for tacos and burritos I've ever eaten. The meats are always soft and tender -- and OMG, so fast. A great way to make more affordable cuts of meat unforgettable.Oh, and puhleaze...I can't forget to tell you about the big acorn squash that cooked from start to finish in 8 minutes! (It's usually an hour or more in the oven without the results being as creamy and delish.)You don't have to brown your meats and veggies in a seperate pot on the stove -- the sauté function works so well on this, I just brown things, and then use the pressure cooking function. There are lots of presets on this, or you can use the manual settings.Now -- besides these wonderful meals I've already written about -- I'm getting so excited about making my own yogurt and cottage cheese (both of which are always in our refrigerator). I would advise those of you who will be making items that don't require the pressure top (like maybe soups, or steamed veggies) to buy the glass cover for the pot. The normal cover works fine, but I like to take a peek through the glass at things that are simmering in there.And this pot makes rice and congee, too. (Haven't tried it for those things yet.) It's a fast cooker, a slow cooker, a rice cooker. There's just so much it does to make dinner more wonderful and delicious.Anyway...if you've been on the fence about this item...let me just knock you over. Get one. It's amazing."
5.0 out of 5 stars,Love this Instant Pot.  We have been using it almost every day since we got it.  Right now it is cooking up some barbeque for dinner.  The 6 quart is good for a family of 4 or less.  Any more people and you may want to look at upgrading to one of the 8 quart models
1.0 out of 5 stars,"Bought a second instant pot as a gift. It has never ever worked. Opened a help ticket.  Provided detailed information. They closed my ticket because they said I didn’t provide enough information, without telling me what information they needed. Trying again but these people are not standing behind their product at all. I have an instant pot that works well. This one just doesn’t. They are not standing behind their products.  Contacting them is a virtual nightmare."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"We ordered the instapot with some skepticism.  My wife uses the crock pot a lot, and we were intrigued by the fact that you could get crockpot goodness in a fraction of the time.  The pot came with directions that were hard to understand.  Found better suggestions for how it works on the internet.  Also recipes.  There is no instruction on how to figure the amount of time.  Our first effort was to cook a frozen game hen.  the instruction on the internet said it would take about 50 minutes total and it did.  Since then we have tried several other dishes.  The stainless pot is easy to clean even after using the sauté feature.  It can be used like an all-in-one crock pot with the sauté feature.  We will still use the crock pot once in a while when there's a whole day to wait for the meal, but the instapot is going to replace a lot of the crock pot cooking.Jim"

5.0 out of 5 stars,"Okay, so I had been looking at this item for the past few months, but wasn't certain if I really needed it.  Until it went on sale!  Then, I had no excuse not to buy one.  I used it for the first time today.  It's incredibly easy to use, just read the directions and you're all set.  The only issue that I had is that it makes no noise. After I put my pork roast in the instant pot, I set the timer and stared at it for a few minutes, waiting.  There was no noise and the outside of the pot was at room temperature, so I assumed that it was not working.  I checked on it several times that hour and it remained quiet and cool to the touch.  When the time indicator reached zero, I let it cool down...and my pork roast was perfect!  This is my newest favorite kitchen gadget."
1.0 out of 5 stars,"I had issues with this on a regular basis. Food spilled all over the counter top and sprayed all over the kitchen. First the issue was intermittent and I thought it was something I was doing wrong. Over time, it started having mostly issues and would spray food all over the kitchen."
1.0 out of 5 stars,"To be able to cook a roast or corned beef, one would need to cut it up before cooking it. Who would want to cut the meat up in smaller pieces while it's still raw? Not a nice way to present it to your guests. Would have thought a 6-qt. pot would have been large enough. The box says it comes w/instructions. Unfortunately there were no instructions and the bags around all the merchandise seem to have been opened previously to receiving this item. They were all ripped open. Not interested in using a product that is not new when ordering it as new. Very disappointed w/size and condition of product."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"We have only used the 8 qt unit for about 6 items and have done corn 3 times with good results. The only negative so far is the amount of time it takes to get the unit pressurized and depressurized which adds 10 minutes to the total process. So the trade off of using boiling water versus the Instant Pot is flavor versus time. The 1st time we made stew it was not soft enough so we added 7 minutes to the time. The second we programmed it with the extra time and it came out perfect, so there is a learning curve involved. We have created our own little book with both time and procedure, so we know what the set up is for the different items to be cooked next time around.You have to use the pot several times to get a clear understanding of the sequence of the front panel controls which may not be user freindly for some people. Its like learning to use a controller on a new satellitte installation. you need to do it several times before you can implement what you want without going back to the manual.The constuction is excellent, but the 8 qt is quite heavy and it could be difficult to move around the kitchen for some people especially the 10 qt.size. The only note of caution is in using the pessure release valve,.which one needs to make sure your fingers are away from the steam jet.to prevent getting a scalding burn - so we now rotate the unit so we have clear visibilty when activating the steam valve."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"Purchased this based on a friend's recommendation.  This is my first time using the pressure cooking method and I have to say it is quite fun!  I don't think I would say it is a big time saver since pressure cooking requires the device to ramp up and create the pressure seal before the actual cooking time begins and then there is sometimes (depending on recipe) time after the cook time completes where the device then has to come down in temp and the pressure seal to be released.The pressure cooker method is not as ""one and done"" as using a slow cooker; most recipes I've tried require browning the meat first or doing a sauté before and/or after the pressure cooking is completed.  But the method does make for some great full flavored meals with meat that is very moist and tender.  And although I haven't tried the feature, I do like that there is a slow cooker option.Overall it is a fun little device to add another cooking option to my kitchen.  It took a little learning curve to become familiar with all the buttons and options on this thing - but after the first use I figured out most of it."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"Like how quick and quiet it is. I use it mainly for cooking meats right from the freezer. I kinda wish I had bought a larger one, my frozen chicken /roasts are a tight fit. Mine holds 3 xlFrozen chicken breast. Wasn’t aware of the only fill 2/3 full instructions when I ordered it. We have a family of 3 to cook for if you have more than that I would go up to the next size."
5.0 out of 5 stars,I LOVE THE INSTANT POT!!  This pot is pure magic!  As someone who really hates to cook... I was skeptical.  Kept hearing about it from my camping friends and decided to give it a try.  Well... I've cooked more since I got this than I have in 40 years!!  Everything is so easy and turns out great.  The stainless steel pot makes clean up a breeze!  I love it so much now I have 2!  Had to buy the bigger one just to make more stuff!!  This one will go camping with us as I'm to the point where I use it every single day!  It is worth it for the hard boiled eggs alone... 4 min and you have PERFECT eggs where the shells  just slide off!!  Seriously!  You can make pretty much everything in this pot!  I made my first homemade cheesecake!  Yes  CHEESECAKE!  and it turned out fabulous!!  Get this pot.. you will never cook any other way again...
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I waited all year for this baby to go on sale for Black Friday. I'd heard so many good things about this Instant Pot and I couldn't wait to try it. At first glance it can be a little intimidating with all it's buttons and functions and the big, fat instruction guide. I would recommend reading through the instructions carefully for the first time use, especially with emphasis on the different releases and how they work. I failed to do so as I somehow thought it would be wise to just dive in and explore it. I almost burned my fingers off not realizing how much steam would be released when you do a quick release, or what that really meant. Definitely make sure it is not right under hanging cabinets when you do a quick release or the wood can get damaged. In any case, my honey lime jalepeno stew meat was juicy and fall-apart tender in only 1 hour's time so I am an extremely happy customer. I am so happy to get rid of my crockpot and use this now instead for much quicker meals. It's easy to get used to once you've used it a few times. I'd say it took me a day of playing around to feel fully confident using it. I am really impressed with this little powerhouse of a machine. I plan to make plenty of stews, soups, curries, and casseroles with it in the near future! I highly recommend it."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This and a small coffee grinder changed my ways. I came here, to this 55+ building, too young. But in my defense I was fleeing a neighborhood where my opposition to n'er do wells made n'er do wells want to harm me for adamantly being in their way.They say ""get a dog."" I say ""let the cougar roam."" I'm not going to buy affection. I enjoyed Samuel Beckett's Endgame and will not furnish my ego with the three legs of God.I have become aware that a great many nostrils moving through my hallway must pause and acknowledge here, near here, that the love of food is paramount.I did not know I could cook captivating and soothing foods. I did not know I could be the grandma in the hall.I could shade my eyes and my ears. But the loving kindness of food pervades, and with these simple tools, some nourishing foods, some herbs and some spices, I can inoculate the sinuses in the hallway of sadness."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"It was overwhelming at first and I thought I was in a cock-pit.  Now I have had this for about a month I absolutely love it and it is quite easy and understandable. I love that it sautees, and then you add remaining ingredients.  I loved the chile I made and clean up was easy!  The stainless steel insert browns nicely, and then the steam helps remove the crusted remains.  I made corn bread in it, and I didn't realize it wouldn't brown. Tasty, but just looks different. Boiled eggs come out fantastic.  For our farm fresh eggs, the eggs peel easily and the inside has more of creamy and no green glow around the yolk edge.  I love soft boiled eggs, too, and Instant Pot gets them just right. Flavors are more enhanced, too.I haven't tried my own tried and true recipes yet.  I recommend getting the Instant Pot cookbook with this. otherwise you won't know how long to cook your meal.Actual cooking time for flavorful chile - 10 minutes but took another 20 to let the steam flow out.My family loves that I'm trying new recipes and with easier cleanup, it's worth it."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Awesome........ I was sitting on the lawn chair when ups pulled up.  YAY. Took pictures of him bringing me the box.So I did the test like the instant pot app had. Step by step instructions.Then..... I did the saute on the pork loin, then added the onions and garlic, and broth.  I did the 55 minutes on the timer per one of the reviews from the recipe app.Omg. The house smells delish. The pork loin is falling apart tender, I added a potatoe and even put in the apple.Awesome.The steam release works great, I opened it with a push of my tongs.I think my crock pot is going into cold storage, along with my casserole crock. Can't wait to try the yogurt button and rice.  Wow.  Love this to the moon.I added the picture of after the saute."
1.0 out of 5 stars,"I got my air fryer lid for father's day and I was excited to use it. First use? Fries of course and they were okay. Second use? Wings, which ended up being really good. Nice and crispy. Then I noticed the basket was peeling. It had been used twice and rinsed off once. Now I have a basket that looks like a metallic Dalmatian.  What a piece of garbage. I'd love to just send the entire back but there's no option to do so from Amazon. Ugh."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love this pot so much! I make all sorts of stuff in it, it saves time. One thing is it is a bit heavy when moving the whole pot. You do need to read directions several times before use. And some directions/ instructions I feel are not complete or clear. I had to figure out somethings on my own. I suggest playing around with it a few times. But other then that I really do love this pot. I have had it for a few months now."
3.0 out of 5 stars,"The slow cooing feature on this pot is horrible, its only capable of warming those little meatballs you serve at a party. very disappointed in this feature. I had red gravy i was going to cook from Friday night into Sunday morning but the pot on slow cook did not have the heat to percolate the gravy. Keep your crock pot for slow cooking bc this instant pot can not do the job on slow cook. Now the saute feature on low would have taking care of slow cooking the gravy but your limited on the timer to 30 minutes. Instant Pot i hope you are reading the reviews bc the pot needs some fine tuning. I am however satisfied with the pressure cooking feature , cooked a deer roast in 60 min, came out so tender."
5.0 out of 5 stars,I wasn’t sure how I’d feel about this product until I used it. It is AMAZING! I can’t even get over the fact that you can cook an entire meal in 20 mins. My kids are super active and this has really become a life saver.I’ve gotten some great recipes from Pinterest and everything has turned out wonderful. I added a couple of photos from some things I’ve made.This pot really has great safety features as well. The pressure release can be a little loud at first and I’d release it where there is nothing directly above it (cabinets etc.) otherwise it gets full of wet steam and you’ll have to wipe it down.Once you get used to using this you’ll love it!
3.0 out of 5 stars,"Nice product but I'm not sure it's as great as all the hype.  Time will tell.  We've cooked 5 or 6 meals in it so far.  I'm not overly impressed with the cooking speed.  I was expecting it to far exceed conventional methods.  It doesn't.  I have two other complaints:  1)  The seal really soaks up odors of what has been cooked in the instapot.  We made BBQ ribs that called for ""liquid smoke"".  The smell is strong now in the seal and does not wash out.  I hope future meals do not take on the flavor.  2)  Our instapot came with a broken condensation collector.  It's bad enough that the engineering is such that it is so easy to break.  When I requested a replacement from Instapot cutomer support, they required 4 photos and my phone number.  Providing this was annoying and I feel like it was an excessive onus on me for such a small item.  I feel like one email should have been all the effort required on my part."
1.0 out of 5 stars,"This would be an amazing product if it was still functional. I loved it for about 5 uses, and then it just completely stopped functioning. I made sure to take proper care of it and follow each and every instruction, I genuinely enjoyed this product for the short period of time it was working. The next time I plugged it in and went to use it nothing happened, there was no display on the screen, it didn't work in any outlet. I tried to contact the manufacturer about this to no avail. I would not recommend purchasing this product, you can find similar pressure cooker/slow cooker combination appliances from other brands that will hopefully last more than 5 uses."
5.0 out of 5 stars,What can I say….I love my Instant Pot!  I have made so many receipts in this and don't have to be home when it's cooking.  I have even made hard boiled eggs.  Perfect ones….the shell comes off so easy….everytime!  I have such a busy life and this works so well for that.  I picked this brand because it has the stainless steel removable pot; which is a healthier way to go than the teflon coated aluminum…plus has longevity.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Stainless steel bowl is awesome. This is perfect size for one or two people. 700w is also better for working with if we lose power here in FL to operate with our back up generator, RV, or solar lithium setups. Only wish it had a exact digital degree temp control like my 6qt Cosori cooker. But low, medium , high settings for temp/pressure on this 3qt I can still get almost everything done. We love the smaller footprint of counter space, probably 30% smaller height and width.  We recommend. Loved the great deal on Prime Day too!"
1.0 out of 5 stars,"Worse than my mom's 1967 pressure cooker. Several hours and multiple resets....unable to get it to get up to pressure. Reinstalled seal, reset unit multiple times, restarted entire cooking process to include saute' to get food up to temperate. After 2.5 hours still not at pressure (no errors on screen and valve both indicate proper seal....) unit counts down about 1 sec every minute..... or so. $25,10 year old crock pot faster and more reliable. Best guess is to get food boiling (understand saute' has a 30 minute timer), jiggle the top until it seals and cross your fingers. Will update if unit starts working.Update 2/10/2018 - Here we go again. Saute' till hot multiple resets - pressure but no timer.  Replugged in multiple times."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Bought this as a gift for my sister, because I already have one and love it!!  I use mine for a great many things at least three times a week.  Super easy to use, to clean, and there are recipes all over the internet.  She's excited to try hers!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"We have used this dozens of times since we bought this.  I grew up with an old fashioned pressure cooker with the jiggly regulator that my parents would use all the time.  So I am very happy to see they added a microcontroller and sensors to this old standard.  I takes the old pots from a risky method of cooking to a set-and-forget way of making great food in record time.  We have made many chilis, soups, roasts, and sauerkraut with pork in this pot, and the only thing that doesn't come out perfectly each time is the roasts, and I think it's more my fault than the cooker.  Chilis work the best in a pressure cooker because all the flavors come out and blend in 90 minutes for what usually takes 4 hours or longer in a slow cooker.  The steel pot is removable and can be washed in the dishwasher.  Ours is still shiny like the day we bought it.  We don't really use the plastic utensils that came with it since we use ""real serving spoons"" with it."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I resisted this purchase for a year. I heard all the hype from friends and family but honestly thought I don’t need another kitchen gadget.I received an amazon gift certificate, and since I had everything I could want after Christmas, I thought maybe it was time to find out what all the talk is about.The day it arrived I scoured the cupboards for something to cook. I tried a simple penne pasta recipe found on the web. It was amazing. I’m not usually big on pasta, but the sauce was inside each penne, the pasta was cooked perfectly. We ate all the leftovers which never happens! In the first week I have tried chicken soup stock, minestrone soup, beef stroganoff, cream of mushroom soup, and salsa chicken. Every dish has been very simple, and very delicious. I love using only one pot to sauté, and cook the meal. So many less pots to wash. I love the heavy stainless steel inner pot. Not a fan of non stick coatings that eventually peel. Overall I am in love with this new toy, I really didn’t think I could possible love it so much! I would buy it again in a heartbeat!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Where has this been all my life?  I was skeptical even after so many people bought and used the Instapot but finally after getting a great deal on a 3 qt one I figured I'd give it a shot.  Instantly hooked.  I've made pork baby back ribs to die for as the second dish I created in it and realized I needed the larger size for when my family comes to visit.  Now I've made a pork roast, beef roast and more ribs.  And, I've dropped red potatoes in both during the cooking of the meat and in the liquid remaining after and both have made amazing mashed skin on potatoes.  I highly recommend this product.  Just make sure to pay close attention to the times and you may have to play with those a bit depending on the types of roasts or sizes that you prepare but you will get great flavor every time."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought this Instant Pot with the idea that I would try it several times before deciding whether or not to keep it. I live in a small space and this needed to replace my crock pot and at least one other kitchen appliance you be worthy of the space. I bought a 3qt Mini-Duo for just people.Well,  I love it!  I've made spagetti, chili,  a whole chicken,  meatloaf,  hard boiled eggs, biscuits and cornbread in the Instant Pot and all came out great!  I've also used it as a slow cooker with great results.One caveat in most online recipes... they don't include the time to pressurize or depressurize when cooking.  Not a problem if you're aware of the additional time (10-15 minutes to pressurize and the same to depressurize).If you're considering getting one,  go for it."
3.0 out of 5 stars,"In July 2019, I bought the CrockPot version of InstantPot.  It was amazing - I could throw anything in it and come back in a bit and have a meal.  No problems, no participation required of me besides putting food in and taking it out.  But unfortunately, after a year of near-daily use, the thing quit working due to a known issue.  Irritated, I replaced it with the ""real deal""....the Instant Pot Duo.I HATE this thing.  I gave it three stars - because in the end I am getting food out of it - but what a freaking pain in the you-know-what!  Everything that I have tried to cook in this thing stops at LEAST once because the food is burning to the bottom of the pot.  Sometimes multiple times.  With the stopping, stirring, scraping, and repressurizing involved, I may as well be cooking in a pan on the stove.  These are the EXACT SAME recipes that I was making in the CrockPot without any struggle whatsoever.All-in-all, I would rather buy a CrockPot every year, if that's what it takes.  Because this InstantPot has not been a value-added transaction so far and is spending more and more time in the cupboard because I just can't face dealing with it and it's incessant complaining!!!"
4.0 out of 5 stars,"Great multi cooker.  I really like the pressure cooker feature.  It’s much easier to monitor pressure compared to the stove top pressure cookers.  Works great for hard and soft boiled eggs, pork shoulder, spaghetti, cooking rice, etc. The only thing this did not do well was as a slow cooker.  I tried to make a red bean soup dessert and used the slow cooker function and had it on all day, approximately 10 hours or longer.  The red adzuki beans were only about 1/3 cooked compared to a slow cooker.  I had to take them out and boil them on the stovetop to finish."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"I like using my Instant Pot, and would recommend it highly.  HOWEVER, one thing I really, really dislike (not a strong enough word--alright, HATE) is the ""Keep Warm"" feature that I have to turn off every single time I use it.  It should be the other way around... It should only go on if I want to use it.  I am so mad about this feature I am tempted to give it a two star rating!!!!  Otherwise, I use the Instant Pot a lot and like it.  But THAT ""Keep Warm"" feature can go  bye, bye!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've only used this pot a few times and I'm already SO happy that I bought it.  It cooked an whole chicken in 30 minutes...and it was tender and juicy.  I will say that I seem to be sacrificing a little bit of flavor with the pressure cooker setting.  Probably because it's not stewing in the spices for hours.  I think maybe using a marinade and letting it sit for the day would help.  Still worth every penny.The 8 qt size is HUGE, so make sure you have space for it.  I thought I did and was wrong.  I had to store it without the top on, and shuffle several things around.My absolute favorite thing about this product is that I can brown my meat before I start the slow cooker or pressure cooker cycle.  I browned a brisket, put in some broth and seasoning, pressure cooked for 50 minutes, then took out the brisket and set it to sauté to make the gravy.  All in one pot.  Awesome."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This was the third Instant Pot I purchased, for the primary purpose of preparing side dishes and/or desserts, such as rice pudding, which is one of my favorite dishes.  It's stunningly easy in the 3-quart, sort of like a dump dessert.  Each time I've made it, it comes out very nice.  I also like to prepare certain veggies, such as asparagus, to steam as a side dish.  Both this pot and my 6-quart fully cover my meals on just about any given night.  Love it."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"I would go with a lesser unit in the future that has more control over the cooking process. White rice ""Rice"" setting is about 12 minutes cooking time. To cook brown rice you have to do a second ""Rice"" cooking to get the 24 minutes required. Would be nice to control of time and tempature that is offered in lesser unites."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I can't believe I cooked without a pressure cooker before.  I'm on the Whole 30 (Whole30) and cooking was taking up way too much time each week.  The Instant Pot means I don't have to use the stovetop, everything cooks faster, and I don't have to constantly monitor something.  It's been a game changer for meal planning.  Everyone should have an Instant Pot.  I bought the 8 quart so I could make large batches of things to eat during the week.  I'm glad I bought this size.  I also ordered a steamer that fits perfectly inside for perfectly steamed vegetables."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've had my instant pot for 2 weeks shy of a year now.  I use it at least twice a week.  I use this as a rice cooker, pressure cooker, and occasionally as a slow cooker.  I have not tried making yogurt.  I prefer it over other devices as I can easily remove the pot and wash it without fear of dropping a heavy crock with slippery soapy hands that will break.  I have had some trouble in the past week with the gasket not sealing correctly, but it does say in the manual that the gasket will need periodic replacement.My typical dishes I make in the instant pot are meats.  I can have a pot roast from fridge to table in 2 hours.  I have used it for soups as well as cooking sweet potatoes and spaghetti squash.Over the past year the pot has held up well.  The unit itself is not to be immersed in water, but does have a removable power cord.  Programming is easy selecting between high, low, or normal pressure.  You can set a delay start time and then set the cooking time. While cooking there is some steam that comes out of the pressure and the overflow valve and it makes a gentle hiss/hum sound so you know it's cooking.  When it's done there is a beep, but not something you have to respond to.  It then goes into warm mode.  I've set things to cook on slow cook and went to work and come home to find them on warm for 45 minutes.  Cleaning is easy.  I'm not a fan of teflon as it will flake off so I'm thrilled that this does not have teflon.  For really tough suck on food, I fill with water and drop in 6 denture cleaning tablets.  The next morning I wash it out and store it.  The gasket is easy to get off and on for cleaning.  The only difficult part of cleaning is the drip container on the back to catch excess condensation.  I've only had to clean it once when I over filled the instant pot.All and all, this instant pot has changed the way we cook.  It's great for this working mom."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"RUNAWAY STEAM RELEASE...Here is what I did to cause this... If your anything like me , I can save you some trouble... I received this yesterday (Sunday) and I tried it last night...  I looked at the manual, put the condensation catcher on, put A GLASS of water in the pot and turned it on.  Set it to ZERO minutes.  I wanted it to come up to STEAM and shut off immediately... Well I GOT steam, trouble is it was coming out of the quick release valve... Hmmm... Figured I was doing something wrong, so I gave up, lets try again tomorrow... This morning looked over everything, pulled the release valve off and made sure there was no dirt or foreign objects in the valve , NADA... Started it up and AGAIN steam out of the release valve...HERE is whats happening.  Because I ONLY put in A GLASS of water, the steam pressure is coming up TOO quickly and the pressure detector is not detecting it quick enough...  So the quick release valve is acting as a SAFTEY valve and releasing the steam so the machine won't blow up...  I read about this online.  So I put in a quart of water, and voila , problem solved... The steam builds up a bit slower and the pressure detector is regulating the steam better.  I think this is a MINOR flaw in the pot.  with most cooking (Larger quantities of food and water ) most people would not even see this...I originally ( 1 hr ago)  gave this ONE star and was getting ready to ship it back...  Updated the rating to 3 stars from 1... This IS a problem in the, pot but I can live with it...  I am also going to test this with the LOWER steam setting... Stay tuned...So I tried the STEAM setting on LOW PRESSURE, With 1/2 quart, less than what the successful run had...  The pot came up to pressure and held for 2 minutes, and then the quick release started to release steam...  Mind you there was NOTHING being steamed... AND while reading the book, the STEAM setting runs at FULL POWER CONTINUOUSLY...  So while I understand what is happening, It is becoming more clear that this ITEM is flawed... again Stay tuned...So Ive cooked soup , yesterday and today... I only make vegetable soup so I don't have to cook it very long. For a big pot today , I set it on soup and 10 minutes. Well it took about 20 minutes to get up to steam... While I was watching it I changed the time to 1 minute. When it finished the one minute , it took about 20 minutes for the steam release valve to open, and the soup was perfect.  40 minutes to make soup with no intervention... This is great!!!"
3.0 out of 5 stars,"Everyone at work was talking about these so I finally bought one.  It is amazing in how fast it can cook frozen meat. Basically, it does what it says it does.  I bought it as a replacement to my slow-cooker. For that I don't like it.  My slow cooker was long and oval and I could cook larger pieces of meat. I use it in a pinch when I've forgotten to defrost meat.  Beyond that, I haven't found myself using it much.  I also find cleaning the lid less than easy."
2.0 out of 5 stars,I  have a  lot of problems with my instant pot pressurizing. 90% of the time I  have to stop the cooking process and fiddle with the pressure valve to make sure it activates. I  do like the way it cooks but it's no time saver for me because of the issues with the lid. Maybe I  got a  dud.  If not for this issue I probably would have given it a  5 star rating. Maybe I  should look into returning this one.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is a belated review after using the IP for more than 4 years. After about 2 years,i replaced the silicone ring but the seal is still not good - it sometimes does not go into pressure and continue to let off steam. i tried everything in the end i had to replace a new one. this time, i bought warranty! so, despite the quality issue, i still have to sing praises of this amazing kitchen appliance. I am one of those people who don't read manuals. this is replacement for my old pressure cooker. i use it like the way i had made use of my old p cooker - only as a pressure cooker. yes, i forgot this IP is so much more powerful and multi functional than my old p cooker.It is not until when i was looking to buy a microwave and chance upon an online video by someone promoting how IP can 'sort of' replace microwave. she showed how using the steam function could heat up food. It isn't as instantaneous as microwave (depending what you heat up: about 5-10 mins in IP vs 30sec - 2 mins in Microwave). It isn't as convenient as microwave either but after weighing the pros and cons, i think i can live with a little inconvenience and waiting a little few more mins to eat healthier. I will not go into the specifics of using microwave because there are a plethora of articles online about the ills of microwave although not that i necessarily support all of them (the radiation is so little for the amount of use at home to be harmful) and i probably will continue using a microwave if i have one but my current kitchen did not come built in with one. With the IP, i am glad it provided me an option so I can do with one less kitchen gadget in my kitchen.So with this video, i began to find more videos and explore the many creative uses of the IP - there are SO MANY videos and reviews out there by independent IP lovers who share their tips and recipes on using IP (sure beat reading the boring manual). The other reason i was shopping for a microwave was to make pop corn. Well, i learnt on these videos that IP can pop popcorn too! Some of these videos are so detailed and many down to the science of perfecting the flavor, texture using different types of oil, organic etc etc.A couple super legit websites that I found are ""sisters under pressure"" blog;  Traditional Cooking school by ""gnowfglins""Btw, I tried popping commercial (store-bought) microwavable popcorn in IP - they didn't pop - so you would want to follow the recipes to only pop raw kernels when using the IP.My IP now has now moved from inside the cabinet to a permanent spot on my counter (like how your microwave would have taken a prominent real estate in your kitchen).My favorite use for the IP: making soup, reheating food (everyday multiple times), defrosting and cooking meat usually a roast.I got the 6 qt 7-in-1 on Black Friday 2016 at a deal - just under $70 on Amazon  years ago. Today it is only $49!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I jumped on the Instant Pot train after my brother-in-law decided to bring us homemade beef stew made in his. First, I was impressed with the handle and the overall transportability of this product. Unplug it and go! Then plug it back in when you've arrived and you have a warm (if not hot) meal ready for the people hosting. Second, I tried another brand of Multi-cooker first and the darn thing never made one meal due to error codes and what-not-- buying the brand in this case ended up being the way to go. Third, this thing is so simple and easy to use. Yes, there is a little trial-and-error with cooking specific recipes, but that's how cooking goes. I throw my ingredients in and all of a sudden I have a delicious broccoli-cheddar soup, or honey-sriracha chicken, or vegetarian chili! It takes approximately 10 minutes after setting it for it to heat up and gain enough pressure to cook. Then there is the cooking time. Then the pressure release time. Add about 15-20 minutes to each cooking time to know how long the recipe will take OVERALL in the Instant Pot. The great thing is that you can walk away, do some schoolwork or housework, then come back to eat. I don't have to watch the stove or anything. Perfect for a busy schedule!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm 67 years old & have use pressure cookers for many years and this is by far the best. The old school pressure cookers required great strength to open after the pressure was released making them a real pain to use. I can open this pressure cooker with my little finger after the pressure release button drops. When I make stew in this cooker I don't have to ever cut the meat with a knife, just lifting the meat with serving spoon & poking it a couple times is all it takes. If you have used old school pressure cookers in the past & gone through the opening process you can forget about any problems getting this one open. If you garden & can this size pressure cookers is one of the bigger ones now a days, while not as big as the old school cookers of the past, I'm sure you will toss the old monster out the first time you use this one. Another great feature is instead of having to heat this on your stove top and flip a pressure regulator to the correct pressure and then spend much time adjusting the heat so that the regulator wiggles so many times in a minuet  you just plug this in the outlet push a couple buttons and walk away until the alarm goes off. If you miss the alarm it doesn't matter the unit will automatically go into a keep warm mode until your ready to eat. One more thing, after I wrote this review a potential buyer said they didn't see a dedicated button for making yogurt on the unit and asked if you could make yogurt, well I consulted the manual & replied that there were no recipes for yogurt & I wasn't sure., but then I noticed the manufacturer does say Yogurt Maker so now I took a look at the machine and the biggest most noticeable button says Yogurt, so there is a dedicated button for Yogurt just no recipes included."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"My Instant Pot Duo Plus is wonderful!  I've waited a long while to get one but they were 1/2 off on Black Friday.  I bought 2, one for us and one for the kids.  They work full time, have a baby and little time for prep.  I am determined to learn several things each week.  My first recipe was a bean/ham hock soup.  The flavors were amazing.  Yesterday we did boiled eggs & rice.  Both were fantastic!  We always have fresh eggs and peeling can be an issue.  With this pot they peel beautifully.  I have donated 2 rice cookers & 2 crock pots because this pot does it all."
3.0 out of 5 stars,"While I am appreciative of my air fryer lid, I’m very disappointed in the coating of the basket. I’ve only used it twice since purchase and receipt and followed all the directions. Using the appropriate non scratch cleaning sponge the basket peeled away in an area.I love using my Instantpot and have been happy with it but am not so happy with this addition."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've had this for about a month and I love it. I got the 6qt and it's the perfect size. Big enough to cook a whole chicken, small enough so it doesn't take up too much counter space. I use it 3 to 4 times a week. I've cooked pot roasts with carrots and potatoes,a whole chicken with Greek seasoning, short ribs and chicken thighs with potatoes and tomatoes. I bought The Ultimate Instant Pot Cookbook by Simon Rush to go with it, it's been helpful.It's easy to clean, and that is nice. The instructions for use are easy to understand, I've found it easy to use.I live in an apartment and this pot is perfect for me."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"OK so I didn't jump on the instant pot bandwagon because I assumed it was a bandwagon. I have limited space in my kitchen and the 6qt isn't small so I was hesitant.  Amazon had a warehouse deal so the wife and I decided to buy one and jump in.Since then, I would say 60% of our dinners have been made in this.  I've made breakfast in it (overnight oats are stupid easy to arrange so that you just pop the top and eat with no further prep. Great for getting the family out the door in a hurry), snacks (hard cooked eggs are FAST and easy), and we made our corned beef and cabbage in it for St Patty's this year- in about two hours.It's easy to clean, it's really easy to use, it looks sharp (which is good- ours never gets put away because it's in near-constant use), and it's weirdly quiet.  I love it and I didn't want to."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I didn't know much about the instant pot when I purchased it, but I saw it half price on Amazon and decided to take a chance. Not only do I feel like I got a steal, but I do think that I would've been just as pleased had I payed full price. I'm very frugal, so to me, that says a lot about the quality and usefulness of this product. I use it a couple times a week, thanks to the myriad of free recipes on food blogs. I've also adapted some of my favorite recipes to cook in it. It's a wonderful luxury item and a worthy investment to those who try to cook all of their meals at home. It's sturdy as heck (I think it weighs like 15 lbs, no joke -- better start lifting weights! :) and has a cute jingle when you turn it on. I'm a huge fan."
1.0 out of 5 stars,1st pot came broken and so did the 2nd pot.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love this Mini 3-quart Instant Pot.  The perfect size for a couple, or for a single person.  If your situation is either of these, get THIS model - you will be happy you dis not get the larger model.TIP:  You CAN easily decrease larger recipes to smaller ones based on portions, but you should  NOT change the original recipe's time & pressure settings when using the smaller Mini 3-quart model (confirmed this with the Instant Pot Customer Service Team)."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"The Instant Pot is easy to use, and extremely versatile.I love that it's a slow cooker and a high and low pressure cooker all in one, with the ability to sear your foods right inside it before making roasts and soups.That means you can deglaze right in the pot, saving yourself from dirtying another pan and having to transfer the juices and veggies to your pressure cooker. It's very handy!This is the most useful cooking appliance I own. If given the choice between keeping this or my stove, I'd pick my Instant Pot.It has so many different abilities, I have only gotten around to trying half of them.There have been no problems or glitches whatsoever with this machine in the two months I have had it.As someone who hates wasting time and effort in the kitchen, I never got around to making things like ham and bean soup before.This machine is so fast and efficient that I have made Goulash, ham and bean soup, and the most tender pot roast I have ever eaten in it!If you are on the fence about buying one, I strongly urge you to pick one up.The amount of money I can save by buying cheaper cuts of meat and making them soft and flavorful in this machinehas made the price I paid for this completely worth it.I was skeptical about all the high reviews raving about this machine, but it's not just hype or influenced reviewing.It really is a great little pot you'll want to tell people about.I wholeheartedly recommend this handy little device!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"COOKING TIME DOES NOT INCLUDE THE HEATING UP TIME!! Make sure you understand that when recipe says cook in 10 minutes you have to add the time it takes to heat up and pressurize. I may be a novice to this information, but I was shocked that there was a little “misinformation” going on... either way - Great Product. Cooks food fast, even for 10 min warm up, easy to throw in dishwasher, and parts are cheap to replace. Can’t go wrong - just do it."
4.0 out of 5 stars,this item is a 8 Qt Instant Pot and it has replaced 2 pieces of kitchen appliances - my rice cooker and stock pot.this does the job faster than i was expecting but that just means i can eat quicker!!!the only thing that would be nice is an instruction manual on how to cook or how to think about how to cook with this appliance. just diving into the app is not enough straight out of the box. thanks the internet that some folks have learned how to work this thing to make it easier for a novice user. if there were better instructions it would have gotten a 5 rating all across the board.
1.0 out of 5 stars,"When it is working, the machine is great but it won't last long and the owners don't value Warranty. They will tell you there is warranty coverage for the first year but once it fails they will ask you couple of information and they will never get back to you. Avoid buying this .... avoid buying this... Avoid buying this .... I bought it and it stopped working within 6 months and I had to a buy another Brand called 'Aroma ...'. There is a lady at the customer service who is the worst human being you will ever communicate with. She just makes decision and will not explain why. Luck aside, THIS IS NOT RELIABLE . Stay way from it as much as you can. Am filing complaint in all areas possible."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I'd love for there to be sub settings for rice types. I'd also prefer being able to change some settings on the fly instead of resetting. And I'd love the steam release to be more obvious so you don't forget to set it to avoid burning food, and for it to aim not at the cabinets above your pot.But it's an amazing kitchen tool, I suggest getting one, the right model for you, there are several."
5.0 out of 5 stars,Love this thing. We had a 6 quart but it was too big. This 3 quart is perfect to make 1 dinner for 2 and have 2 leftover lunch's. We make meals in one pot which makes clean up much easier. It is easy to use. The smaller size is nice and it fits great in our RV. It also works on our battery invert when we are camping off the grid.You may want to get extra seals. The seal picks up some food odors. Also the cord is short. But we still love this thing.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love it! Used it right away. Had already watched some YouTube videos and learned a lot before it came in.  Made buffalo wings immediately (I washed it first) because already had them on hand. My husband really liked them. They were very good and tender. Actual pressure cooker time for 2.5 pounds of wings was 8 minutes - I kind of guessed because of what I had learned.  It also takes a few minutes for the pressure to build (depending how much and what all you have in there) so that needs to be included in the time factor. Before pressure cooking I used its Saute feature to brown them just a little. Also briefly crisped them under broiler before adding sauce (don't do this too long - don't want to overcook).  Just like some people like to sometimes brown meats a little because the crockpot doesn't, same thing here. Only instead of hours, it was only minutes - and very tender. Decided to go ahead and get the 8 quart instead of 6 quart and glad I did. It can cook a whole chicken in about 20 minutes and if you want to do some batch cooking. I will be using this almost every week.  It is a 7 in one pot.  It is also a slow cooker, rice cooker, sautes etc. I had always stayed away from pressure cookers because of olden-day pressure cooker war stories.  So glad I went ahead and tried it!"
1.0 out of 5 stars,"I was so excited to finally pull the trigger on buying my insant pot for Christmas!  I opened it after the Christmas holiday all set to use my time off of work and have some fun.  I washed everything up and was all set. Thank God I didn't put any food in because when I turned it around to the back, there was a huge dent in the instant pot!! The packaging was not damaged but none the less the dent there.  I had to wait for UPS to be open so that I could send it back. Not so happy........"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Heard about this product on a podcast I listen to and then saw the 17,000 reviews or however many there were and decided to take the plunge. So happy that I did!Threw out the rice cooker and slow cooker after just a few days with this thing. I used to either: 1. take frozen meat out of freezer and place in fridge, now obligated to eat said food in a few days whether we were hungry for it or not, or 2. wake up and make breakfast AND dinner and throw it in the crockpot and let the thing run all day when nobody was home (being a fire bug, I was never very comfortable with this.Now we eat straight from frozen to plate in usually 20 to 40 minutes for most meals that we eat. I buy a lot of frozen individually wrapped items at costco. One of our favorite meals is salmon and a microwaved vegetable. No oil, no thawing, no falling apart teflon pan getting in our food.I simply pour half a bottle of bottled water in the bottom of the instant pot, put the little round steamer rack in (water just below the rack), place frozen salmon (covered in pepper, old bay blackened, salt and cilantro (10 seconds to shake all of these spices on)), turn on instant pot, press ""steam"" button and walk away! About 10 to 12 minutes of warmup time and about 7 to 8 minutes of steaming under pressure, release steam valve, open... And have some of the most moist salmon I've ever eaten! Bag of frozen steamable veggies takes 5 minutes in the microwave. Literally a super healthy meal from frozen to plate in like 20 minutes!Chicken breasts same thing except no steam rack, just toss them into the water in the bottom. I made pork ribs (youtube video showing apple juice and apple cider vinegar, starting in instant pot and finishing in oven to carmelize bbq sauce) and again, some of the best fall of the bone ribs I've ever made. Chicken wings with rub powder... short time, fall off bone delicious as well. Even made an apple crisp in the thing, and of course while not ""crispy"" right out of the pot itself, still amazingly tasty and could have finished off in a 450 degree oven for 5 or 10 minutes if I chose to, but I just wanted to eat :P. Made a meatloaf on the steam rack sitting on foil, again moist!Seriously, only had this thing for a few weeks now and it has become our nightly meal maker. I've gotten into the routine of taking out 2 round racks to place the top and pot on, after cooking, etc. You'll find your groove with the thing and there are a lot of options, but the learning curve is quick and you'll find how you like to use the thing. But for me, I wish I would have learned about this device years ago!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"How did I not know about this gadget for so long? I read some random recipe online that mentioned ""Instant Pot"", and I didn't know what that was so I Googled it. What I saw amazed me. My pupils dilated. The hairs on my arms tingled and raised up. I had to have it. So what if I have 6 crock pots, a Foreman grill, 2 rice cookers, and one of those TFal Opti-Grill thingies. This was different! This was new! Once on hand, I had to search for something to cook. IMMEDIATELY! What! Can! I! Make?! Dude, I don't even know what the first thing I made was. All I remember is I cleaned the thing up and immediately made brown rice. Brown rice. The only kind of rice I fail at time after time. And you know what? It was perfect. The next thing I wondered was .. gee .. can I cook frozen stuff in this thing. You know what? YES! I plopped a bunch of frozen chicken in the thing with some onions, garlic, and chicken broth .. and you know what? I was awesome. So far I've used it as a pressure cooker (fresh and frozen), a rice cooker, and a slow cooker. If the food didn't come out exactly right, it's because I'm just making it up as I go along because I'm too excited to keep trying stuff."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"When it was working, this pressure cooker was easy to use. I used it, at least, 3 times per week. I purchased it dec. 1, 2015 and sadly 2 days ago it just stopped working.(noPr) I followed the troubleshooting tips, nothing, i put in a work ticket per instructions. I quickly received a reply with a list of 8 steps to a ""simple"" test. The 1st item was to check the same items i told them i already did. Yes, the test was simple but the watching the time and logging what was happening for 30 mins was a bit much. You were also told to make of video of this happening with pictures of the lid showing the sealing ring(which i replaced by the way) and a picture of the silver label on the back of the pot along with the copy of your purchase invoice. So, no, i have never made a video of anything and at 63 years old i don't feel the need to start now! I will be replacing my pressure cooker, as soon as i can, but not with this brand! It's too bad that their customer service procedure was not as good as their pressure cooker!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"We have had the Instant Pot for a week now. I have cooked in it nearly every day. I've made black bean soup, PERFECT brown rice, roasts 2 nights, and pork chops with mashed potatoes. Every single dish was cooked to perfection. My husband swears that everything is more flavorful.I love the fact that with the black bean soup, after it's initial cook phase, I added veggies for another 7 minute cook. The veggies did not turn black like they do when cooking on the stove. The celery was still green, the carrots still orange, etc. For one of the roasts, I also added carrots and potatoes. The flavors were so good and they did not mix wit the roast. One thing my husband does not when cooking on the stove is that the carrots make everything taste like carrots. Not so in the instant pot, everything kept it's own taste and did not mix with the others foods.This is an absolute must in any kitchen! I may even get a second one, since with the roasts I had to cook the rice the traditional way so that they would be done at the same time."
5.0 out of 5 stars,I'm late to the instant pot addiction but glad I joined the craziness.  Of all the gadgets I have I use this weekly.. usually multiple times. I dont have to worry as much about defrosting meat for dinner.. in 10 min 2 full chicken breasts go from freezer to fully cooked! I'm still learning with it but I've only ruined 1 out of about 10 meals.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I had been thinking about purchasing an Instant Pot for quite some time. I love using my pressure cookers. I wasn’t sure if it was worth the price. What actually helped me decide, was the YouTube videos I’ve seen with people using them.It gave me ideas about what I could make. I also make rice often and would use the microwave for it, but it would always over flow. Some types of rice are hard to cook in the microwave. Such as brown rice. I am not crazy about boiling rice on the stove top. It is often over cooked & soggy. The instant pot is so easy. I even made black beans from scratch."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"There is not a good enough word to describe how much I love my Instant Pot.After ordering I spent about two weeks afraid to take it out of the box. Visions of exploded pressure cookers, and angry looking skin burns flooded my head.Needless to say, I was being ridiculous. This is seriously one of the greatest inventions known to man and hands down my most used kitchen appliance.  This can easily replace a rice cooker, slow cooker, steamer, regular pressure cooker, yogurt maker and more.I originally went with this brand because it was one of the only ones with a stainless steel insert as opposed to non stick, and also because it looked like I could get rid of quite a few appliances (haha, as if) and use this as a catchall.  It is very well made, has a large following and the maker provides decent customer service.The only small complaint would be that the timing sheet/ instructions given with the pot are way off, and I had to seach out other resources in order to get the most out of my pot.I used this  Instant Pot every single day for three months when I first started playing with it, didn't touch my oven/microwave or counter top oven in that entire time.  Originally I was afraid this wouldn't be very useful for someone who eats an entirely plant based diet but I was completely wrong.  Basmati rice in 4 minutes, perfectly cooked.  Vegan yogurt overnight at a fraction of the cost of buying it ready made,  soups, curries, tofu dishes,  steaming.. what can't this thing do?Definitely give it a try even if you are a little bit hesitant!To make your life easier I am going to link over to some resources that really helped me out with learning this appliance.Jill Nussinow also has a great website, and her books have been invaluable, she has the most reliable timing charts in her books and is very active on the Facebook plant based instant pot groups!

5.0 out of 5 stars,"This item is very versatile.  It does with it proclaims to do!  I love to cook and the Instant Pot makes cooking delicious meals fast and convenient. My priority is to make delicious, healthy meals and the Instant Pot definitely exceeds that expectation. It's attractive with a easy to use panel of button control options.  It's made from robust, quality material. The lid is easy to apply and remove once you get the hang of where to line it up, set and close securely. The removable, stainless steel pot has a durable, thick base and is surprisingly easy to clean as well as the lid. The remaining parts remain essentially clean, so a quick wipe is all that is required.  It has a small condensation cup in the back which collects water.  It's easy to remove and clean.  A nice design feature.The electrical cord is a generous length. Instructions are easy to follow and a quick reference guide is provided. The pressure cooker feature is simply awesome!  Cooks at warp speed without compromising the flavors and textures of the food.  I used to make cultured yogurt, so I look forward to using this option. I plan to purchase a second removable, stainless steel pot so I can remove the item cooked, set it aside, and continue cooking seamlessly. It's worth the cost in relation to meal preparation, cooking and time saved.  I've had the Instant pot for several months and it makes meats melt in your mouth, (lingua and chicken was incredible), Spanish rice divine (browned in pan initially) and beans to die for!  No need to soak the beans for hours!  If you love your pots and pans, kitchen appliances and gadgets and you actually use all of them like I do, you must add this to your pantry!  Your family and friends will thank you with lots of compliments to the Chef!"
3.0 out of 5 stars,"I put mine back in the box.  The ""Getting Started"" guide is terrible. Shows illustrations that are not accurate and nothing about when/whether to use the various modes for venting.  There are no recipes included so you're left to figure out even how to even cook rice in it.  Instructions to install the red ring, but there is already a clear ring installed.  Why two?  Nothing about how long you wait for pressure cooking to begin or end. Turns out brown rice will take 45 minutes--the same as my old-fashioned rice cooker!  Very disappointing ""out of the box"" experience. Not sure if I will keep it around."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Wow...what a difference this makes in preparing food!  So happy I got this.I’ve made roast, veggies and chicken breast and all turned out with great flavor.I will need a little more experience with timing as I’ve tended to overlook alittle. At first, it’s hard to imagine meats being fully cooked in such a short time.What it does is it makes anything and everything (except deep frying) so muchfaster and flavorful. I particularly love that meats are far more moist & juicy.Can’t wait to try Pasta next. My family loves pasta but I hate boiling and stirringand testing the noodles to get it right and using the Instant Pot sounds great!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I received the IP-DUO60 7-in-1 Instant Pot on 03/16/2016. I purchased it for two main reasons, Pot Roast and Corned Beef and Cabbage. I'm here to say it does an excellent job on both and I'm convinced it will do equally as well with other dishes. Now here's where I thought I might have a problem. When not in use I store the Instant Pot on a shelf next to the cellar stairs. This morning (07-19-2016) one of the three dogs thought it was OK to go poking around the shelf and somehow knocked the Instant Pot off the shelf and down the cellar stairs. FYI the stairs are cast cement. When I heard the racket I got up to investigate and was greeted by three dogs who denied any and all involvement in what had just happened. There at the bottom of the stairs was my Instant Pot with lid off and inner bowl out. My first thought was I'll have to go to Amazon and order a new one and maybe even upgrade to the 8 quart size. Not so fast, lets see if it still works. Brought it in the kitchen and added some water. Plugged it in and it came to life. After a few minutes it came up to pressure and did everything it was supposed to do none the worst for ware. I'm happy, the dogs are happy and corned beef and cabbage tonight."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased this with a gift card I received for Christmas. I purchased this model because it had a few more features. I have looked at them several times but decided I didn't need another appliance in my kitchen. Where would I keep it? I first tried some oatmeal(carrot cake oatmeal). It was delicious. My second try was a beef roast. I threw in some potatoes, carrots, and onions. It was absolutely fabulous. One hour and dinner was ready. Next I tried chicken and dumplings. Again, it was great and ready in 30 minutes. Beef vegetable soup was the best I have ever made. The broth was much clearer and it was also done in 30 minutes. Salisbury Steak & mashed potatoes and other 1-pot meals have been so good and clean-up is a breeze. There are tons of recipes with complete directions on Pinterest. I have used it to thaw meat on steam setting. I am still learning and am very excited with the things I have learned. It can stay on my counter. I use it more than any other appliance. It is a new way of cooking for me and I love it."
1.0 out of 5 stars,"our first pot worked for over a year without incident. then, when we started to use it more often if stopped cooking on high pressure, requiring almost double cooking times to complete the meal. Support was no help even after waiting over an hour to talk to someonr on the phone. we decided to get another instant pot-----What a mistake! this new pot would not cook on high pressure from the start. We returned it and will never buy another instant pot!!!!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,Awesome! Made some tough ethnic dishes and it handled it well when alternating between saute and the rice/ soup features!
5.0 out of 5 stars,"The Instant Pot has been a staple in my wife's cooking. She has expressed the ease she has had in preparing meals. I have been impressed with the short cook times, but with slow cook flavor. This pressure cooker is completely safe. Don't let pressure cooker horror stories scare you about this cooker. It has safety valves that prevent anything from going wrong."
3.0 out of 5 stars,"Just started using and being an old school cook (meaning I am old), I can't say that I am impressed.  Everyone told me how they loved theirs, but I didn't take into count the age difference (meaning they were much younger).  Most of the people I talked to never used the old-fashioned pressure cooker.  This product works fine, has lots of gadgets and of course a timer....all nice, but if you ever used the old fashioned pressure cooker, this is so much slower.  I will use it, but not the ""miracle"" fast cooker that I was expecting.  It's a new fangled twist on a good old fashioned stand-by.  If you have never used a old fashioned pressure cooker... buy the Instant Pot, you will like it."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"We bought the a different brand (Crock Pot) electric pressure cooker for our first pressure cooker because it was a little cheaper and I wish we would have went straight for the Instant Pot.  We use our Instant Pot every week.  It's great that you can saute some ingredients and then add more and either pressure cook or slow cook. It's great that this is also a slow cooker so it's not really another appliance, it will take the place of your slow cooker but do so much more.There are a few differences with the Crock Pot that might be worth considering if you're trying to decide.  This is slightly less easy to clean than the Crock Pot which has a nonstick coating but the coating in the Crock Pot did not hold up very well in my experience. The stainless steel pot has been very durable so far and should last a very long time.  It's also easy to find replacement parts for Instant Pot; this is probably my biggest gripe with the Crock Pot Express is that parts can only be purchased directly from Crock Pot, shipping isn't free and in my experience they're frequently out of replacement parts.  Both pressure cookers do a good job sauteing, pressure cooking and slow cooking with similar functionality; the two big differences in my opinion the nonstick vs stainless pot and parts availability/selection."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought this for one reason, rice. I am notorious for messing up rice. I have even messed up the microwave rice, how that is done, I have no idea. One cannot live off rice alone, so I began exploring. So many different things to make. Quinoa for meal prepping, sweet potatoes, and especially the perfect hard boiled egg! I just wish it came with a steamer basket. I have bought 2 on Amazon and neither one has fit properly."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased this pressure cooker earlier in the year but it's really only come into it's own in my house now that they holidays are upon us. Living alone it takes a bit of motivation to get me to cook in quantity so my use of the pressure cooker was limited until recently. It does a wondeful job with everything I've tried so far, but again, my use was limited.Over the holidays though I decided I'd be a good guest this year and bring some dishes along with me. This pressure cooker makes it easy, and yes, even fun. My latest was a super simple Kalua Pig recipe (thing Hawaiian style pulled pork). The local supermarket had a great sale and I ended up with a 12 pound butt. I decided to take half to Xmas dinner and cook half later.Because you really want to cook the pork down to the point that it'll shred easy with a fork a pressure cooker is great. It could take a day on the stove slow cooking, but in 100 minutes (and I probably could have done it in 90 but I wanted to be sure) I made short work of it.The Instant Pot IP-DUO60 7-1 isn't the lastest version, that's bluetooth enabled version that costs about twice as much. I live in a small apartment so I really, really didn't need to be able to control things from my couch; it's a few steps to the kitchen.The controls on the cooker are easy to use and fairly intuitive. A handy chart is included which I've put up on my fridge.I've not tried the autosettings yet as most of the things I've tried have been from recipes that include cooking times, but I've no reason to doubt they work. Generally I use the saute setting to brown my meat; works great. Then I add some liquid, seal it up, and set the time. In a very short time I've got a great meal.I have made both large quantities of single meats, like the Kalua Pig, as well as one point meals like a pork loin wit cauliflower (for mashing) with equal ease.This is an electric pressure cooker so it won't develop quite the pressure a stovetop model would thus cooking times are marginally longer. However cooking times are so much shorter than they might otherwise be (100 minutes vs all day for instance) that it's not going to be noticeable for most things.I'm very happy with this pressure cooker and am looking forward to my next challenge!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"While I don't use this product myself my girlfriend absolutely loves it. She was on a ""pressure cooker binge"" for a few months after she got it and everything we ate came out of it. It is still working strong but we have started to eat out more. The pulled pork and chicken she made in this thing came out amazing. She has cooked rice and used it in ""keep warm"" mode for the cheese for a party we had. This thing is pretty cool. You just set it and forget it. I could even use it if she didn't cook. It has a few musical sounds that indicate the status of the cooker, like when it is done and when it is set. I hear these sounds and get hungry haha. Overall this was a GREAT purchase and so much better than any stove top pressure cooker. It is fully automatic."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"We all have our preferences, but I absolutely LOVE my Instant Pot! I've owned dozens of electric and stove top pressure cookers over the past 3 decades and the Instant Pot outperforms them all. I guess I should thank my husband for destroying my old stovetop nonstick Kitchen Essentials--an expensive but well-made pot...but if anyone can burn a quality cooking vessel beyond redemption, he's the guy! LOL Fortunately, he stays away from my electronic kitchen gizmos.There are so many things to like about the Instant Pot that I can't name them all, but just to touch on a couple of them: The stainess steel inner pot is as easy to clean as it is attractive. The 2-hour time limit on pressure is perfect for things that would normally take much longer--like bone broth, for example. No need to worry about overfilling the pot, as in the old 2/3 full rule. At times I've filled my Instant Pot about 1 inch from the top and it's worked beautifully (tho I wouldn't recommend this as a rule or frequent practice!). Also, I detest the flavor, and usually the texture, of slow-cooked foods, but I've been able to make two dishes so far that are a-ma-zing and have no ""crock pot taste"" that was such a turnoff with other slow cookers. If there's one drawback, it's the way the silicone seal holds the odor of the last thing you cooked. Running it through the dishwasher didn't help. Soaking it in a vinegar solution was pointless. I'll get a replacement seal, and follow some of the ideas posted in the Q&A section there."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I can’t say enough about how much I love the Instant Pot!I haven’t purchased yogurt in the grocery store in about a year because I make my own that tastes leaps and bounds better than the store bought stuff. Sure, it’s a long process, but it’s mostly hands off!I can throw a frozen chicken breast in with some salsa and seasonings and in no time have fall apart tasty chicken for a few quesadillas, tacos, nachos...which is great for when I want something tasty but don’t want to labor over some recipe that will make enough food for an army!Mac and cheese in this thing is ridiculous! It takes MORE time to make the blue box stuff than in the IP...and the IP version is the creamiest and cheesiest ever! I take my whole pot and all the ingredients somewhat as a party trick when I take it as a dish and whip it up right there on the counter in no time flat and then keep the pot on warm to serve the cheesy goodness.It takes some time to learn about it...read the instructions, study the recipes before you execute them, join the Facebook group to watch what people are doing with this thing (both right and wrong so you can avoid making the same mistakes!) and don’t jump in and make something super intricate on your first go at making something in it, and you’re set!I’ve sold probably 10-20 of these to others after they’ve seen and/or eaten what’s been created by this magical machine :)"
3.0 out of 5 stars,"With all the hype of this multi use cooker, it’s okay with rice making but the flavor is no where close to a stove top cooking. Pressure cooking it is fine. Soup making is nice. Overall it’s a good piece of equipment for apartment life. House life? That is debatable. The biggest issue I have is the obscenely short power cable. If I’m pressure cooking I don’t want that steam to be shooting at my wood cabinets! For the creator of Instant Pot to be Chinese and as a fellow Chinese brother writing this review, this is a FAIL. Too bad it wasn’t designed with the three prong cables like desktop computers, smart TVs, so any cable can be upgraded depending kitchen location and counter space."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"Bought this for a sweet price as like new but with damaged packaging. It is actually a returned item and was missing the utensils. The metal trivet was loose and unwrapped in the pot so it scratched up the liner. Obviously that doesn't affect the function of use but was a cosmetic annoyance. The item works as it should and it was a sweet price, even without the utensils. If it had included those and not had the internal scratches I would have given it 5 stars. This is my 2nd IP, the 1st being a 6 qt. Bigger IS better! ;)"
1.0 out of 5 stars,"this instapot was barely used. i just tried to make a chicken soup & it was leaking steam around the lid while under the pressure cook mode. it has now completely stopped working & won't turn on or light up at all.  I have owned it for a little more than 3 months & it's completely defunct.  Should i get a replacement or reimbursement easily, I will update the review but not happy with it at all right now.  I have a partially cooked meal.I contacted customer service and after an extensive list of questions and documentation requirements they determined it needed to be replaced however don’t have this model in stock right now that was weeks ago I’m still waiting total rip off!"
1.0 out of 5 stars,"It was a Christmas Gift...came delivered to my front door with no wrapping. Wife answered the door, and guess what? Surprise...it wasn't Christmas Day, I had intended to wrap it. Used it about 4 times and it still smells like a new car. Couldn't really enjoy the food cooking because of the ""newness"" smell. I assume that's what it is? No recipe book, nothing, nada, just a 2 sided sheet of paper telling you cooking times for various items. Got the 8 qt. No real impressed."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is the best appliance I've bought in years. I've made everything from meatloaf to soups to yogurt to pasta to... well, you get the picture. Almost all of it has turned out great. There are tons of recipes online specifically for the Instant Pot, so there's no shortage of ideas and help out there. I've raved so much about the IP that several friends have ended up purchasing one-- and they've loved it, too.One thing I will note... While the IP does save a lot of time in the kitchen, it's not always in the way that you might imagine. Some dishes do still take an hour or more when you consider the time it takes to come up to pressure, the time it takes to cook at pressure, and the time it takes to release pressure (if using natural pressure release). The big deal to me is that much of this time is hands-off, so I can do other things. This is huge when I work all day and don't want to stand over the stove all evening. I find that I can do various household chores while the Instant Pot does its thing, which means that I can actually relax after dinner.I've owned the IP for about five months and use it several times per week. I have only used the saute, yogurt, rice, and manual pressure functions-- but those are really all that I'm interested in. It has not yet produced rice as good as my dedicated rice cooker, so I tend not to make rice in the IP. It excels at everything else, though!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I cannot say enough good things about this product.  I absolutely love it.  It is easy to use, easy to clean, instructions are clear and easy to understand.  I love that it does not heat up my kitchen when cooking.  I save the water left over from the cooking process and water my flowers with.  Depending on what I have cooked, I sometimes use the water as 'seasoning' in something else I am cooking.  One thing I have discovered, I almost always have to cook things longer than the recipes and time tables state.  But, that may be because I am a southerner and like my food cooked until it is ready to fall apart, which will make almost any chef cringe.  Note:  I cook for one, so this size pot is perfect.  But, if you cook for two or more people, go with the larger size (I have the 3 qt).  I am considering buying a larger pressure cooker for when I have company visit."
1.0 out of 5 stars,I read the reviews about these immediately breaking and not powering up after one or two uses and thought those people were just clueless.HAPPENED TO ME.Straight out the box - make hard boiled eggs and worked fine just to practice.Turned it on to make buffalo chicken dip and started then everything went black and DEAD.Outlet was fine.  BROKEN!THIS IS COMPLETE JUNK.August 2020 - clearly the year of disgust all the way around.DO NOT BUY
5.0 out of 5 stars,If you are expecting a baby or already have kids this is an amazing product. I have been experimenting a lot since getting this and it is amazing how quick you can make a meal. For instance. A pound and a half pork tenderloin took about 12 min to fully cook and came out juicy. Rice Cooks in less then 5 min. I even made beer infused brats in less then 10 min. We are so happy to have this with a baby on the way. It will make life so much easier.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"After contemplating whether I really needed yet another appliance or kitchen toy that would ultimately end up in the garage on a shelf I pulled the trigger on Black Friday and AM SO VERY GLAD I DID.  My InstantPot has not left my kitchen counter and I see no reason to move it far as it's used a couple times a week at least.  SO easy to operate and clean.  I bought the big one because I love left-overs and ability to make enough to freeze -- this more than covers that plan.  And it's SAFE.  I would have never purchased an old-time pressure cooker because they scared me.  AND PRESSURE COOKED FOOD IS BETTER -- hard boiled eggs, beans, soups, stews, yogurt, rice -- can't recommend this product enough!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"In my senior years, I've found a new way to cook.  I'm impressed with this wonderful cooking appliance.  Food not only cooks quickly, it cooks well, deliciously, tenderly and with less effort than the traditional methods of cooking.  Mind you, I love to cook, so I was apprehensive at first.  But, with age, it is a great helper.  I have baked, browned, made rice pudding, cooked 5 lb. pork roasts, stuffed peppers, etc. in this wonderful kitchen appliance.  I highly recommend the Instant Pot 8 qt. 7 in 1 pressure cooker.  We are only two, but I make enough to have left overs for several days and also to freeze a quart of whatever I make to have on a day that I am just too busy.  Or consider the hot, humid days of summer when you are not in the mood to cook.  Pull it out of the freezer...defrost, heat and eat.  I highly recommend the Instant Pot with 10 safety features."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"Its the best one I’ve used by a narrow margin. I like the stainless inner pot and most Parts dishwasher safe. I’m not convinced it cooks any better than other brands but I recommend it for the huge selection of accessories and recipes.  The seal ring picks up odors like others I’ve owned didn’t. Still, I recommend it to friends. I don’t get the cult following or the irrational fear some people have for these.Its a wonderful kitchen tool. It does beans, pot roast, soups and other things that would take hours relatively quickly. It makes perfect hard cooked eggs. It won’t do a good steak, replace 1127 kitchen appliances, or give you inner peace. Its main advantage over stove top pressure cookers is, it works unattended."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Once in a while, something comes along which actually works as well as it looks on the infomercials.  This seems to be one of those items.  I must admit that I have a weakness for kitchen gadgets and appliances.  So when I ordered this from Amazon, I figured it would be one more item that did not do very many things well, and I would rarely use it.  Being the eternal optimist, I figured it was worth a try.The Instant Pot arrived a couple of days ago and I have put it through it's paces since.  I am all abut improvising, but to be fair, I have followed the directions to a tee for this cooker. After seasoning the pot as suggested in the operations manual, I have done several dishes.  I ""baked"" a large potato, made chili, cooked a great pot of oatmeal and pressure steamed frozen Cod steaks. Everything came out perfect.  I'm very impressed.  Tonight I am fixing pot roast with carrots and potatoes.  It should take about an hour, and I can't wait.  If my next few weeks continue on as positively as this began, I am planning to get rid of my stove-top pressure cooker, vegetable steamer & Crock pot and begin using this as my main cooking appliance.The only negative thing I will say about the pot, is that I wish it were 8 quart rather than 6, but it works so well, seems crazy to pick it to pieces.I'm very happy with this purchase."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I had my doubts -- serious ones -- about buying this product. I've gotten by fine with my slow cooker, and wasn't sure about the value of a pressure cooker. Add to that a childhood experience of my mother blowing up the kitchen with a stovetop pressure cooker, and I was a pretty hesitant. The Instant Pot's sudden popularity among my friends convinced me to try it, half expecting I would return it unused.Well, I'm a pressure cooker convert. Following directions on timing is pretty critical.  I've tried making rice, soup, meat, and vegetables and almost all of it has been successful. The one failure was baby brussel sprouts. I didn't back off the recommended time for larger sprouts, so I ended up with little balls of mush. One thing to be aware of is that for relatively quick to fix things like rice, pressure cooking won't be faster because there's warm-up time, then the shorter cooking time, followed by the depressurizing period. All in all it takes about the same amount of time as stovetop cooking for things like vegetables and grains. However, tougher cuts of meat and legumes are much faster in a pressure cooker. The flavor is superior too. Even for the foods that don't enjoy a time savings, it's nice to just put it on and leave it to do its thing.I've also used the slow-cooker feature, sauteing meats in the pressure cooker pan before cooking them. I haven't tried canning or making yogurt, but I have a friend who uses her's for yogurt and loves it.  All in all, I'm glad I bought the Instant Pot."
5.0 out of 5 stars,I am a savy shopper and always looking for deals.......this thing is amazing I cook alot it replaces your pressure cooker.....rice cooker...crockpot.....and almost a skillet lol....less than an hour for amazing soups.....peferect boiled eggs.....mashed potatoes....rice....you name it.....i love how versatile it is and how quick it makes food....i have a busy schedule with 4 kids and sports all through the winter season so this makes it awesome and easy to cook throw everything in and hit start and u have an amazing meal no more hour for potatoes or 5hours for a good pot of soup.....i love this thing
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This was purchased as a replacement for one I simply wore out. The steam release on this model is amazingly better than that on the first model. I don't have to remember to ""seal"" the cooker before I turn it on; the release is quick and easy, and keeps my fingers away from the steam jet. An outstanding addition to an already outstanding product. Kudos to Amazon for a next-day delivery. The Instant Pot® is an absolutely essential in my kitchen. It makes hard-boiled eggs that peel without effort; cooks rice without sticking; and more."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Just throwing my 2 cents into the [instant] pot...  not like it really needs any more 5-star ratings, though.  this is a MUST have for apartment dwellers, and homeowners... a slow cooker, pressure pot, saucepan all in one ( you don't need to have the lid on to use it to saute stuff, so it is sort of a frying pan , as well!  We love being able to SAY NO TO CANNED BEANS FOREVER!  40 mins gives you great sodium-free (and more flavorful) beans.  Great for brown rice (rice/grains, in general, do need practice if you want to modify the rice:water ratio beyond the cookbook instructions.  easy cleanup (the lid and associated valves stay clear as long as you don't boil anything over by overfilling).  so, to clean, just pop off the lid and let is air dry.  scrub the SS  pot insert, dry and put it back together."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I had read good things about instant pots before, but it's even better than I had initially believed.  This thing is awesome! I now do 2-3 dinners a week in, mostly using the saute and pressure features.  I bought a couple of cookbooks and all of the recipes have been quite tasty.  This is not like a crockpot, where at the end you reveal that all meat tastes the same after being broken down in a slow heat.  No, instead, all meats retain their own delicious flavor.Also, my god... Indian food in this things is the absolute best.  I bought an Indian Instant Pot cookbook and every meal has been like dining in a restaurant.Clean up is also shockingly simple.  Nothing sticks to the pot and having to cook with a minimum amount of liquid for pressurization purposes means that nothing really ever burns to the bottom (or at all!)Amazing device.  Just add it to your cart now and begin the enlightenment. :)"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"yep—everyone else is right; this thing is amazing.  the day i got it, i had in on the counter reading directions etc, and then started to make my dinner and began to run cold water over a frozen tuna steak to thaw but figured i’d take a leap of faith and try it in this guy.  i seasoned the frozen slab of tuna, stuck it in and four minutes later it came out pink in the middle and if not as though seared on the outside, at least baked.  crazy!!—google it and make the crack chicken recipe for your family.—i have twin 11 yr old boys, so even tho we’re not a large family, i make food in large batches to freeze individual portions later and i’m glad i went with the 8 quart.  that said, if you’re tight on kitchen storage space, take note of the dimensions of this behemoth."
3.0 out of 5 stars,"My old crockpot went out and I was looking for a slow cooker when I happened upon this, it's not bad but the slow cooker option is aweful. Honestly thought about digging my old one out of the trash after using this option twice. The pressure cooker option is why most people buy it and that works fine, but this cannot replace a slow cooker. I had to buy another one of those 😕"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Pressure cookers have been around since the 17th century, so nothing new....except for better technology. If you've never used this type of appliance, you'll be amazed. Where a crockpot would take 8 hours to cook....this can do it in 45 minutes....with tender meat....more flavorful veggies....a noticeable difference! Meat still in the freezer? No worries....throw it in! Easy to use....to clean....and recipes galore for you to try out. Instant Pot seems to be a very well made appliance....Never any trouble with it. From time to time, you can pick these up for $50....so keep an eye out... Well worth it!"
2.0 out of 5 stars,"We are an older couple that use Pressure Cookers for most of our meals. I thought this would be a good replacement for our existing one. That didn't happen. The time settings changed minutes later as cooking was in process and had to unplug it. Tried it several times, and had to return it. There has to be something wrong within the electronics. How it got pass quality control, remains a mystery. Also, I haven't received credit on my credit card to date according to Amazons policy. Must be a bad day for me. Robt."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I LOVE this! I use it just about every single day.  I hardly use my stove anymore. I'm not kidding this baby is a game changer in the kitchen.  Once you learn to use it you'll always have it in your countertop.  It's useful for so many things.  Changed my life!  Really! Boiled eggs - shells just slip right off, dinner done in one pot in 25min!  I even made cheese cake and homemade yogurt!  Believe the hype... It's true.  Hands down the best thing I've ever bought on Amazon."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have a multiple pressure cooker (PC) household. Small one for beans/veggies.  Large one for meat dishes. I didn't think I needed this. I didn't believe the hype until my 92 year old friend insisted I reconsider the instant pot. #1 This cooker has overhauled my rice cooking experience. Worth the price as a rice maker alone. No more pressure cooker mess with making brown/multi-grain rice. No more sprays over the ceramic cook top. No mess period. The InstantPot has helped me keep my stove top cleaner overall.  #2 I'm eating more vegetables. Steamed vegetables are a breeze in minutes. I have had some rookie mishaps though. Unlike with regular pressure cookers, this requires sufficient water for any and all dishes! It will not generate water for you by cooking down the foods as you can expect with regular pressure cookers.It does not function exactly like your existing PC.  If you can accept that, you're good to go. I haven't tossed my old PCs. I find they cook dry beans down better. I may still be in learning curve for beans though."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm disabled and was having trouble cooking.  I've only used my stove one time since I bought the Instant Pot two months ago.  I can now quickly fix meals that I was previously unable to prepare.  I found it so useful that I bought a 6 qt for my son and his daughter and an 8 qt for my youngest granddaughter who is now pregnant with her fifth child (I figured she could use it ;-)!  If you've previously used a stove top pressure cooker, you will have no problem learning to use this cooker.  If you are totally new to pressure cookers, there is a slight learning curve.  Just remember that you MUST add water to cook in any pressure cooker, and please don't try to cook things like T-bone steaks that need to be cooked on a grill or any item that are best when cooked by other methods.  The manual and cookbook that comes with this cooker is difficult to follow so you may want to order a good basic Instant Pot or Pressure Cooker cookbook when you order your Instant Pot.  I purchasedThe Instant Pot® Electric Pressure Cooker by Laurel Randolph for my youngest granddaughter who is a beginner.  You will find many useful recipes, tips and instructions on Pinterest, YouTube and the Instant Pot Community on Facebook.  There are several bloggers, especially THIS OLD GAL, who post recipes and instructions about how to use the Instant Pot."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"If you're planning to use this for pressure cooking and crock pot cooking, don't throw out your old crock before trying it.  Mine doesn't work properly for this feature and another family member who bought the same exact item had the same problem.  It doesn't seem to cook it hot enough, so the food takes forever.  I even bought the glass lid thinking sometimes I'll go the crock route, but that turned out to be a waste of money, otherwise the insta pot features work well, so I'm giving 4 stars."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm giving this thing 5 stars based solely on the product being as described. Aside from that..I'M SCARED OF IT. This thing is intimidating, man. So much instruction.. endless possibilities, but no idea where to begin.It's definitely got potential. I'm excited about the prospect of cooking one of the 9 million IP recipes I have seen on the countless Facebook pages I have joined..I just need to stop being a little bi.. well, y'know.I did try cooking frozen chicken in it with my husband there for moral support. And it literally cooked 4 frozen breasts in about 16 minutes. Mind. Blown. Wish me luck on my future endeavors. I'm sure I'll put this thing through the wringer when I grow a set.."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I returned another pressure cooker for this one, and it was the right decision: this unit is better built and the stainless steel insert is a good idea. I thought rice would stick to it but it didn't. I made yogurt with whole milk, and will never buy yogurt again from the grocery store as the home-made tastes fresher and is significantly cheaper. I am impressed. Do buy another silicone ring (savory food smell will stick to it and you don't want the smell to transfer to your yogurt). I also bought the glass lid (nuwave 9"") that fits the Instant Pot perfectly (about the same price but nuwave's lid is nicer quality, imho).Update (3 weeks later): I made pork ribs, chicken and beef curry, rice, and yogurt in this pc. Everything came out really well cooked. I am sold on the yogurt function of this pc, I used mason jars (steam milk in them, no other pots needed), and we now enjoy yogurt every day! The beef curry is seriously addictive, and it only takes 35 min of stewing for tender texture (not mushy or tough). I do strongly recommend buying two more silicone rings, it is nice to not transfer smell from strong dishes (curry) to plain dishes (rice and yogurt). I also like the nuwave 9"" lid very much, it is very useful when you are reducing sauces after cooking food in the pc. I purchased another inner pot, as recommended by prior reviewer, now that I find myself using the pc every day. I honestly prefer to cook with the pc than the stove/oven. As pointed out by other reviewers, this unit is very quiet, except for beeps from the pc telling you dishes/cycle are done, there is no sound at all while it cooks your food.By the way, the white rice (basmati) takes 3 minutes to cook (plus another 10 min to cool down naturally). To boil the milk for the yogurt it takes 1 min (that's right, one minute). The chicken curry 13 minutes.Outstanding purchase. Kudos to the Instant Pot company for this wonderful product."
5.0 out of 5 stars,Had not used a pressure cooker in over 30 years.  Very different. Very little water evaporation.  Messed up my first dish with too much water but loved how quickly and silently it cooks
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I gave 5 stars on all areas w exception of cleaning. Need to clarify tho! The internal pot which conveniently comes out for storage in fridge, is simple to clean. The outside, same. It's the top w overlapping little lips that require a bit more time to squeeze a sponge or cloth corner along. These areas get collection from drips while serving several portions. Not a deal breaker at all! Just gotta remember to get under those things w a clean damp towel between (spills) servings, and All Good! It saves me MAJOR time and w the hectic schedules we have here, this thing has given us hours back to each day compared to previous options for preparing a meal after getting home from work and needing both family & ""me"" time!"
4.0 out of 5 stars,"Love this product. Since purchasing this item I am se my oven and air fryer less frequently. Where do I start?1. Literally does cook meals faster than conventional oven or air fryer.2. Versatile. You can prep almost every meals in this product. Steam, bake or cook meat.3. Time cook. Great feature for the out and about individual or family. I have the delayed time cook feature to have my meal ready exactly when I get home.4. I hate cleaning dishes. This product is easy to clean.Overall, only positives when it comes to this."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"We've had this for about 3 months now and we use it almost every day! I love how easy it is to make porridge or soups with the instant pot! I also really like how you can saute in the pot and so save on washing a separate pan. I typically use the ""Pressure"" or ""Saute"" functions, so I have yet to try the other ones. Also have yet to do any kind of roasting / steaming.Downside is the rubber ring that absorbs all kinds of food smells. Doesn't affect the taste of the food you're cooking though. And I know there are replacements you could buy if it bothers you."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"So far I love it.  The instructions are crap, so go straight to the internet where you can pick up lots of great advice.  My first meal was chicken and noodles and it turned out great.  My family loved it and is ready for more.Is it a huge time saver... maybe on some things.  I could have roasted some chicken breasts with vegetables, and made some noodles and gravy in the same amount of time, but I would have had a much bigger clean up and prep.  The dish was super yummy and easy, so that is a win in my book.  Don't be fooled by the cooking time.  Even if your cook time is only 5 minutes there is a good 15 minute time period in the beginning to build up pressure.  Just be prepared for that.I can't wait to try more recipes."
5.0 out of 5 stars,So happy I bought this instant pot. I was originally just trying to find a rice cooker and then some friends told me about instant pot and how you can use it for a lot of things including rice. I purchased it and I used it to cook some chicken with a recipe I found on Pinterest and it's amazing. I can't wait to use it for other recipes including rice!
5.0 out of 5 stars,Oh how I love my instant pots. Started out. Few years ago with a 6qt used that for 2 years and now upgraded to. 8qt. We do a lot of meal planning and now when I make Minestrone soup I have the right ration of broth to veggies. In the 6qt is always seemed not big enough. Love my pot use it’s 6 days a week sometimes. We travel with it in our rv in the summer. It’s a wonderful appliance. How is makes the flavors meld together and comes out perfect wink Moracann Lentil Lamb Chili. Omg. Perfect. Also have made egg bites and hard boiled. With ease. But where is shines it yogurt making. No more stock bought in this house.
4.0 out of 5 stars,"So, I will repeat what others have said.  The pot is non-stick which forces a person to use lots of fat for saute mode.  Not nice.  For me, this pot runs very hot and fast.  The good news is that food is cooked very quickly and you never have to peek under the lid, stir at the stove or turn on the fan.  It's quiet and fast.  The bad news is that veggies will cook so fast that they become mushy quickly.  One minute on the veggies is about right.  I've also discovered that rather than letting the steam shoot up all over the ceiling etc., it works well to release the valve slowly with the enclosed ladle and direct the steam with the bowl of the spoon!  This works well for me.  Instant Pot needs to manufacture  an optional non-stick pot that withstands the rigors of heat and pressure - I would buy it just for the saute convenience.  The Instant Pot is totally quiet when cooking, doesn't throw off heat into the kitchen and cooks soups and stews just great.  I'm looking for some really flavorful, low fat recipes for the cooker.  Got any?"

5.0 out of 5 stars,"My parents had a pressure cooker when I was a kid, happy to know pressure cookers advanced and an Instant Pot is what we have today. The one my parents had was scary! Huge, heavy, steam coming out of it with a lot of noise. Very happy with the Instant Pot. There's unique recipes on Pinterest (Instant Pot Manna, for one), bought a few cookbooks, and made Osso Bucco for dinner tonight in my Pot. The real Instant Pot was the best pot considered, I did the research, and it's easy to use. I bought all the utensils recommended also; wanted to be Girl Scout Ready if a recipe required anything. It's nice to get off work and put the ingredients in, and wait for the little beeper to go off while relaxing. This pot also cooks a meal with frozen meat, in case you forget to sit it out/put it in the fridge to thaw. I bought an Instant Pot to promote healthier eating, and it performs, and you can work any meal into pressure cooker times so any meal can be produced. It also rotisseries a chicken."

I throw itingredients for a stew, chili, goulash whatever into the pot **WITH  ENOUGH LIQUID** to do the job and I have a week's worth of food or at least 5 days, sometimes but comes out is too good and I munch on it every chance I get :-)(I've made steamed cakes/buns and flan too..I just don't move around enough to justify making these often)**if you are reheating, or cooking something that you want to be able to monitor.. use the timer and find a lid that fits (they sell a glass lid and also a silicone lid.. which is more for storage of prepared ingredients.. but if you're going to Mama through it you can use that.. also four things that might run out of moisture .. this is why things burn..the instant pot does have a burn notification but it's not always accurate.**"
1.0 out of 5 stars,"I have had two of these, both from Amazon. And I don't blame Amazon for my problems on this.The first one I used twice. On the second use, I had sauteed one chicken breast and when I was sauteing the other the machine just... stopped. Tried other outlets, tried letting it cool down, etc etc etc. It was dead in the water.Ok. Cool. Defective product. It happens.Had Amazon send me another, at no charge. I returned the first one. The second one only seals a portion of the time (less than 50%, easily), meaning that it will not build pressure.Absolutely a garbage product, and you get what you pay for. I would absolutely recommend a different brand because an ""instant pot"" is a very nice product, in theory."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"My daughter with a family of six wanted one so I gave it to her for a gift. She was happy.  She said, I have become a one dish wonder!! Next, my oldest daughter wanted to try her hand and decided that she needed one. Brought one for her and my husband in Tennessee. They loved it.  Although he loves to make stew, my oldest daughter started making it for him in the instant pot.Well, this 3rd one was for his birthday. He was spending his birthday in North Carolina with me (I am taking care of my elderly parents), so I decided to get him an instant pot for his gift. Well, when he opened his gift on his birthday, he was disappointed and complained. BUT, he tried it with the guidance of two girls, he made his first pot of stew in his instant pot. I must admit it was the best he had ever made. He is sold and loves his Instant Pot,We are an Instant Pot Family!!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Updated 08/30/17:  Still loving it!  Made pulled pork, cheesecake, beef roast, etc.  Everything has been delicious.  I still think it's easy to use and clean.  One tip - for almost every meat I've cooked, I use the natural release method.  I think it needs that extra time to finish cooking.  Some reasons why I like it so much and use it often:  It's simple; it's large enough to cook good-sized portions; it has plenty of options for cooking; can saute and brown meat right in the same pot; don't have to babysit it while it's cooking and depressurizing; and it doesn't heat up the whole house.  I'm really happy with this purchase.Original Review:  Received the Instant Pot (IP) Thursday.  Reviewed the instructions and found some keto IP recipes on Friday.  Purchased all the ingredients and cooked ribs on Saturday.  Cooked Corned Beef and Cabbage, Pork Roast with Mushroom Gravy, and a whole chicken on Sunday.  Everything was delicious, and the IP was easy to use (you MUST read the instructions!) and very easy to clean.  We're going to use the IP regularly because it saves so much time and everything turns out well.  Now I want to purchase an extra inner pot to speed up the process when I'm cooking multiple recipes.  I highly recommend this IP."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Instant Pot. I purchased these because a friend told me how wonderful it was and how fast meal preparation was. Being a busy on the go mom, I figured I would give it a shot. Well after purchasing I cooked in the pot about 3-4 times before it broke. Since it was still within the 30 days I was pleased that Amazon sent me out a replacement within 2 days. Guess you could say I got a dud the first round. Now that I have my second pot it is working well and I have had no issues with it. It is a quick way to prepare meats from frozen to done in about 30 min or less. The IP I have is a  7-in-1 Multi-Functional Cooker--Pressure Cooker, Slow Cooker, Rice Cooker, Saute/Browning, Yogurt Maker, Steamer & Warmer. Please refer the user manual before use. Must do a test before cooking in it for the very first time. If you have never used an pressure cooker it can be a bit overwhelming at first but after a few uses you get the hang of it. Include in your purchase is a 3-ply bottom stainless steel cooking pot, stainless steel steam rack with handle & manual and recipes in English, Spanish, Chinese and French and 2 spoons. I am still learning to use the IP and I am hoping I don't have any more issues like with the first IP purchased. I can say this, if the pot I am using now stops working I would not purchase another IP. I would want a refund of most of the money spent on it. I think paying as much as you do for something it should last for years to come."
1.0 out of 5 stars,"I have had my InstantPot for some time now and was a previous slow cooker user for years. The learning curve for using this was incredibly difficult for me. My biggest complaint though is that no matter how much I follow a recipe to the T as far as liquids go and what not, I get a burn notice if I am cooking with chicken breasts (which is most of the time). It’s incredibly frustrating that I can’t cook a “dump” recipe when trying to cook for my family and have the meal be on time because I can’t even get the darn thing to pressurize because of the burn notice. The only time I don’t get a burn notice is if I use the wire rack that came with, but how am I supposed to do that when I have others food items in there that I want the chicken to mix with and such? I hardly ever see a recipe that calls for me to even use the wire rack unless all I’m cooking is chicken breasts by themselves. I’m definitely looking for a different brand to switch to."
4.0 out of 5 stars,It’s a good pressure cooker great to have something extra to sauté and works nicely I wish I knew the temperatures for all of the buttons and it might be a little more intuitive.  You have to plan the time it takes for the food to get up to temperature and anytime that you may need for cool down onto your recipe when timing things.  I love it for yogurt.  Just be careful lifting the insert out when it’s very hot. The release valve could be more clearly marked
5.0 out of 5 stars,"One word - AMAZING!  We are so impressed with the Instant Pot 8qt.  My wife and I agree that the Instant Pot is absolutely one of the best kitchen gadgets/appliances we have purchased!  It is so quick and easy to use.  Love the fact that you can pretty much make your entire meal in one pot (sauté, brown, fry, etc.).  Add the ingredients and use the presets or manual controls.  Your food/meats will come out so tender, juicy and flavorful.  We have been telling everyone about the Instant Pot!  If you are debating on purchasing one - DO IT!  You will not regret it.  We have even been recommending the 5qt and 6qt Instant Pot to our single friends."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Forget to take those pork chops out of the freezer?  No worries - in 20-30 min you'll have dinner.Scared of making homemade yogurt - it's easy!No, nobody paid me or gave me any free products and when I heard people rave about this I kind of thought they were ridiculous but now I'm on the bandwagon.  You should't cook EVERYTHING in it (believe me, I tried) but there are a LOT of things you can cook in it.Do pay attention to the manual with the cooking times - I've found in general I don't need to cook things as long (learned that the hard way on a few chewy pork chops) - likely related to the thickness of my pieces.The most magical thing it does is turns rock hard dried beans into soup in less than a couple hours.  No soaking overnight.  Pretty awesome.  This has replaced our rice cooker and we no longer need to buy yogurt.We were a little afraid to use it at first but once you get rolling it's quiet a joy.  I did purchase the little grippy pot holder/grabber things which are a huge help (it's that or use an ove-glove) and one of these days I'll probably buy a spare pot.  I did not buy the lid but one of my skillet lids fits perfectly so I just use that when I need to cook without pressure or store it in the fridge."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"this is one of the best products i've purchased for our kitchen. saves times and food is very tasty! i've learned to use it and it can do many things in almost no time, lol takes more time to prep i think. and the food is delicious. it's easy to use, once you get the hang of it, i think you can excel! give it a try.t here are many free resources online for easy recipes too."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love my instant pot!  I've used it as both a pressure cooker and a slow cooker and could not be happier.  I will admit I did some research before buying so I was prepared for a few issues that some have had.  The biggest complaint was smelly seals.  I bought an extra set just in case, but I find washing them in the dishwasher seems to eliminate all funky smells.  So far I have made Asian meatballs, cheesecake, and ribs using the pressure cooker.  All came out fine, better than fine where the ribs were concerned.  My issue with the cheesecake I think was two-fold, I was rushed and I used the wrong recipe.  It was fine tasted great, but could have been better but that was my issues, not the pot.  Goes to show you that even when you're less than perfect, it still works well.I love the slow cooker, I made white chicken chili, set to cook the amount of time, when the time was up it kept it on warm until we were ready to eat  Love that aspect, no burned bottom or sides like my previous crockpot.I highly recommend to both novices as well as experienced cook, great as a time saver as well as producing great food."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Bought this primarily to cook beans. It is fast and consistant.  The size is perfect for my needs and it doesn't take up much counterspace. My only complaint is the silicone sealing ring absorbs smells and nothing will remove the odor. Not vinegar, bleach, baking soda, dishwasher, steam...have tried everything. Just go ahead and buy a second ring if you plan to cook a variety of foods. Also think about the size. My daughter has the 6 quart for her family of two and my son has the 8 quart  for a family of 6. We all use them regularly."
1.0 out of 5 stars,I'm based in Korea and had one delivered here. it was my buyer's risk to get a non-working item.  I contacted the customer support by email but I was told they can't help me because they're only servicing North American products. I'm now stuck with a non-working airfryer lid and I have no idea how to return.
1.0 out of 5 stars,"The one I purchased on Amazon worked one time! But I tried it out to late to send back! So I was stuck with a lemon! Lost my money on that one, So The next time I bought one It was from Wal Mart, Same brand ,All the works and more, It's the best instant pot in the world! It doe's everything!  The only draw back with this pot is , You need to buy the assessarys separately! The most important thing being, The Teflon extra pot to go inside! Because the inside pot that comes with it sticks and is hard to clean!"
1.0 out of 5 stars,"I have had this less than a year and only used it 10 times at most, but suddenly just stopped working in the middle of sauteing some meat. It won't even turn on. I have read the 1 star reviews and this seems to be a very common complaint. I have reached out to the manufacturer. They responded with a case number fairly quickly asking for information about what led up to malfunction and wanted pictures of the pot to show it wasn't obviously damaged (by me). I am waiting to hear back from them.I loved the cooker until it just stopped working. You may want to buy an extended warranty for this product. As far as the quality otherwise, the cooking pot is a good quality stainless steel pot, and cleans up well.  Not a lot of moisture escaping or dripping anywhere. It does a lot for one product. Had to give it a 1 star only because it completely stopped working. Hope they fix their quality issue."
1.0 out of 5 stars,"I contacted the company because the unit died after only two uses.  They don't stand behind their product.  They asked me if it was plugged in.  YES!  It was plugged in and not it is a paperweight - nothing turns on.  They suggested that the pot leaked and ruined the electronics.  That wasn't the case - but it is did, why would they make a pressure cooker that would leak?  Makes no sense.  Now It is garbage and I will buy someone elses product to replace this piece of junk.  -"
3.0 out of 5 stars,"This is a fantastic time saving counter top appliance. I use it at least two or three times a week to prepare steel cut oats, soft boiled eggs, and meat, following the suggested times. I could not ask for better outcomes so I am extremely satisfied with the Instant Pot -- with one exception. The sealing ring started giving me problems in less that six months from purchase. With leakage, it throws everything off. Very annoying to have to purchase a new sealing ring after only a few months. If you are going to an Instant Pot, I recommend that you order and extra sealing ring up from so you have it on hand when the initial one begins to fail."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"If you are on the fence about buying the Air Fryer Lid, you shouldn’t be! I ordered it because I really wanted an air fryer but am running out of space to put small appliances. When I received this I expected it to be a lot bigger but when I took it out, it’s pretty compact and easy to store in a cabinet. It works AMAZINGLY! I’m obsessed with using it as much as I can. It’s perfect for a one or two person household, especially if you want to save some space."
2.0 out of 5 stars,"This is the second Instant Pot I’ve purchased. Things I love are the sauté feature and versatility of the product. Things I don’t love are the lack of support when something goes wrong. My pressure valve fell out, clearly faulty. Now it no longer comes to pressure. I have emailed the support email from their website and never received a response. I still use it as a crock pot but can’t use it as a pressure cooker. I probably won’t purchase from them again because of the lack of response."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"Overall this is a great pressure cooker. It seems to perform very well. Easy to clean up, etc.I will purchase a smaller one for side dishes.My only complaint is the time needed to actually cook the meals (from Instant Pot's recipes) is considerably longer than stated.For instance - yesterday I made the curry chickpeas which was delicious - however, the total cook time was almost 2 hours.I started my beef roast at 5pm and its now 5:36 and still showing ""on"" hasn't begun to countdown the 45 min cook time.Very frustrating when you're trying to get dinner on the table at a decent hour.Moving from scaling to venting is very precarious - adding a longer handle for safer rotation would be helpful."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I finally did it and broke down and bought an instant pot. I searched around, and even with target having a sale and having 10% off coupon, amazon was still the best price. It’s easy to clean. Easy to use after you figure it out, and it is so versatile.  I can either use it has a pressure cooker or a slow cooker. I love it and wish I would have bought it sooner."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"I have a casori pressure cooker so am used to it. Now I have this one. The compare fairly well but I have to say instapot is more intuitive for me. So far it has cooked the meats better as well (they come out more tender without a doubt. The one problem I had was upon receiving the instapot in the mail, the plastic part that holds the drain cup on the side of the rim came bent and when I tried to secure the plastic cup it broke off the small plastic hook that holds it in ace on the instapot. It's such a small thing and only fixable if I return the entire pot who h would be ridiculous in my opinion.it still works, but that part in particular needs to be re-engineered in my option.  Apart from that, I'd have given this product 5 stars."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This air fryer lid is a perfect addition to my instant pot. It really does turn the instant pot into a pretty large capacity air fryer. It comes with its own basket which has a removable shelf so that it can hold a fairly large quantity. It does a very good job. Obviously the food on the higher level tend to cook a little quicker but considering everything it's pretty close. I have used it so many times since purchasing it that it has more than paid for itself already. It is a great way to make the potato wedges, fried broccoli, chicken, and fish. It is a very high quality item with easy to use buttons on top and seems like it is built to last."
5.0 out of 5 stars,this is a great pressure cooker !my advice is to get the eight quart !
3.0 out of 5 stars,I love the end result when it works.  In the beginning after 3 uses it worked flawlessly.  The third time not so.  The silicone seal prevented the cooker from starting up properly but luckily I had read some of the reviews and more than a couple people said to have some space seals on hand because it didn't last that long.  They were right.  I just used it yesterday with a NEW seal installed and it worked fine while making a pot roast but when it came time to add the raw potatoes after the roast was cooked it didn't want to start the 10 min cooking process.  I had to play with the lid to get it to work and start the cooking process.  The lid was on tight but now not sure if its another seal problem or is it the lid. Anyone have the same issues??
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is the first pressure cooker I've owned or even cooked with.  So maybe I'm missing something.  But at this point I don't even care.I have been using this to cook for me and my wife.  We usually cook enough to have leftovers since it's generally cheaper to purchase food items in bigger quantities.  This product has met all of my expectations and even exceeded them in some ways (it steams corn like a champ).  I've cooked beef roasts, pork loins, lamb shoulder, pastas (comes out overcooked), yogurt (LOVE IT), potatoes, and our favorite thing in this so far, whole chicken.  I have only used it as a pressure cooker (not slow cooker) since it makes quick work of most meals.  It's easy to use, easy enough to clean, and easy to adjust most recipes for it.  If this one every dies I will definitely be getting another.One downside I can see is for larger families.  Like I said, I am able to cook whole chickens in it (about 4-5 lbs).  But for those that have more than 4 mouths to feed I would take that into consideration.  Of course it all just depends on portion sizes...  Maybe you could just buy two?Another downside is that if you like things crispy (like chicken skin?) don't expect it to come out of a pressure cooker that way.  It would take a trip to the broiler or a skillet to get that crisp back.  But that's not a fault of this model, that's a fault of all pressure cookers.  So I wouldn't knock it any stars due to that."
3.0 out of 5 stars,"As an avid user of a conventional pressure cooker, I was hoping this would be a solution when I have extended stays in hotels.  Unfortunately, the 3 qt is just as large as my conventional pressure cooker (10 qt), and slower to pressurize.  I also noticed it takes approximately 30% longer to cook the same meals.  Sadly,  it DOES NOT come with a steaming basket for veggies (cheapest functional steam basket I found was $12) so add that into the price.  It is nice having the delay function, but if I knew then what I know now, I probably would have bought a hot plate instead."
3.0 out of 5 stars,"Don't let the hype fool you, this is just a well marketed electric pressure cooker!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I LOVE this thing! I am someone who enjoys cooking, and also loves cookware/gadgets. I have been wanting an instant pot for some time but was honestly a bit intimidated. I am so happy I finally took the plunge because after walking through the first use with the instruction manual in hand, this thing is a breeze! I can safely cook chicken from frozen in 20 minutes. Twenty minutes, people!! I have made so many different meals in my instant pot and each one comes out better than the next. Ribs come out falling off the bone, chicken is tender and perfectly cooked, chili tastes like it has been simmering on low for hours but it only took 15 minutes start to finish. It is so easy to clean, too, which is a major bonus. If you are at all interested in this product, take the plunge and buy it...it is so easy to use and so worth it!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"And I have them all! This has transformed how I cook. It stays on my cooktop 24/7 and I use it all the time. I mostly use the pressure cooker feature but how cool is it to have the equivalent of 7 appliances out and convenient!I have cooked mostly frozen meat in it and the results are always amazing. Quick, tender and delicious. Potatoes are a breeze.  I found a recipe for pressure cooker cheesy chicken, rice and broccoli casserole that takes 5-10 minutes to cook in the pressure cooker. I made pasta and sauce in it, putting the uncooked pasta in the sauce and letting the pressure cooker work. After 15 minutes, the pasta was tender - too tender, in fact. Should have quick-released the steam when the cooking time was up.There are other units that look like this one out there but I chose this one because the company is constantly improving the models based on customer suggestions. It also has a stainless steel cooking pot, which I insist on. No non-stick in this house, thank you. It is a dream to clean and nothing sticks in it when you are using the pressure cooker feature.There are websites out there devoted to pressure cooking. Check them out and be fearless! The old days of thoughts of exploding pots are over and I, for one, am thrilled. I have recommended it many times to friends and clients. All I can say is, What did I do before I had it?"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"My power pressure cooker XL stopped working, so since everyone I know has an instant pot and loves it, I bought this one while amazon had it on sale. The quality seems to be so much better than the power pressure cooker I had before. It also builds up pressure in half the time, which is awesome. I love the sauté option, which was not something the power pressure cooker had. It’s nice to be able to sauté in the pot without having to get another pan dirty and turn the stove on. My favorite thing about this pressure cooker is being able to cook frozen meat fast because I always forget to thaw meat out ahead of time. Frozen roasts come out super tender, more tender than I can even achieve in a slow cooker."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love love love!  Auto function is great!  Really fast, really good home cooked food!  Almost faster than drive thru!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This instant pot is seriously a life changer. I’ve used a regular pressure cooker for years but have had awful luck with the last two I’ve purchased, they were impossible to clean and nerve wracking to use. I kept hearing good things about instant pots so I figured it couldn’t hurt to try one out. Best decision I’ve made in a long time. It’s so easy to use, so easy to clean, I’m just upset I didn’t buy one sooner. I meal prep and this has literally cut the time I spend on that in half. Shredded chicken, beef, rice, veggies, it does everything. I’m so beyond happy with this instant pot!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"While I'm not a fanatic, I use this machine a lot. Stews, beans, soups and meats mostly.  There's more that I can cook with it, but I'm not one to go as far as trying to bake a cake in a pressure cooker.  Why do I love it - cut/chop, throw in the pot, saute first (in the pot) if necessary, set the button and then forget it until it's done.  Stainless steel instead of nonstick makes me feel safer.  I have a smaller rice cooker (also stainless steel) that runs next to it.  Wait - did I mention re-heating in the Instant Pot? The steam function (with a little added water) re-heats just as fast as my microwave but with way more flavor.  Great for the winter, but I'll be back on the grill come April."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love my instant pot!! I bought a 6 qt and then a year later also added an 8 at to my collection. 6 at is probably fine for single, couple or small families. I have a family of 4 and found that my 6 qt was sometimes just a tad small for me. Glad to have both."
5.0 out of 5 stars,We live off the grid—solely solar. You’d think an electric appliance would be too energy costly to be practical. We purchased another brand at Costco knowing it could be returned if impractical. Surprisingly it proved very practical and much easier to use than a stovetop cooker. With this experience we wanted a cooker with s stainless steel pot which our first cooker doesn’t  have. The Insta Pot was highly recommended. We are very pleased with its whole concept. It is much easier to program and clean. If you put your food in hot it comes to pressure very quickly and uses little energy to maintain the setting. My wife let me be the first to use it. I made the app recipe for beef chile—outstanding. And I even cleaned up the pot afterward—quick and easy.  Five stars was a given—an off the grid keeper.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I got one of these and came back to buy one for each of my adult kids. And they each love this as much as I do and use it every day. Oh My Gosh! Everything you make in this tastes better! And who can beat a wonderful from scratch chicken noodle soup in 8 minutes? Where has this been all my life? It's so wonderful to know we can eat a delicious meal with no fuss even if I did forget to defrost things and I'm exhausted after a full day of work. Yes, I have put every frozen food imaginable in it, and just added a few minutes cooking time. Turns out great. My husband loves rice and he cooks up perfect rice every time. So far, we've used it for just about every kind of food without a fail. Plus, it's safe! I know pressure cookers have gotten a bad rap over the years. But this one is different.I used a regular pressure cooker years ago but quit when my mom told me the story of her friend who had one blow up. The lady did survive, but I threw my old one out. The Instant Pot is different. It has 10 safety features to prevent a mishap. If the first one fails, the next kicks in, and so on. I don't believe it can blow up since these safety features immediately let the steam out to depressurize it. It really is safe because of all the backups.So, if you love the speed of a pressure cooker but were ever worried about them, this is your solution. It replaces many other appliances, too, I keep it out on the counter, and our countertop space is limited, but it's worth it. It's always ready to go. If you use it as often as we do, you'll love getting an extra pot liner, too! Very convenient to store smaller amounts of leftovers in the fridge while you make a larger dinner meal.If you are on the fence, go for it! You'll thank yourself!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I like to cook. This is by far the best kitchen device I have ever purchased. I have an 8 qt and a 6 qt on my center island counter. I've lost 30 lbs this year and I owe a lot of it to healthier eating using this device. I make batches of soups, stews, oatmeal, etc and freeze the extras. I make my own broths for soup fast and easy. It's a great rice cooker, slow cooker, but pressure is where it's at. My favorite recipes are making pot roast and french dip sandwiches with chuck roasts-- the meat is like butter. We buy Bob's Steel Cut Oats on Amazon and add apples, craisins, and bananas, for the best oatmeal ever. I didn't even like oatmeal before. Make real grits in minutes and hard boil a dozen eggs with fall off the egg shells. Hundreds if not thousand of recipes available online. Get one or even two!!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've used this wonderful invention just once and I'm a fan for life.  I've used pressure cookers for many years and have always loved the outcome. This is so far and above the stove top pressure cooker.  It is simple to use, easy to clean up and much safer than a stove top pressure cooker.  I just started it and walked away and dinner was simple, quick and delicious.  I'm so glad I bought this.  I know what I'll be getting my daughters and adult grandchildren for Christmas this year!"
1.0 out of 5 stars,"this is the second instapot i have bought thru amazon.  this one always flashes burn on the screen,  it heats unevenly.  i have contacted instapot support and the number of steps to go thru to get an answer from them in unbelievable.  I am unhappy with this appliance and unhappy with instapot support. I would prefer to return it."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I heard about this product from a friend who recommended it for yogurt making but also described all of the other functionalities associated with it.  I consider myself a good cook, and like trying new things but wasn’t entirely sure I needed another “slow cooker” to take up space in the kitchen.  I decided to purchase this back in April and have not regretted it for a minute.The Instant Pot is great!  Yogurt making is simple, but that was just the beginning.  I’ve been exploring all the various cooking options; yogurt, slow cooking, pressure cooking, rice, grains, stocks, and soups, with the sauté function being particularly convenient – one pot for everything.  This device does them all very well in one convenient appliance that stores well and cleans up easily.  I’ve also discovered that for many foods like soups, chili, pot roast, pulled pork, and stews, that are best when slow cooked, combining techniques of pressure cooking for quickness where it’s done and essentially ready to eat in about an hour or so if that’s what you want are even better when time permits to continue the cooking with the slow cooker function.  This gives them a better depth of flavor with as little as an additional hour, with even more when able to increase the time, all while having the luxury of it being ready to eat at any point along the way.  Another great thing is the ability to get your meals going and then walk away to let the Instant Pot work its magic.If you make one purchase for your kitchen I recommend the Instant Pot for consideration."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I was very skeptical of the ""instant pot"" but my wife wanted one for Christmas.  she's used at at least once or twice a week and I have to admit it works wonderful.  I thought it was a crock with electronics but the pressure cooker part is wonderful.  it makes ribs fall off the bone tender.  It is not instant as it takes time for pressure to build or not but it works like a dream.  Cleaning has been easy too.  I highly recommend it.  Follow up late April.  Got this for wife's Christmas present.  It has been heavily used and continues to be an excellent product.  It can't do everything but many things it is amazing.  :-)"
4.0 out of 5 stars,I have absolutely fallen in love with this product. It is a fast safe and easy way to cook healthy hearty meals. Easy to use.On the other side I do wish it had come with more baskets. The bottom of the metal pot did appear to lose its finish and I did not burn of machine wash.  Cant imagine my kitchen without it. I wish I pot the bigger pot.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is a quality appliance with a very nice cooking pot.  It's easy to use.  I am a traditional cook and I seldom use recipes so the set and forget feature is not to my benefit.  I like to stir and spice as I cook, adding flavors as I go.  You can't readily do that with this cooker.  However, my wife loves it and is always exploring something new.  She is in the kitchen a lot more now that we have this.  The stainless steel cooking pot is exceptional.  I wish it came with a snap-on silicone lid to enable refrigeration of the meal without transferring the food into another container.  I recommend!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love love love my air fryer. There are so many great recipes to use with it...coconut shrimp, apple fritters, salmon, beef jerky, fried zucchini, macaroni and cheese balls...the list goes on. It is a healthy way to prepare so many things that I would otherwise avoid since I try not to eat deep fried food. It is great in the summer since it doesn’t heat up my kitchen."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought this Black Friday 2017. At first, it seemed a little intimidating but is WAY easier to use than you can imagine! There are so many resources available on the internet to help you along with this wonderful item! This is, by FAR, the best thing ever created for the kitchen! We've used it, at least, twice a week, every week, since purchasing this. The variety of things you can make with it is astounding! Our 8-Quart is PERFECT for our family of 6. Since buying the 8-quart model, we've also gotten a 6-quart to be able to make different thing at the same time for dinner, breakfast, desserts... I cannot stress how amazing the Instant Pot really is! WORTH EVERY PENNY!!!!!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I had a Cuisinart Pressure Cooker that my husband purchased for me for Christmas 2 years ago.  The inner pot warped so that the cover didn't fit well anymore.  I looked into replacing the inner pot, but it was just as expensive as purchasing a new Instant Pot, so I went that route.  Let me just say, I can't believe how much more secure and safe the Instant Pot works!  My Cuisinart would always expel very hot steam until it reached the proper temperature and would ""seal,"" thus starting the pressure cooking process.  But I always had to be very careful until it sealed and the hot steam would cease.  There is NONE of that with the Instant Pot.  No safety concerns at all.  Never any hot steam escaping while it heats up.  I wish I had received one of these from the start."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Do you love TACOS? I do  so far 66% of the meals I have made in the instapot have been tacos!  Disclaimer I have made 3 meals. The other being red Thai chicken... also amazing.  However, back to tacos.Beans, you can make home cooked beans in 7-8 minutes! as you start cooking the meat, throw the soaked beans in and 8 min later you have cooked beans. What used to take 5 hours is now 8 mins.If you do not what to soak the beans, then just follow the instructions on the app for how to soak beans. It is something like 5 minutes.  Man, this has changed me.  I resisted, thinking it was a fad. NO this is not a FAD this is just good time management."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I regret.. not buying this much sooner! It's pretty much used every day or few. From soups to basically anything, you can cook in here. I use it a lot for dog food, just plop everything in and it's ready in a bit. It saves me so much time on so many things. It can be a lil weird to use at first but hang in there and keep on with it, ask questions online if you need to, it's so worth it. There are also tons of recipes you can find online. I highly recommend joining the facebook groups for ideas, recipes, and help."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I didn't realize at the time that my IP came with a loose plug in.  Once we realized it, we simply decided we couldn't live without this appliance and have never returned it.  The product works fine as long as we're not moving it around the countertop too much.This IP is used multiple times a week! As I write this it has a big home bone I'm cooking down into a bone broth.  I'll freeze the broth for the next time I want to make a soup.  We use it for hard boiled eggs (no boiling required!), Sous Vide egg bites (like Starbucks, but with added veggies and no dairy), soups, stews, spaghetti sauce... steaming veggies, making rice, etc.  It's used so often it has its own space on my countertop.For those nervous of the IP, don't be! Just be sure to not let kids use open it, as the steam can come rolling out.  If you slowly rotate and open the lid, then open it away from you, there won't be any problems.  I've certainly never had any!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Who needs a Crock Pot / Slow Cooker anymore?I grew up in the 60's and 70's when pressure cookers were placed on the stove and seemed like a dangerous thing. I can remember once that my Dad released the lid too soon and the contents blew out on the wall behind the stove top. So using a pressure cooker never entered my mind.I saw a recipe specific to a electronic pressure cooker recently and took a fresh look. I decided to buy one because it had a built-in de-pressure and release functionality so I figured I could try using it without a blowout.The Instant Pot is an electric pressure cooker with preset and programmable settings. You can use the presets like Beef/Stew, Chicken, Rice, Beans, etc... to determine cooking length or set a time duration and pressure setting (low/medium/high). This flexibility allows you to leverage numerous recipes that you find on the internet. I've even started adapting slow cooker recipes to the Instant Pot because I can make a meal in 25 minutes that would cook in the slow cooker for 7 hours.Here's some of the interesting features that make this a far superior option to a slow cooker:Saute - You can brown meats or saute things like onions in the stainless steel pot prior to doing the pressure cooker cooking. For slow cookers, you need to do this in a separate skillet or saute pan and then add it to the slow cooker bowl. Another pan to wash...Last night I made a shrimp and rice dish - The shrimp was added frozen to the SS pot and It only needed 5 minutes to cook. I didn't have to plan ahead and take the shrimp out before I went to work. P.S. You can cook rice in the pressure cooker.You can make flan and yogurt in the pressure cooker. There's a rack that can be placed at the bottom of the pot, put in some water, close the lid and voila.You can steam lobsters, mussels and clams in minutes. One of the recipes I found online was a country clam boil...bingo!Oh, and regarding my initial blowout fears...I'm now so comfortable with using the Instant Pot that I release the pressure at the end of the cooking cycle. It's a small latch that twists. When the metal piece that seals in the pressure drops in a few seconds, you know that all of the internal pressure is gone....Very easy.I put my crockpot away. I can't imagine that I'll be using it again."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This seems like a very nice cooker, it looks like it is very high quality, and it sounds like everyone who buys one is extremely happy with it. I have not used mine yet and I've had the poor thing sitting here for about a year now. For many years I have been afraid of pressure cookers after a very terrifying experience as a child when my Grandma had one explode on us while we were in the kitchen! I thought that if I bought this one, it would help me to get over my fear because this cooker works a bit differently. But, after it arrived and I read through the instructions, it sounds too complicated and scary for me to try it. I have been trying to get my nerve up to at least give it a try as I got it mostly to cook beans in. But it sounds like beans and pasta are not the best things to use in this cooker. If I can only get it packaged back in it's box, I will ""gift"" it to someone at my church  who is not afraid to use these things."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"Update: I still love this little machine. Hard boiled eggs in 3 minutes! Yogurt in 8-10 hours! I still don’t like not being able to clean under the seal but if you do baking soda then vinegar and scrub it well, it helps the smell of the seal....  the seal does not come of on mine.This little machine is great but the seal is hard to clean and smells bad. The lid seems to smell like whatever you cooked and I got to find a way to remove the seal and clean it better. Guess I better get the instructions out again. Otherwise it’s the best thing I ever purchased."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"Having a newborn, the instant pot was recommended to me, and so far I have used it only once! What a game changer. I bought mine on the 9th (Jan) and used it on the 18th. When I finished cleaning it, and ready to make my next meal, I noticed that the rim of the inner pot is rusting! How could it be? The material used to make the inner pot looks high quality but I guess not! 4 stars for the duo nova for that..."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love this instant pot. we borrowed our daughters larger instant pot and was very surprised how the food prepared in it was moister and crisper, just over all tastier. Since there are only two of us, we decided to get the smaller version and love it. We have been able to get rid of our crock pot and rice cooker. Very happy indeed."
2.0 out of 5 stars,"It's like my dad used to say: ""son, there are no shortcuts in life"".I think to find this product useful, one must really like crockpot cooking. I bought this to save time, without sacrificing flavor. But once you factor in the 10 min it takes to pressurize, and another 10 it takes to depressurize, any time savings are negligible. That might be enough for some people, but for me, once you consider that a product designed to essentially steam food (in batches) isn't going to produce varied flavor profiles and textures (the saute feature too weak to really brown anything) I can't justify the counter space.  All the recipes I've tried were on the bland side, and I like to tweak as I cook (thicken, flavor,...), which you obviously can't do with it. That, and it does not noticibaly save on cleanup. (I.e. two smaller pots vs one larger one.)I will donate it to my local goodwill with the hope that someone will enjoy it. Too bad. I had high hopes."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"My wife is Mexican and uses one of these often, for us and members of her family. She has been borrowing her sister's but wanted her own. She is used to a six Qt but she likes this smaller one (three qt). It has been big enough for almost everything she has used it for, and when it wasn't she just did two batches. She likes the small size, says it is fast, and finds the controls simple to use (important). We are happier than we hoped for with this."
3.0 out of 5 stars,I sent this back. I love instant pot and have 3 of them. I thought this would be perfect but it’s big and bulky and very little room for actual food. I ended up never using it and sending it back and ordered a stand alone air fryer.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"We've used it almost every day since it arrived and it's been so helpful in making meals for our busy family. The only thing I was disappointed with was that the instructions are not very thorough. I've had to Google and figure a lot on my own, including all of the accessories that came with it. The recipe booklet was nice but the ""cheat sheet"" doesn't help unless you know how much water to put in, so I had to Google that as well (lol). Overall, however, it is a great machine. I wish it came in more colors; the Pioneer Woman brand is pretty but smaller and not as good a deal. I ended up buying a magnetic wrap on Etsy for $12 to make it look nicer and match the decor of our skoolie. :-)"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I was actually searching for an electric pressure cooker, then came accross the multi cookers and decided it was a much better bet. After much comparisons with features and reviews I purchased my first electric multi-use cooker.  This appliance is just fantastic - and really replaces a rice cooker, pressure cooker, slow cooker and more in this all in one.  One my first use, cooking a pork roast, there was absolutely no noice from it and I thought maybe it wasn’t working.  So I went online and researched, and found out the insta pot doesn’t make any noice.  Quite a relief from those noisy hissing stove top pressure cookers.  My pork was done perfectly in about 30 mins- just set it and that was it.  I love the keep warm feature.  One thing is that this is really a big pressure cooker for just 3 persons.  I am seriously thinking of getting a smaller one - a 3 quart for every day use, since I will only be cooking large portions occasionally."
1.0 out of 5 stars,"No matter what I do, I'm constantly getting a ""burn"" message which brings me to taking out the food and figuring out how to salvage it, usually on the cooktop instead. What a mess."
3.0 out of 5 stars,"This was a really nice product at first, but then my recipes started coming out half cooked.  I finally realized it was because the seal wasn't sticking.  Last week I figured out that if I put a 5 pound weight on top of the lid, balanced precariously, it would pressurize and cook properly.  This doesn't seem like an ideal solution.  The seal seems fine, but  the clamp from turning it to cook doesn't seem to place enough pressure on it.  And apparently it's too late to return.  I guess I should use it more to see what breaks before Amazon lets me return the inferior product for replacement."

   I've only made one meal in my Instant Pot so far,  but it was a great experience.  I was able to saute veggies/sear meat for my roast,  pressure cook the roast (in less than an hour!), and make gravy afterwards,  all in one pot. I usually just throw everything raw into the crock pot and skip the gravy because it's too much cleanup. But this was perfect.  I'm still learning,  but it seems to be a very valuable kitchen addition. I love that something that used to take all day,  can now be done from start to finish in under 2 hours with the same or better results.  Reading the  instruction manual helped me get more comfortable with the device.  I'm still a little intimidated by the quick release of the pressure cooker,  but I was able to maintain a safe distance when releasing by using a kitchen spoon.  I plan to update this review after more uses."
1.0 out of 5 stars,"This thing flat out does not work. Tried to use it for the first time last night to slow cook some pulled pork. It should’ve been on, but never made any heat. I read the instructions 19 times, kept trying and trying, nothing. Left it on overnight. Woke up to a stone cold pork shoulder.Can I still return this thing? If not, this is the first time I’ve ever been scammed by amazon. I got tricked into buying this for that “amazon day” promotion. What a piece of S."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Updated 10/11/16 -- While I had given this 5 starts on the original review, I wanted to add these few comments as well.  If someone had asked me my favorite kitchen appliance a few months ago, I'd been hard pressed to choose between the food processor and my KitchenAid mixer.  Ask me now and without hesitation I would say the Instant Pot!  This thing is amazing and I use it almost every day!  I have used every option on it with the exception for the slow cook feature.  When I bought it, I saw that it had a yogurt setting but figured I'd never use that.  Just on a whim I tried it a few days ago ... OMG!  the yogurt from this thing is amazing.  I even bought the 

  
Euro Cuisine GY50 Greek Yogurt Maker









  
  
    
   to strain the yogurt once it's completed.  It tastes nothing like the store bought stuff ... no grit or that 'off taste' that I'd become accustomed to from the store bought yogurt.  Every kitchen should have one of these pots.Add me to the list of fans of the Instant Pot.  I have a stove top pressure cooker but really don't use it that much due to the footprint ... My stove has the large burner in the back and the PC interferes with the controls and is too large for the burner.  Regardless, after using the Instant Pot for about a week I have no doubt I'll be using it a lot.  I've been happy with everything I've cooked in it so far ... I find it easy to use and would encourage any new users to just jump in.  Look for a recipe designed for the Instant Pot and go for it.  I've already ventured into converting some recipes and have been successful for the most part.  It's mind boggling to think that the foods can cook so quickly, but they do and they taste great.There are a lot of resources on the internet for not only pressure cookers in general, but some specific to the Instant Pot due to its popularity.  I just wish I had discovered the Instant Pot a long time ago."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"While this hasn’t changed my life in the kitchen, it’s super versatile and easy to use. I’ve made yellow curry chicken, split pea soup, broccoli soup, chowder, shredded beef enchiladas, and a couple roasts so far. Love the ease of switching from sauté to pressure or slow cooker settings. Overall, it’s a pretty useful gadget!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"We are giving the Instant Pot Duo 60 five stars as of this date. We ordered it in mid-December (shipped & received very quickly, as usual) while on vacation in California.  When we returned home we unpacked it and put it to the test. So far everything we've tried has been excellent. We are partial to brown rice and this pressure cooker has delivered a perfect batch twice, so far. 22 minutes at pressure, short cool down and voila! Perfectly done. Boneless chicken thighs in a savory sauce in 15 minutes plus about 10 minutes cool down. Fork tender. Yummy. Clean up is easy and the stainless steel pot remains in spotless new condition. That was an important factor in buying this highly praised cooker. We did not want a non-stick coating on the cook surface and it definitely does not need it, at least in our experience to date.If you are considering an electric pressure cooker this one deserves a hard look. We love it.One last note.. If you're accustomed to the steaming, hissing stove top cooker this thing may cause you to think it's not working. It is eerily quiet in operation. Keep the faith, you will be pleasantly surprised."
1.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought this unit last year and used it  only about ten times because I really did not feel safe using it . I finally decided to try using it again  recently only to find out it does not even  turn on anymore!  I tried to contact Instant Pot  Support and sent an email last week ...never heard back from them. This morning, I called the 800 number, waited a very long time to get someone live to talk to me and all I kept getting was recorded message that there's many others  waiting in line too  (for the same problems???) so  please keep waiting!Needless to say, VERY UNHAPPY!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have very little kitchen or stove-top cooking skills.  What I do have is a palate that naturally knows what spices and amount of spices blend together.  As a result the Instant Pot is my perfect cooking companion.  I love all kinds of international cuisine so after after assembling some basic Indian and Thai spices I was off on my Instant Pot adventure, again thanks to help from YouTube.  Those that sampled my first attempts at Indian and Thai dishes were amazed and remarked the results were restaurant quality.  What I'll add here is actually I think the results are better than restaurant quality because I have direct control over things like sodium content and the freshness/quality of my ingredients.  I love the Instant Pot- it has given me a whole new outlook on spending time in the kitchen!"
1.0 out of 5 stars,"I’m in the camp that a pressure cooker isn’t that much faster for me.  By the time I prep, pressurize, and  depressurize, imcould have made my dish using conventional methods.  I tried beef stroganoff and it turned out fine but the recipe covered and 8 1/2 x 11 inch page in tiny font with multiple steps.  In my crockpot, there are two steps and I’m done. I sold mine to a neighbor."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I simply LOVE this pressure cooker.  It is silent, the stainless steel interior is very easy to clean, and it cooks well and fast.  The other day I put some dry macaroni noodles, a can of cream of chicken soup, some cheese, and two completely frozen chicken breasts inside.  Everything cooked to perfection in 15 minutes.  I've also used it as a slow cooker which is wonderful as well.  I would definitely buy again.  I find myself using this 2-4 times a week in stead of my oven or slow cooker and couldn't be happier especially since it is quiet and much safer than an oven top model.  For anyone who might be concerned about using quick-cool pressure cooking recipes, you can easily flip the steam release valve and it will completely depressurize in 1-2 minutes.  This means you can still get your vegetables out while they are still crunchy and not wait 20 minutes for the pressure to wain.As an aside, I will add that this seems to be rather durable.  I had mine delivered to work and it came while I was away at lunch.  A coworker decided to move the box.  While doing so, she tripped on something in the office and practically threw the box as she fell (we have video).  Since the Instant Pot was double boxed and well packaged with foam inside, it fair just fine without a single scratch and still functions flawlessly."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have had the instant pot for a few weeks but just opened it last night. I did the test run as recommended by the instruction manual as I had never used a pressure cooker before and then I made a 5 pound chicken. I was skeptical how it would turn out but it was fall off the bone tender and had great flavor. I set the timer and had steel cut oatmeal waiting for me when I woke up this morning and tonight my son and I made pulled pork in 75 minutes that shredded easier than any pulled pork I have made in the smoker (granted while this pulled pork was very tender the taste is nowhere as good as the smoked pulled pork IMO so I would only make it in this manner if I was in a hurry ... but I can't imagine a scenario where I needed to make pulled pork quickly). I bought this one specifically for the yogurt function (and dishwasher safe stainless steel parts) and will be trying that tonight.UPDATE: In the last few days I have made homemade mac and cheese (from dry noodles to ready to eat in 20 minutes), yogurt, chicken stock (2 hours instead of a full day on the stove), homemade dog food (took 30 minutes when it used to take hours), beef stew and chicken noodle soup. I admit I am finding a lot of reasons to use if just so I can test it and will not use with this frequency in the future but it is awesome and will get plenty of use in my kitchen."
3.0 out of 5 stars,"I really did like this instapot! It was small, light and could do what I needed it to do .....up until a day ago. I purchased this unit in August of 2019 and now, here in May, it's died a painful death. I followed all the reset instructions, checked the cords, etc. Nothing - no power is coming to my unit. It's disappointing at best.Left messages with customer service regarding warranty, etc. No response. I'm sorry to say that now I'm considering purchasing a different pressure cooker because customer service was subpar.The machine works great when it does - if customer service was better I would purchase again in a heartbeat."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love that this product speeds up my cooking times and keeps meat really moist.  It's been very easy to use and there are many, many recipes with specific instructions for the Instant Pot.  The only drawback with the 8-quart is that most recipes are made for the 6-quart model so either you have to make a larger quantity than I sometimes want or you have to use more fluids as there is a minimum quantity of liquid required for the pressure cooker."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Oh my! Why did I wait. I’m a bit of a minimalist and didn’t want an extra appliance, but I use it so much, I keep it on the counter. I do find the inside lid a bit challenging to wash. I made youghurt once, and have been worried to make it again because I’m not 100% confident the kids is sanitary. Still, I use it for bone broth, browning before soups, stews, beans, and love that I can quickly cook a chicken or rabbit to pull for dishes. I’ve also used the slow cooker fir overnight porridge. It doesn’t burn like my old slow cooker did. Oh, and if it detects something is burning, it lets me know with a beep and a message. Very cool. I’m in love. I’ve downsized my annoying pot cabinet. No more clanging pots and lids. Just a sauce pan, egg pan, a soup pot, and wok. My cast iron is on the stove."

Hubby got me the air fryer lid accessory as a gift and now my Instant Pot is an air fryer too! It's opened up a whole new world for us as far as easy, great-tasting meal options. Highly recommend."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I had never wanted a pressure cooker until I saw this one. I LOVE all it can do and the safety features that are built in to make it fool-proof. I can pressure cook perfectly or slow cook if I want. One of my favorite things is that it is TRULY an all-in-one pot. I get frustrated with crockpot recipes that require searing meat in another pan or cooking meats through in another pan prior to putting them in the crockpot. Who wants any more dishes to wash? With this, I can sear the meat first, then incorporate the meat and vegetables and liquid and let it do the rest all in one container. No oil splattering out of the skillet if the meat flops over while trying to sear it because the sides are high enough to prevent both the splattering or the flopping over. It cooks good sized pieces of roast. I even made mashed potatoes with no extra liquid to be poured out in a little over 10 minutes once the cut pieces were in the pot - 20 minutes tops. It usually takes 20 minutes for the potatoes in a stock pot once the water comes to a boil, then add the ingredients. No strainer required. One less dish to wash and the stovetop was free for preparing other items. I highly recommend this to any family needing a new crockpot and for newlyweds."
1.0 out of 5 stars,"I love my Instant Pots. I love all my pressure cookers. I have six not counting my pressure canner. I have three Instant Pots. Yesterday I started dinner in the mini and it just shut itself off. I can not get it started again. It is just died. I thought they were made better than this. Did not even made a year. I wondered how long the other ones will last. My other pressure cookers (Cuisinart, Power Pressure XL and a EZ Bean Cooker) have lasted years. My pressure canner is over twenty years old. How disappointing that the Instant Pot does not work as well as the other brands. NO more Instant Pots for me.  No more recommending Instant Pots for me. There are too many choices of good pressure cookers to settle for such poor quality.  Only lasted 8 months."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is our 2nd Instant Pot. We really liked our 6qt Duo and decided to get the larger 8qt. It does not have the fancy auto sealing lid like the newer models or the additional functions, but the Black Friday price was a steal, so we went for it! We only use the pressure cook function anyway. If you don't need the extra features like us, save your money and buy the Duo! :)"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I got this on Black Friday. I was VERY intimidated by it at first, and managed to screw up the first chunk of meat I tried to cook. But, I tried to cook a HUGE hunk of pork, from frozen, so it was completely my fault. Hard boiled eggs are ridiculously easy, and soups are quick to make. If you're cooking large pieces of meat (pulled pork, etc), do yourself a favor and thaw it, and then cut it into chunks first. It helps a LOT!I haven't used this as a slow cooker yet, so can't speak to how it works for that...but LOVE the pressure cooker part!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"OK, I am reviewing this pot as the husband of a wife that uses it! I LOVE THIS POT! My wife makes all kinds of meals in it. But I really like the meat when she does it in this pot. It comes out so tender, fall off the bone type tender! Everything she has cooked in it comes out tasting better and is more tender than other ways. Plus I like that she can set it in the morning, and it cooks during the day and dinner is ready for her (and my son and I! ) in the evening. She is a fantastic cook and this pot just made her cooking even better if that was possible!She (we) liked it so much that we bought another one for her mother to have. And she loves it also.Since I am the one that does the dishes when she cooks, I like that it cleans really easy. The stainless pot inside that is removable is easy to clean. I have even watched her sear meat in the pot before cooking it slow style int he same pot she seared it in! I don't know if that is good or bad but it was pretty cool to see that she could do that!If you are looking for a pressure cooker, slow cooker and otherwise a great programmable pot to set in the morning and have done for dinner, I love this one! And that is the review of one that eats what comes out of it!!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased this in November 2014 and at the time of this review have had it for 3 months and used it approximately 20 times.This is a brilliant machine! When my slow cooker died a few months ago, I started the process of finding what I should replace it with. I'd heard of the Instant Pot on a blog and was intrigued by it enough to research some more. I had never used a pressure cooker and was concerned if I purchased the Instant Pot, I wouldn't use it for this. With such an expensive price tag it took me several weeks to decide to just go for it.The functions I use the most are:-pressure-slow cook-sautéI love that I can save time and dishes by sautéing in the Instant Pot before pressure cooking or slow cooking. There are 3 adjustable heat settings for this function. The Instant Pot has so many variable settings, I can run it for as little or long as I want. It will automatically switch to he warm function when it is done. This was important to me since my old slow cooker did this which saved many dinners.I've tried the pressure cooking portion of the Instant Pot several times now. At first I was terrified I would explode it. It's obviously not going to happen. There is a pressure release valve making it extremely safe in this mode. I've found that if I wanted to slow cook something and forgot to put it in, I can pressure cook it for a fraction of the time. It's been very experimental with this since the instruction books are very confusing on what to do with converting a slow cook recipe to pressure cook.I've now been making bone broth several times a week on the pressure cook setting for 50 minutes with natural release. It's much more flavorful and is done in less than 1.5 hours compared to slow simmering for 8-10 hours. I've also made perfect hard boiled eggs, beef stew, braised beef and many other recipes. I'm a huge fan!A couple downsides that I've found so far is that the shape of the pot is hard to put some roasts in it. The shape of the meat needs to be the opposite of the shape needed for a traditional slow cooker. The pot although dishwasher safe, does not come clean in the dishwasher. I've tried it many times and it's best to hand wash it. For broth and soups, the pressure cooker should never be filled more than 2/3 full. This means that the yield is much less than a traditional slow cooker or pot on the stove."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought the Westinghouse or some other fancy brand. It worked for one month before shutting off in warm mode. The Instant Pot AWESOME. The smallest issue like the chime that goes off or on if you do not get the lid on correctly. Brillant. People this is a Pressure cooker every bit of pressure is needed. If the lid is not on right . kaboom. There are some amazing settings that I have only seen on the Instant Pot like pre setting the Instant Pot to cook later. Though I have not tried it Yogurt? So cool. The pot it comes with could clean a bit better. Very easy to setup. The valve to choose release or keep pressure could have a brighter indicator still better than any other brand I have seen. I have just got into pressure cooking still learning the ropes. It seems a lot of my food is coming out boiled that is me, not Instant Pot. There is a metal device allows you to put Chicken in then lift it out. Sorry, I do not' know what's that is called. Needed if you put the chicken in directly it can burn the bottom. Though a baby carrot popped out in the lip of the instant pot. I kept hearing that chime tried to close it over and over. A tiny piece cracked I hope it will not get worse. However, that is again my bad."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I wanted a 10 quart, but decided to go 8 quart as it was just hubby and I.  The reason was because frozen leg quarters wouldn't fit in a smaller cooker.  It's the perfect size for me to make the beef (8 lbs.) and broth for my 'toddler bath size' blue speckleware pot.  So many ways to cook things as YOU see fit.  The only, and I mean only downside-and this applies to all electric pressure cookers I have seen, is that channel that runs around the top of the cooker, just under the lid.  Perfect for catching drips etc.  NOT easy to clean!  Hate that part.  But it's a tiny piece of the overall love I have for this product.  I highly recommend it anyway."
5.0 out of 5 stars,I bought this as I have a smaller one pot and couldn't make a lot of things in it.  I used it for the first time yesterday and made a cheesecake recipe on You Tube and it worked well.  Only thing I found a problem was misreading where the plastic part on the outside goes(da) .  Thought it clipped on to a part but wasn't the case.  I also bought some colored gaskets for it as I read if that some smells cling to the gasket and I like to make sweet things like cheesecake sometimes.  I plan to use it a lot during the summer especially so I don't heat up my oven.  And also be sure to plug it into the pot before as plug is separate.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Omg I love my IP! I'm still getting into learning how to use it but it's so doable. I've never cooked with e a pressure cooker before owning this, and the books that it came with and instructions were cool too, little recipe book and easy instructions. The only thing I will say though, I use pinterest a lot and tons of the recipes on there are incorrect on cooling times for things, usually too short. Once you get this and use it you will see the value in owning one guaranteed. Since I now have the IP and a air fryer, I have NOT used the stove top for literally anything, as well as baking either!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"One look at the Instant Pot and I wondered why nobody else had thought of it first.The Instant Pot combines the features of a slow cooker and a pressure cooker but can saute very well too.  I've always loved my pressure cooker -- grandma's microwave -- but the Instant Pot can be programmed for delayed start and for cooking time, which no standard pressure cooker can do.Cooking with it takes a bit of getting used to, but not much, and it's worth the effort.  My 2 cents: the cook time that displays when you start the unit does *not* include time getting the contents up to pressure.  The food does cook, however, while the pressure develops.  I scorched a couple of dishes by not taking heatup time into account.But I can hurl frozen meatballs into the pot, add a jar of marinara and extra seasonings, set the timer for 5 minutes (of pressure) and in about 15 minutes, the meatballs are cooked thoroughly, the sauce is hot and the seasonings are fully incorporated.Definitely a smart purchase."
5.0 out of 5 stars,Good addition to the instant pot for frying or broiler function. Save having an additional dedicated air fryer or doing traditional frying with oils on the stovetop. Makes it easy just place the food in the included fry basket or dehydrater plate and lock the air fryer lid in place. Control panel on top indicates temperatures and times.
2.0 out of 5 stars,"Stopped sealing well a few months after owning it. Now 18 months later and several new seals which don’t change anything, it’s done. I thought this would last. Nope."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Amazing addition to my kitchen. I first saw the Instant Pot at a church pot luck dinner and started looking into its usefulness. Since buying this product, I've prepared Pot Roast (Slow Cooker), Rice (a built in feature, Chicken and Dumplings (Pressure), and BBQ Pulled Pork (Pressure).  Each of these were easy to do and delicious...the Pulled Pork was restaurant good in less than 2 hours for prep and cooking.  There are hundreds of recipes available online!  The DUO Plus were easy to learn. I plan to use the DUO Plus often.  (I've bought the smaller 3 qt DUO as a companion piece to the 6qt....tomorrow I am trying Marinated Steak in the 6 qt while preparing a side dish of Cheesy Au Gratin Potatoes in the 3 qt.) -- Easy to use, easy to clean, and the recipes are great...what more could I ask."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have purchased a lot of small appliances since about 1976 but this is probably the best one I've ever owned. I purchased this during a daily deal and it took me a while to take it out of the box. Once I did, I have been using it very frequently since then. I have made bone broth, corned beef, ribs & chicken (whole and pieces). Let's just say that each one gets better than the last one. It would be hard to pick my favorite meat in it but chicken and pork are especially good. The seasonings do matter as they come to their full intensity during the cooking.  I especially like Montreal Steak Seasoning. I have also used fresh herbs and they are just wonderful. I am planning on making yogurt next.  I really disliked cleaning it at first because there are several parts but since I have enjoyed the food that it produces so much, I have not been minding it as much!At first it seemed kind of crazy but I can see myself picking up another one of these at some time so that I could make a larger amount for a crowd. The only problem I've found is the capacity of the inner pot. I would love to use it when I have my family over but I doubt that it would be able to make enough for all 10 of us."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"THIS IS THE MOST AMAZING PIECE OF KITCHEN EQUIPMENT.  I bet I use it nearly daily!  Love looking up recipes and trying them!  So simple to use, and the food is sooo good that comes out of it - Meats are so tender and 'infused' with whatever seasonings you use...Just buy one already!!  You will not be disappointed!  I love mine SO MUCH SO, that I'm purchasing now, an 8 quart, as I made a little over 2# Rump Roast last night and it just fit.  If I made much bigger than that, I'm not sure what I would've done - So, I've only been playing with this for a month and a 1/2, but I've made the decision I need another!!  POT-HEADS unite!!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Best kitchen small appliance EVER!!!I'll be honest...I was afraid of this contraption when it came. I was intimidated by all the buttons and the thick user manual. It honestly sat on my counter for a few weeks before I braved myself into using it. Now I laugh at that. (And cry a little because I wasted two weeks in my kitchen without it.) Now that I've played with it, it's become my best friend in the kitchen.I brown my roasts in it with the sauté setting...then in the same pot, I add my liquid and veggies and switch over to slow cook a perfect roast. I cook rice in 5 minutes on the pressure cooking setting. Mashed potatoes are also a breeze with the pressure cooking setting. I've also made a pretty wicked fast potato soup by pressure cooking the potatoes...then switching to sauté mode to add my soup ingredients...best part...only one pot to wash when you are done.One drawback that I noticed, the slow cook setting cooks at a higher temp than what I'm used to. It's not a huge deal. I just have to plan my slow cooking times a little differently now.Bottom line...Buy This Pot.There are so many creative things you can do with it. Electric Pressure cooker hardly begins to describe what this thing is capable of. It turns out, it's not hard to use at all. You are going to love it!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Oh my, I'm loving this kitchen tool...so much more than I expected to. Have used it almost daily since Christmas, trying out recipes, thanks to a ""How to Instant Pot"" cookbook gift by D. Shumski. Pressure cooking and slow cooking and sauteing, Oh My!The 8 quart size is great for me. Plenty of room for soups. Even made yogurt and love it.I think this may have earned a permanent place on my counter. I rarely used my old pressure cooker, but have used this a bunch. Why? Well, maybe because it's touch button. Or because there are so many Pinterest recipes specific to Instant Pot.I have found most recipes for the 6 quart work fine for the 8 quart, though I have increased the pressure cooking time 10-20 percent for  Pressure Cooked ""baked potatoes"" and pulled pork and hard boiled eggs. Maybe I would have needed to with the 6 quart too. I don't know.Order a Glass Lid for sauteeing and simmering. It's handy."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love! I can finally get meals on the table anywhere between 25 and 45 minutes, AND only have one dirty dish to clean!  I’m always pressed for time and it’s difficult to get meals together in a rush with a 3 year old demanding my attention. This has been amazing! I was apprehensive about purchasing, and I was really nervous the first time I used it. I did the recommended “test” before use. I did find the test instructions to be incomplete, and had to refer to other instruction pages in order to feel confident about how to release the pressure and when- so that is my only complaint is the manual is a bit lacking in complete information.Otherwise, this skeptic is now a believer in the Instant Pot. So far I’ve onky used the sauté and pressure cook settings and it’s been great. I can’t recommend this enough for parents short on time.I got the 8 quart and it is MASSIVE on the outside, but the pot size I was looking for inside the massive beast."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"So far I like everything about it!I like being able to put a Large frozen Roast in it and it cooks it to perfection in 2 hours.I cooked many different types of meat in it even frozen Chicken out of the bag ( The entire bag ) at once and it turns out plump and juicy. I have many different soups with it and they have been superb. Only one flop and that was Chile, I soaked and prepared the beans as usual and that isn't necessary. Next time I will wash and sort the beans and them throw them in and let them cook. I bet they will be great."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Best $120 I've ever spent. I'm not new to pressure cookers,  just new to electric ones. Love the safety features and the quality workmanship built into the Instant Pot. Easy to clean and everything I have made has turned out delicious. I've had experience  using pressure cookers, so I didn't find it difficult to master. There are all sorts of u tube videos to walk you through cleaning, maintaining, and using.  Recipes galore with easy to follow instructions. What was intriguing to me, was pressure cooked cheesecakes. I'm testing several for the holidays. Delicious!!! You may think you don't need one, but once you've used it, you won't want to cook without one ; )"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I know it’s all been said and it’s all true. This is the single most used appliance in my house! I cook a lot of very cheap cuts of meat that are donated for the homeless. With this pot, I can turn cheap meat into delicious meals for our city’s homeless. And I use it all the time for my family as well."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have had the 5 qt for about a year and I love it, but always wondered why IP didn’t make a smaller one. When I saw the mini and it was on sale in immediately ordered it. It’s perfect for 1 or 2 people, takes up a lot less space and is cute to boot. I love the mini!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I absolutely love this instant pot. The new auto seal feature is so convenient. So many people have posted the positives about this so I will post my negative. The first instant pot I ordered was actually from Target and it came without the power cord. At first I was extremely annoyed at Target for having sent me either a used or incomplete package, but after reordering it on Amazon and reading some reviews, it seems that instant pot has some quality control issues with not including all necessary parts. So just be wary of that fact."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"The stainless steel pot is very easy to clean.  So far haven’t made too much with this. I’m not super impressed because it is very easy to overcook anything with vegetables in it.  It is good at pressure cooking but annoying for dishes that require you to add different ingredients at different times.  I was hoping to use this instead of a slow cooker but it is not quite what I really want in that department.  I will probably end up using this for cooking meat.  I got the 6-quart which is a manageable size on the outside but there are often times I wish I had gotten the 8-quart for the larger cooking capacity.  This did do a great job of making broth out of a turkey carcass requiring basically zero additional effort.  I also anticipate beans and legumes cooking well with this device, but haven’t tried yet.  Overall, happy with the product but only because I got the Black Friday sale on it.  Definitely wouldn’t pay full price as it is not as multifunctional as the advertising promises it to be."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"The ""max"" line inside this 6 quart Instant Pot is actually at 5 liters. That should be about 20 cups, not 14. There are 4 cups in a quart. A quart is little less than a liter (3.8 liters is a gallon [or more like 3.785 liters...]). Using a glass Pyrex measuring cup, the metric side is correct. The English side of the pot has 3 cups being a liter. Make sure you do NOT use the English side graduations to measure inside this pot. Use your measuring cup instead. I called the company. They were not aware of this error!"
3.0 out of 5 stars,"The stainless pot is very easy to burn on the bottom shutting down the cook cycle. It can be very difficult to get the process restarted when there is a burnt on crust that cannot be stirred or scraped off without emptying the pot and scrubbing with cleansing powder, then restarted, and then it burns again/again/again. Instructions say be sure to use 1 cup of water; I used 4 cups of water! A non-stick pot would make this so much easier so I ordered one."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Excellent product, much more versatile then a stove top pressure Cooker.With the exception of stews,  soups, beans and other items requiring more water, one cup of water is enough to cook roasts, ears of corn, peas, green beans, artichokes, squash, etc.Tip:I always gently remove the silicon seal and wash it, the lid and the inner stainless steel pot when I've finished cooking and wipe/air dry. Cleaning takes less than 10 minutes and there has been no transfer of flavors or lingering odors. I only put the seal back in the lid when next I use the Instant Pot which keeps the seal relaxed and undamaged.Update: Well it's over 1 year since purchase and, following my cleaning tips after every use, the original silicon gasket/seal is in perfect condition, never replaced, and there have never been any lingering odors no matter what's has been prepared.  Preparing corn-on-the-cob is a weekly (almost daily) treat and the Instant Pot works accurately and perfectly every time... Manual setting for 3 minutes full pressure."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is by far the best kitchen countertop appliance I have ever purchased. I was convinced by a friend to give the Instant Pot a try, she even told me when Amazon had them on sale. I received my Instant Pot two weeks ago and have used it five times since then and every thing has come out tasting great. I first made rice just to try out the Instant Pot and make sure I knew how to work the controls, etc. My rice was light and fluffy, the perfect amount of moistness and no boil over on my stove like when cooking in a pan. Next I tried cooking chicken breasts (perfect), tomato soup, chicken vegetable soup and then baked potatoesI am very happy with the Instant Pot and am looking forward to cooking  with it for years to come."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Got this item due to the high number of positive Amazon reviews and we currently live in an older rental with tiny kitchen and no outside exhaust hood. So in the summer you can imagine how hot the kitchen gets. Plus, cleaning up after cooking is a major PITA. Now with the Instant Pot, there's less clean up, the kitchen doesn't get super hot, and you don't have to supervise the cooking. It's fast, convenient and makes tasty food! The recipe book that comes with the pot is very good and the Internet is full of Instant Pot devotees sharing their favorite recipes, which makes learning how to cook in the Instant Pot easy.Bought this on sale over Christmas and it's the best Christmas present! If you love to cook, you should get it. If you love to eat but hate to cook, there're even more reasons for you to get it."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I cook for one or two, and this size is great since it comes to pressure quicker and doesn't take as much counter space as my 8 qt. However, I needed my larger pressure cooker to cook a whole chicken, so I'll hang onto that one too for larger quantities or food that foams. I don't use the preprogrammed buttons much - would rather have buttons that I could assign cooking schedules for - but I love the two temps. Yogurt is so easy to make! I'm waiting for someone to sell lifter that fits the 3 qt. size to aid in removing bowls from inner pot since there is little space between a bowl and the inner pot. Instant Pot quality is much better than that of my other pressure cooker. When the 8 qt goes, I'll definitely replace it with an Instant Pot brand."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Terrific Item..... they have replaced the non stick coating which some people complained about. I have not had food stick.I still have to learn to use the other features, but the pressure cooker aspect is great.It takes 10 to 15 minutes to warm up but that is not a problem. Some complained about that.Really! You expected Instant Pressure?The mesh basket which fits this item is also a great feature. Just snap off the handles with a pair of pliers to fit in pot.No great skill or strength needed. I ordered 2 and used one with the handles on as a colander.*If you get meat on sale (Chuck/Pork Chops, Chicken), put into pot with 1 cup water for 40 minutes and it comes apart like pulled pork consistency."
5.0 out of 5 stars,Easy to use and drastically reduces the time it takes to cook a meal. I was used to the traditional type of pressure cooker that is placed on the top of the stove and refused to use mine for fear of it blowing up in my face. This cooker is so much simpler to use and there is no reason to be afraid of an accident happening. The lid is designed with a safety device so that it will not release if the Instant Pot is still under pressure.Whole meals can be made in the pot and it cuts down on the amount of pots and pans used to prepare a meal. There are many types of delicious recipes on the internet that can be made in the Instant Pot. I purchased an 8 quart and it is perfect for my family of 6.Some people have reported a distinct odor from the ring of the pot. I remove mine as soon as we are done eating and soak it in hot soapy water. I scrub it with a brush and set it aside to dry and I have not experienced any type of odor. I would definitely recommend this product to everyone!

4.0 out of 5 stars,"I do like this tool. However as another writer points out cooking time are way off because they don't consider heat up and cool down times. So in the pot to serving is easily twice as long as advertised. I don't car because I am retired but still misleading non-the -less. It still way faster than a normal crock pot. I did cook a pot roast dinner in just over an hour instead of the 3 to 4 hours in the oven. So that's a plus up. Rice, well the recipe require cooking 2 cups at a time and the wife and I never eat that much at a time. Beans work well as the roast as I mentioned before. Soups are ok too. Sautéing feature save cast iron pang on the stove so another plus. I agree with a previous writer if you need to modify your meal along the way forget. I do like to do that for many things I cook, say marinara sauce or say chilly. What goes into the pot at the time of sealing is what you get out after the pressure is released period. All in all I think I will find this tool useful going forward for one pot meals I want to get done quickly."
5.0 out of 5 stars,I just got this so I can’t attest to its life time use but so far so good.  It was easy to read and understand the instructions and I used it to make rice.  Came out pretty good.  I’m sure with practice it will be perfect.  I debated which size to get.  I’m glad I went with the 6 quart.  I like having left overs so I don’t have to cook as often.  And if you don’t want leftovers you don’t have to fill it.  I really like the stainless steel inner pot.  It lifts out and  It’s easy to clean.  It seems like a good quality pot and I’m looking forward to many experiments.  But mostly I’m looking forward to how quickly food it cooked.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Absolutely in love with this Instant Pot!It has various settings which we use, the most being Sauté and Pressure Cook. It saves us so many dishes and mess in the kitchen by allowing us to do some of the prep steps in sauté and then adding the rest of the ingredients for pressure cook. We have less steps and less cleaning afterwards. The entire cooking process also takes less time, so we are coming more ! 8 qt is also a good size for family size or when you have guests over and/or just want to make leftovers. We do not always use the entire pot, but it is nice to just have one that covers all bases."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought this about 2 months ago.  I. Love. It.  My mother always used a pressure cooker, but the noise  used to drive me crazy.  This is sooo quiet, efficient and easy to use.  Plug and use.  You can saute your aromatics prior to starting the pressure cooker.  You can easily do manual times.  We are vegetarians and I am able to make our ethnic cuisine in minutes using this appliance. There are literally hundreds of recipes online.  I made black beans and garbanzo beans without soaking in less than an hour ( cook and cool down time).  Split beans in less time than that.  I have steamed potatoes, made steel cut oats  as well as apple sauce. I am still trying new recipes.  I even made pasta in a rush before my husband and I went out for the kids. It has the convenience of a slow cooker ""dump and forget""  but allows you to do all the cooking in one pot and faster.  Stainless steel interior easy to clean.  Between this appliance and my Vitamix, I am in heaven.  If you like to cook, don't like slaving over a hot stove or oven and often are needing something fast - this is your appliance."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I finally got to use the ""Air Fryer Lid"" for my instant Pot, and I am addicted!!  The first thing I made was Avocado Egg Rolls....followed by a batch of garlic knots....I would have used it to make something else, but then I used by Instant Pot to make some chili.  I LOVE this new tool for my Instant Pot without trying to find a big bulky spot to store an additional appliance.  My only complaint is that it is fairly small, so you cook in batches....but things cook so quick that it's not a big deal.  For my hubby and I, this is the perfect fit for our meal planning."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"If you only have a room with a sink to live in but have electricity, get this and a cold fridge (not one just for office water). Keep your bathroom sink and counter very clean and clean it right before preparing food. You can have a very healthy and tasty diet with this applicance alone. The only thing I routinely use my microwave for is hot drinks and sometimes a simple egg souffle that I could actually make in the Instapot but might be a tiny bit faster with the microwave. I don't own a stove or any other cooking appliance, and I can many types of food with the Instapot. It doesn't heat up your space like most other cooking appliances do.I have had this product for a couple of months now. It has surpassed my expectations. So far, I have baked gluten free pumpkin bread from a mix in it using the steaming method of baking, steamed eggs for a boiled egg result that peels more easily, made beans and lentil soups from scratch in minutes with no presoaking, baked a chicken, sauteed chicken, made rice and rice with veggies and chicken, made yogurt multiple times, and probably other things but I can't quite remember. I am beyond happy with it. If I only could have one cooking appliance, this would be it, even over a microwave, because it does so much. If you consume yogurt regularly, this will save you so much money that it will pay for itself quickly. I've made yogurt with three different methods, and this is the easiest and most dependable method by far. I highly recommend that everyone who buys this also buy the glass lid made for it. It's what you need to slow cook and to keep things warm unless you want to deal with the pressure cooker lid multiple times when dishing out hot food. When I bake, I make half a recipe and just bake in a small, round, flat corningware casserole dish with a glass lid. You can also use coffee cans to straight sided heat proof jars. Look on the internet for recipes. There are Youtube vidoes and also Facebook groups. I love to cook but live without a real kitchen as I'm in an expensive city and would rather live close to things I like than have more room. So, this is what I do most of my cooking in. If you want to live lean or have an RV with regular electricity hookups or a cabin with power, try this. It won't heat up your kitchen like cooking beans all day or roasting a chicken in the oven will. Still can't believe it makes a batch of nice black beans in 30 minutes or amazing lentil stew in 15. It does have to reach full pressure before those times start, but the smaller quantities get to pressure faster. So, between that and letting it cool a bit so pressure goes down before you open. I'd say if you just want a pound of dry beans to be fully cooked and just rinse, sort, and add them to the water (no more than 2/3 full so prevent overfoaming), put the lid on to seal, and push the button, it would take about an hour from when you walk to your cabinet to get the dry beans to when you open the lid and they are perfectly cooked. Same for lentil stew only because I'd allow fifteen minutes to cut up all the carrots, onions, tomatoes, and other good stuff to add to it."
1.0 out of 5 stars,Firstly this thing is HUGE! The lid is the same size as the instant pot itself.Secondly it doesn't cook evenly. The top of the basket will be overdone and the lower basket will be underdone.Thirdly the capacity is too small you need both parts of the basket to do half a bag of fries.
4.0 out of 5 stars,"One of the best kitchen cookware I've ever had except for ...!  It's not easy to clean.For example:  The top is made out of stainless steel and plastic.  The problem is if food or liquid gets in between the stainless steel and plastic, there's no way to clean it easily without taking out you trusty phillips head screwdriver and separating the two pieces apart.  Then there's the recess area where the lid drops down into so that you can securely turn and close the lid.  Again, food and liquid can get into that area which can be difficult to clean.Other than that, I found a new toy and it works wonderfully!  So far, I have made Beef Stew, Kalua Pork and a Roast.  All turned out excellent and it sure beats out the slow cooker.  Most things can be cooked within 1/2 hour not counting the preparation time.  It's one handy little unit and for a busy family that needs to get food out in a hurry ..... hard to beat!Next up?  Hmmmmm, maybe short ribs?"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've used mine for quite awhile now and I'm still impressed.  I'm not a fan of cooking, so to use this about 4 times a week means my family isn't having ""fend for yourself night"" as often as they have in the past.  Last night it was HUGE baked potatoes that came out perfect and buttery soft after a 20 minute cook and a 10 minute natural release.  I also love fact that rice turns out perfect and I don't have to look at it even once.  It does a great job of not heating the house up too and if you can do your steam releases under your oven vent hood, even better.  I do wish the beeper that tells you it's finished was a little louder.  I miss it sometimes and find it on warm half an hour later.  I did a lot of stressing on whether to get the 6 qt or 8 qt.  If you're trying to figure out which one will be best for your family, then just get an 8 qt. If you cook for more than two people and sometimes have family over you'll end up using it to capacity."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love this thing.  I wasn't sure, and I was afraid it was going to be a gimmicky thing I used 3 times and had to find a storage location for. I don't know how I lived without it.  Within a 2 hour period, I made vegetable stock (from frozen vegetable pieces), used the broth to cook black beans and then used the rest of the broth to make brown rice pilaf--for all of these, it took longer to measure the ingredients than it took me to push buttons.  Steel cut oats turn out perfectly, we braised some smoked chicken in about 20 minutes for perfect pulled chicken, and I love love LOVE the yogurt function.  My crockpots are going into the closet for use when I go to potlucks."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"So far I have used this product to make beans and yogurt. I am very impressed by the way it noiselessly performs its functions, requiring no oversight once the program is set. I found the timing on the yogurt program and the bean program to be a bit on the low side, but easily changed with the controls.  I confess to being too lazy to make beans even using a slow cooker, and annoyed by the odor, so this product encourages me to eat healthier and cheaper; that means the product pays for itself in savings over canned beans and not eating out. For those in small urban apartments, this unit also allows one to discard rice cookers and slow cookers, a space saving. The product is impressively well-insulated on its sides, so less energy is required to heat it, and one can touch the sides without fear; on the other hand, this adds to the time it takes for the pressure to return to normal, which is a reasonable trade off..Expect to spend another seven dollars or so for a thermometer to detect when the heated milk used to make yogurt has cooled to 110 degrees--a surprising oversight in a product that includes a steaming trivet, measuring cup, ladle, and rice server.Customer service picked up the phone immediately and were responsive to my concerns. I trust this company and recommend the product.."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"There is a learning curve to using a pressure cooker, much less a multi-function pressure and non-pressure appliance like this, but if you like to cook, and have the patience to stick with things, this might be a good purchase for you. I am happy I got it.I like one-pot dinners on the weekend, and this excels at them (once you learn how not to get a BURN warning for things sticking to the bottom of the post. Again, there is a learning curve.) I also like the pot in pot and stacked pots options for other types of meals.I got an extra inner pot and a silicone lid so I could pop leftovers into the fridge and still have another pot ready to use.If 8 qt sounds like a lot to you, keep in mind that the fill line for this is only just past the half way line, so it fills up fast with uncooked meat and veggies. That said, this takes up a good bit of real estate on your kitchen counter."
1.0 out of 5 stars,"I really tried to like this item, but it was not meant to be.  For my purposes (cooking rice, oatmeal, beans, soups) the ""Instant"" pot took too long to pressure up, too long to pressure down and provided HORRIBLE results.  I know there is a ""learning curve"" to pressure cooking, but I really don't have the inclination to ""practice"" until I achieve consistent results.  I'll stick to the traditional cooking methods I've been using for decades.  I always get perfect results and it doesn't take much more time.  YMMV  Love Amazon Prime!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I had hesitated for a couple of years about buying one. I wasn't sure I would use it enough to justify the purchase. I found I use it a lot. And with some on line research, I have been able to convert many of my stove top and slow cooker recipes very successfully to an Instant Pot. I really enjoy my instant pot."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have used white rice, porridge, bean/chili, and yogurt functions.The rice it cooked was not as good as that cooked by the rice cooker we have, yet it was definitely OK.The porridge was nice because our rice cooker can't even cook meung beans in the porridge. This cooker can handle all sorts of beans in addition to brown rice in the porridge if I set the time longer.We used bean/chili to cook organic soybeans. Then we use a blender to make organic soy milk. Needless to say, it's very tasty.We used yogurt function a few times. Each time it was a success.This pot is truly very convenient. The ""set it and forget it"" function is especially useful/safe for a forgetful person like me. I would highly recommend it."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Just start using this and I already gave up my rice cooker.  From start to finish it took only 12 mins to cook rice... It takes a while to cool down so you can open it but you can help it along by using a utensil to release the steam. Be careful not to burn yourself!This is just one of the most amazing all in one pot.  I used it more for pressuring but I can't wait to use it for other things.  Highly, highly recommend!  It makes my life so much easier as it cut my cooking time to less than half.  So if you are always short on time, this is the pot for you.  And, for the price, you will not be disappointed."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"I've had my Instant Pot for 4 days now and have made a basic vegetable stock, mushroom soup and rice pudding. I don't eat meat so my main reason to purchase a pressure cooker is to make stocks, soups and beans. The Pot is easy to use. I am unfamiliar with pressure cookers and did do the ""Initial Test Run"" on pg 17 of the manual before I did anything else. Both the basic vegetable stock and the mushroom soup I made came out very well. However, the rice pudding was a huge disappointment due to the fact that even though I thoroughly cleaned the Instant Pot and its sealing ring between each meal I made, the rice pudding's dominant flavor was of the last two recipes I had cooked. The plastic sealing ring in the lid retained the odor (and flavor!) of the stock and mushroom soup. I ended up discarding the rice pudding, it was that awful. I've thoroughly washed and cleaned the sealing ring but it still smells of the first two recipes. I have decided to purchase more sealing rings and switch them around depending on what I am cooking as I see I am not going to get the soup flavor out of the pudding flavor and vice versa. Today I am trying chickpeas in the pot and hoping for success. I'd like to use the Instant Pot as an additional slow cooker and might purchase the separate glass lid for it."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"All around cooking usability is an understatement! The Instant Pot is simply fantastic. Used as a slow cooker or a pressure cooker it is great. Make soups, yogurt, whole chicken, bone broth, gravy, pot roast, beef stew, shrimp scampi, rice, and on-and-on. This appliance can replace most everything you have in your kitchen and cook faster and better while doing it! Buy one and use it for a month and you will understand why everyone is raving about the Instant Pot."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I performed a lot of research regarding electronic pressure cookers, and this one seems to be the best.  I am giving this product a five star rating based on its performance thus far.  I have only used it for slow cooking, fixing rice, and vegetables.  I found that one has to be very careful when cooking fresh vegetables.  The first go around with broccoli did not go well.  My fault, not the cooker.  Slow cooking a less expensive grade of meat turned out well, but did have to go back and finish pressure cooking the meat to ensure that it was more tender.  With the built-in rice setting, cooking rice was a breeze.  Suggest that one follows the instructions that come with the rice.  Over time, with practice and patience, believe that this pressure cooker will turn out to be the best cooking appliance I have.  There is no worry using this electronic  pressure cooker with so many built-in safety measures.  The cooker will beep if the lid isn't closed correctly, the safety valves work fine.  Would also recommend purchasing at least two of the inner pots so that fixing an entire meal goes fast and smoothly.  I also like the Sauté setting especially for browning meat, just be sure to add oil.  The accompanying books do not provide a great deal of information, just explanations of what all of the functions do and their settings.  The recipe book is not very in-depth, but just go online and there is an enormous amount of recipes to choose from.  One last recommendation, before using the pressure cooker, be sure to follow the directions in the Owner's Manual regarding preparation for the first use."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have only been using it for a week and I love the ease and convenience. I throw frozen chicken or pork with some vegetable and rice, some water and 30 minutes later tender delicious meals.Well worth the money. The recipe book is great for ideas and a good starting point."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"The only thing I didn't like was that the price dropped over $10 a week after I purchased this one. Overall this baby is a Godsend. I moved a couple of weeks before  I purchased this and my Landlord had an issue with my gas stove, so I researched for hours and decided to get one. These are the greatest baked potatoes I've ever made, and I consistently make them perfect. I made gumbo for my girlfriend on her birthday and we are both still in shock! I'm getting one for my Son and Daughter-in-law and they are so excited because with their big family they will be able to entertain and let the Instant Pot do all of the cooking."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"The unit itself leaves nothing to desire...it seems to hold up to its rave reviews and #1 purchased pressure cooker status.  There has been a learning curve for me personally as I have had minor failures cooking some foods  the first time around.  So it DOES require reading up quite a bit in order to open the lid  and getting the desired result immediately.  I tried cooking lentils but it took me twice to figure out I needed less lentils and more fluid.  But it did eventually work.My very first meal was the Instant Pot (Umami) Chili.  WOW. That was great and very easy. I'm a chili-head (have competed in cook-offs) and I gotta say this was one of the top 3 chilis I have ever tasted.Possibly the BEST feature I like the most is the STAINLESS STEEL cooking pot. No worries about non-stick scratching or peeling.  I can just get in there and stir, and I can use the Brillo pad to clean it spotless. YAY !!!"
1.0 out of 5 stars,"The instruction manual is useless.The ""quick release valve"" takes in excess of 30 minutes to relieve pressure.The diagrams in the manual do not match up to the pot.If you forget one ingredient and try to stop the cooking within 2-3 minutes, even using the quick release valve, you are screwed.It is not user friendly or intuitive.Returning.  Will stick with my slow cooker.Paid half price on Prime Day and STILL returning it."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have bought duo plus9in1 6 qt, it's convenient and convenient to make large quantities of food, and I can't do without it in all my cooking.  I cooked the chicken on pressure and it was finished in just 7 minutes.  Then I put it on broil, prepared the yogurt, and steamed the vegetables and made the cake faster than a regular oven.  I use it all day as it shortens my time and keeps the kitchen clean from oils and food odors."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"My friend had purchased a 6 quart Instant Pot and highly recommended it.  I decided to go with the 8 quart as I make yogurt once a week in a couple of quart sized mason jars which fit perfectly into the 8 quart unit.  I use this cooker for all sorts of stuff, use it almost every day, and hardly ever use my slow cooker any more.  Come to think of it, I do less cooking on my stove top now.  I can cook hard boiled eggs with this unit that come out so perfectly easy to shell.  The inner pot, steaming rack and silicon ring are easy to clean in the dishwasher (top rack for the silicon ring). The pressure cooker lid is easy to clean by hand.  When I use the pressure release I place a kitchen towel over the release vent to keep the steam jet somewhat under control.  The silicon ring will absorb the smell of whatever is cooking in the pot, and the smell is hard to clean out of the silicon, which is the only slightly annoying thing, but I find it does not ""flavor"" other stuff that I cook in the pot.  I am so glad that I purchased this cooker and I highly recommend it."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"though it does work well even on minute amounts of food.  I just feel ridiculous making a half-cup of rice in it. Or a cup of oatmeal. My fault I should have gone for the smaller-sized one.  The inner pot didn't get squeaky clean in my dishwasher, it left a ""ring"" around the level of the food that had been cooked in it, but it did come off easily in a subsequent handwash with a soft sponge."
5.0 out of 5 stars,Everything as advertised and more.Make stews and roasts in no time flat.Cook today and portion the leftover in to vacuum bags then freeze for later.The down side is that if you have small family you can fill up your freezer in no time flat.
2.0 out of 5 stars,"When I pulled my instant pot out of the box it had a big dent across the front of it. I didn’t want to wait on a new one so I kept it. It worked for about a year. It lost pressure and kept giving me a burn warning. I replaced the seal on it, no change. The kid doesn’t sit tight enough for it to hold a seal. After replacing parts I have finally decided to move on from it. It was nice while it lasted, but I hoped it worked last longer."

5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have thought about getting an Instant Pot for some time, I finally pulled the trigger. I am glad I did. We are loving the ease of cooking food and how something as simple as Corn-on-the-cob comes out so delicious. Don’t try the Chocolate Lava Cake if you lack willpower, you’ll be hooked.PS-check the hot plate retriever tongs sold on Amazon. Makes getting hot ramekins or other items out of the Instant Pot easy."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love cooking, but I don't have the time or the patience for it these days. I've cooked every night since I got the instant pot. It's literally amazing. It's compeletely safe and easy to use. The instructions to set up the pot are not intuitive, so I recommend checking out YouTube. There are so many amazing recipes you can make in this pot too! Desserts, stews, all kinds of pasta dishes, it's awesome! There are also guides online of how to convert your favorite recipes into instant pot recipes. I recommend buying two recipe books off of Amazon to get you started; ""Instant Pot Electric Pressure Cooker Cookbook"" by Laurel Randolph and ""Great Food Fast"" by Bob Warden. Also, the must need accessories for beginners is the clear glass lid, which is helpful for storing leftovers and sautéing, extra sealer rings, because you don't want your cheesecake smelling like beef stew, and a steamer basket for vegetables!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is the gift for the person on your list who likes to cook but is stuck in a rut. Ribs take an hour instead of half a day or more. Meat and veggie meals made easy. Apple cobbler is wonderful. Cauliflower soup comes alive.For the average person, it is a new way of cooking but once they get over the learning curve, it is a whole new experience in the kitchen."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"My husband is a resident physician and I work full-time as an RN. We have two kids who just turned 4 and 6. Our lives are hectic.This pot was recommended to me by other people with lives just as crazy as ours!When husband came home and told me he'd volunteered me to cook an entree for the Pediatric ICU potluck? No problem, I made delicious pulled pork for 30 people in an hour (excluding prep time of maybe 10 minutes). With our traditional crock pot, I had to sear meat in a separate pan, then transfer to the crock, then wait 8-12 hours for pork to be pull-able. This let me sear the meat, switch modes to pressure, put the lid on, and do other things! I love that it minimizes my mess.When I need a side dish for a potluck pronto? I just throw in some potatoes with a cup of water and 30 minutes later I can mash them up and add butter and bacon bits and I have mashed potatoes everyone loves with 0 effort. I love that I don't have to stand over a stove watching potatoes boil. I just throw them in and forget about it until it alarms it's done. I also love that I don't have to pour all the nutrient-filled water out like when I used to have to boil potatoes. This requires such little water that I can just mix it in with the potatoes and no nutrients are going into the sewer (up front, anyway :)  )The pot itself is very high-quality. Durable, and the inner pot is high-quality stainless steel. This thing was made to last. Which is good, because it goes on frequent road trips with me since it's my potluck go-to!!Every time I take this pot to a get together, everyone wants one. We've gone from a family who eats out every night to maybe only eating out for Taco Tuesday. Because now I don't have to plan ahead of time for a roast. All I need is an hour and it's done! Thank you Instant Pot."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"I love this and I am glad I waited for the 8 quart, I can actually fit a whole frozen 5 pound chicken in it and have it done in only an hour.  A pork roast in 40 minutes and bison stew in 20 minutes.  Meatloaf and mashed potatoes in the same pot in 20 minutes.The only drawback I and others experience is the smell left behind in the silicone ring.  I think InstantPot needs to include two rings especially if they market for sweet foods as well."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"OMG! Instant Pot is a total game changer! Dry black beans in 20 minutes? Crazy! Awesome, creamy cheesecake? Amazing! Frozen chicken, done in less than half an hour? Homemade Mac and cheese, easier than a mix? Yes, please! Everyone needs one! I live alone, so got the smaller, 3 qt size, which is perfect for me."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I can't say enough about this IP.  It is so easy to use and there are so many options available for its use.  Besides the terrific pressure cooking option, the availability of the saute feature is such a great tool.  This feature gives you 30 minutes to brown meats and some vegetables to bring out their peak flavors prior to pressure cooking and/or slow cooking.  You can cook dry pinto beans (without pre-soaking) using the pressure cook option for 45 minutes and they are perfectly done.  Unbelievable.  There are some things you wouldn't want to pressure cook, but many of the recipes available online are incredibly good.  It's a product you will find indispensable."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is the third time I buy this product. Once for myself and two as gifts. This gadget is amazing. I’ve had mine for over a year and I make stews, soups, pork tenderloins and even pot roast. It’s simple to use and easy to clean. Have no idea why I slaved away for hours making a pot roast when I could’ve made it with the insta pot for half the time! A must have for those looking to save some time."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"After wanting an Instant Pot for at least a year I recently purchased one on Amazon's ""Deal of the Day"" because of the price point.  I grew up with pressure cooker meals--my mother and grandmother both used them along with many other home cooks.  I have one in the back of a cabinet that I've had for at least 40 years, but it didn't cook well on an electric stove, it was too heavy even before loading it up and not at all fun to clean.  And did I mention noisy.  But the food cooked in it was great!  I was hesitant to buy another new appliance because of the price, and the size.  Long story short I love my Instant Pot.  So far I've made Greek yogurt, cooked a whole chicken with cabbage wedges, made the meat/rice mixture for stuffed peppers and cooked pork ribs, all turning out delicious.  All of these foods took the same amount of time to prep but the time saved is in the cooking time.  You'll enjoy using the Instant Pot."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have a ton of kitchen gadgets and this has replaced several of them. I no longer use the stove top pressure cooker (which was kind of scary), the rice cooker, the yogurt maker, and the slow cooker.One of my favorite features is the delay start. I let the beans soak all day and then the pressure cooker cooks them right before I get home. I only use this feature with beans as I would be afraid meat would spoil. I should also add that the pressure cooker comes up to pressure much faster than the stove top pressure cooker did.I also love the slow cooker feature that cooks for the time you program and then switches to keep warm. No more over cooked mush in the slow cooker!Brown rice turns out fluffy and perfect. I seriously use the InstantPot a couple of times a week.One of the best features is the stainless steel interior which cleans easily and does not leech nasty chemicals into your food. This is one of the only cooks I have found with this feature.This product has saved me so much time and created more counter space since I was able to replace several gadgets with one!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love this thing!  Several friends got an Instant Pot for Christmas and were gushing about it all over Facebook.  I finally bit the bullet and bought one, and I have used it almost every day since I got it.  That's saying something, because I hate to cook.  Easy to use, stylish, and versatile. I commute 80 miles round trip every day for work, and would find myself hitting a fast-food drive-thru on the way home because I'd be too tired to cook.  Having this Instant Pot has changed all of that.  There's very little I can't make with this in 30 min or less. It ""bakes"" potatoes, ""boils"" eggs, makes perfect rice, sautes and has a crock pot feature.  And clean up is a breeze, because it's just one pot.  There are a lot of YouTube videos that demonstrate how to use the pot, and you can find a lot of easy recipes online (Pinterest, Facebook, etc.).  I loved mine so much, I bought one for my step-daughter and one for my cousin too!"

Look for when it is a lightning deal for under 80 bucks and you will be happy all day. Apparently love of this thing is cult-like, so when you get one, look on FB if you do that sort of thing for IP groups. Lots of cool tips. If you have been humdrum about cooking, this might light the fire again. Also apparently the love of these things is so great there is even a trend for people to put decals on them to customize... seriously, it is a thing.. I don't judge."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love my Instapot. For many things it’s not really any quicker because of the 15 min pressuring up time before cooking starts and depressure time before you can open it, but somehow it seems so easy and fast. I’m on Dr Gundry’s low lectin diet (see youtube if you have health challenges) and more meals go in the pressure cooker than don’t. The 8 quart plus a frying pan of extra veggies and greens makes about 6 meals for 3 big eater adults. I start soups and stews with 2 sliced onions on Sauté for 20 min while cutting veggies. When done I just add the veggies and frozen chicken thighs or fresh ground turkey or whatever, a small tomato paste, a quart of chicken or bone broth, spices, press the stew/meat button and end up with a delicious soup/stew. That may not sound that different from what you’d do in a regular soul pot but somehow it is..."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Fabulous device. I finally gave up on my (otherwise wonderful) Zojirush rice cooker. The Teflon had begun peeling off the cooking pot inside it, so... rather than pay $60 for a new pot for the Zojirushi, I bought the Instant Pot.This thing, as you can read from all the other reviews, kicks brown rice and in only 15 or 25 minutes! I lived in Japan and have eaten short-grain, organic brown rice for many decades...hence springing for a relatively expensive Zojirushi in the first place.The Instant Pot cooks my rice better and faster in a nicely-weighted stainless-steel pot, without any downside from peeling chips. There's also no penalty from the lack of a Teflon coating. The rice comes out perfectly and the pot almost rinses clean... it requires no scrubbing at all.Something I've always done: A few splats of olive oil (or coconut oil if it's for breakfast) in the pot before cooking and the rice is wonderfully ready for eating and may help make cleanup even easier."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought this to replace a slow cooker that broke after a little over a year. I had my previous slow cooker for 20 years and loved it, but it started having electrical problems. I replaced it with a popular name brand crock pot that boiled on warm and hated it from day one. After the heavy ceramic crock broke after a 1-inch drop into the sink during cleaning I did a lot of research and decided on this Instant Pot. I’ve only had it a few months, but am very happy with it. I have only used the sear, slow cook (read the instructions and turn the knob on the top to venting!!!) and pressure cook functions, but I love it! There are tons of recipes online for this thing and I’ve even cooked a whole chicken FROZEN with wonderful results, which helps on those days when I haven’t planned ahead. Although there are cheaper models that have more functions, I chose this one because of the 8-quart size and I’m glad I did."
1.0 out of 5 stars,"Missing water condensation cup. Warranty information is suppose to be on bottom of pressure cooker, but there is nothing on the bottom. Made corn on the cob, steamed 1 minute, with water, and the pressure  ""burnt"" on display. What happened to the warm function? I think mine is defective. No cookbook. I made beans and the water was about 1.5 inches below the 1/2 mark and there was water spurting out of the valve. I've been using a pressure cooker for 5 years and not had this issues with the first pressure cooker."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm not sure if I can add anything that hasn't been said yet about the wonders of this machine.I've had slow cookers before, and liked the ""can put the food in and forget"" but didn't always enjoy the planning that requires to put your ingredients in 8 hours before eating....I also own a stove-pressure cooker.. that I had never used cause, of course, it means you need to be in the kitchen with a watchful eye on that little steam safe valve, timing exactly the moment the valve starts to move... just the opposite of ""put the food in and forget""I've never own a rice cooker, even though I wanted one, cause most of them have non-stick (aka toxic) inner pots and they just cook rice....And so, when my husband comes and tell me about this little wonder and, very politely insinuates that we could give it a try (I'm not that much of a cook, so anything that helps our household to get homemade meals, it's welcome) I though it was a brilliant idea and had the best of all worlds (put food and forget, as quick or slow as you need it, no need for a separate yogurt maker, and inner pot made of stainless steel).I read the articles, viewed the videos and ordered it in Amazon.... all in 1 day.Seriously, this is better than I thought. Although I'm still tinkering with the timings for some things, in the 2 days that I've had it, I've made already orange lentils, chickpeas with tomato, and chicken with potato stew (yes, chicken is also possible if you stick to 8 min only and fast pressure release, not something I'd have tried in a slow cooker). I've used mainly the saute and pressure options, and notice that, if you use the ingredients in cold, it may take some time for the pressure to build, but if you have used the saute option in advance (and therefore your pan and your ingredients will already be hot), the pressure builds up really quickly and everything gets done in no time.I haven't tried it yet for rice (although everybody raves about the great risottos) or yogurt, but those are my next steps.What I really like? Not only the ""put food in and forget"", but also that it cleans soooooo easily (just the inner pot, no handles or other messes...)Great addition to our kitchen and our health!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,I bought this to replace my Sekura pressure cooker that broke. I love the 8-qt size but am disappointed the air fryer lid only fits the 6-qt pot. My fingers are crossed that IP makes one for 8-qt pots soon!
5.0 out of 5 stars,"OMG! I love this cooker. Since the day it arrived I have loved cooking with it. I am quickly working my way through the recipe booklet, and with the charts given for types of foods(how long to cook them) it is easy to adapt other recipes to use in this. As an example I am able to make a pot of 10 bean soup (one of my families favorites) in about 1 hour and 45 min, starting from unsoaked beans! The broth comes out rich and the beans perfectly cooked without being mushy or under-cooked. A wonderful roast we did only took an hour and a half. A 7lb roast with carrot, onion, garlic, celery, and very small red potatoes. I was able to brown the sides of the roast right in the cooker using the saute setting, so the deglaze all went directly into the flavoring of the roast. A green chili, pork chili was absolutely one of the best I have ever made, after an hour in the pot, the pork simply fell away from the 2 bones and I just gently removed them.The unit adds no heat to a room,so this is great to cook with here in the burning hot south and not have to endure the temp going up 25 degrees in the kitchen while slow cooking something. I also want to add I almost never add any salt to food cooked in the unit, everything is so flavorful,  it does not need it.Honestly I wish I had ordered this unit so much earlier."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have used a pressure cooker for several years and the Instant Pot is a perfect replacement.Depending on what you are cooking it can be a dump, set and go about your business tool!  Whereas with the pressure cooker on the stove you have to pay attention and time it and turn off the stove.  I love the instant pot!  I use it weekly to cook chicken for the dogs, then always make a soup with the bone broth!  I have yet to try any dessert or yogurt yet.  I did try the sauté mode and it was pretty cool!My only wish is that there was a good cookbook with more variety in it."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm not one to follow fads; this was a reluctant purchase based on the recommendation of a friend and the fact that I have started an accelerated master's level nursing program so I needed a speedy solution for dinners for my family of 4. I have to say that I'm very pleased with this product. It arrived as advertised, brand new in box. As far as the overall use is concerned, I have made very tender pork ribs twice, I've steamed broccoli in less time than required on the stove, and did a one-pot beef stroganoff that turned out perfectly--meat was insanely tender and the noodles were perfectly al-dente. I'm looking forward to using this frequently and finding more recipes to try."
2.0 out of 5 stars,"After having this for just under 2 years, I have come to experience two big problems with Instant Duo.1)  On Saute mode with more function switched on, after about 5 minutes the cookers stops heating. The only way to start saute is to restart and hit saute again. This problem first came to notice after a year of using this for about 10 - 15 times. Now this is becoming more frequent. Keep having to switch it off and on repeatedly is annoying.2) on Manual cooking, even with enough water to generate steam, the little metal bit stays open and steam leaks around it. Then the timer starts counting down without really cooking under pressure.I have had this product just under 2 years and used about 30 times. Well cleaned and maintained.These two problems can only be assumed to be software / circuitry problems embedded in the product. I tried to reach out to the company but heard nothing back.The manufacturer has to recognize this and correct these problems in their future production.And all the prospective buyers, be aware of these problems."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I went Instant Pot crazy after buying it and have made everything I can think of in mine.  Very easy to get up and running with it - lots of buttons on the panel, but well written instructions/explanations had me off and running with almost no need to return to the manual to re-read.  Highlights for me were having a 4lb pot roast with all the veggies ready to eat in under an hour (tasted like it slow cooked all day), making chili and forgetting to soak the beans - no worry, used the right setting to give the beans a quick start, and with that and additional prep time included, we had FANTASTIC chili in under an hour and being able to do multiple things such as saute then go straight to pressure cooking mode, etc.  I don't think there is anything limiting what can be done with this thing other than the size of the pot itself."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"I never thought I would use one of these, but I love it.  Today in preparing for a BBQ, I used the Instant Pot to boil potatoes for potato salad, hard boiled 7 eggs, cooked ribs, and made corn on the cob. One of the factors for its success is the excellent stainless steel insert, which is extremely well-made, doesn't warp, and cleans up really easily between uses.  I always brown meat before braising or stewing, so I love this feature.  I've used it for pot roasts, short ribs, pasta casseroles, whole chicken, and many other dishes.  I found a good cook book , and checked out the many YouTube videos out there to get started. I reserve the fifth star because it's sometime tricky to get the silicone ring just right, but I'm better with practice.  I'm so happy with this product."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I read all the ratings about this instant pot-I really do pay attention to the negative as well as positive- however, I follow Nom Nom Paleo's blog and this pot came highly recommended...So being the crazy gadget junkie that I am (some are crazy cat ladies, I'm a crazy gadget lady...but I do have a cat or two, grin) I jumped into the pool. A while back, after coming to grips with the fact that I have a kitchen gadget addiction, I made a bargain with myself that for every new appliances/pot/kitchen thing I get, I'll get rid of something...I refuse to let my kitchen erupt...anyway, back to the instant pot...I recieved it, and (metaphorically) clutched it in delight and made a special place on the counter for it. I read the directions...they were understandable enough, and I looked through the accompanying recipe book, which, sigh, I found rather useless. Frankly, I get better recipes doing a google search...their recipes aren't your basic meatloaf or pot roast recipes. Theirs were turnip cakes...(really? I can't ever remember eating one, or wanting to try one!) and the like. So I find recipes on line and adjust them to accommodate what I need. That said, I'm delighted with my instant pot. I don't have a microwave and this is the next best thing. It's quick to cook or heat up leftovers, easy to figure out, easy to clean and I'm pleased with my recipes. I live in the south, my kitchen gets hot, and this pot allows me to cook efficiently and quickly without heating up too bad. It's a win win...I have used the slow cook function and it works great as well. I have not used the yogurt function. It seems lengthy and time and labor intensive compared to my simple heating milk, adding culture, letting it sit in a thermos overnight method. I realize I'm rambling....I love my instant pot and I tell every one about it, in spite of the eye rolls and/or blank stares...(I'm so misunderstood! And no, I am not interested in a gadget 12 step program...I can control this)"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love my replacement Instant Pot!!!  I bought this because we are having to travel for work and needed something multi-functional and compact to take and keep with us.  I am just beginning to discover the beauty of having this appliance.  I have used a slow cooker and pressure cooker for a long time, but love having both functions combined so that I can sauté/brown the ingredients, before slow cooking or pressure cooking.Sadly, the first one that was sent to me was completely busted/fried.  It appears that it had gotten wet, and then when the first person who ordered it plugged it in, it fried the circuitry, or so my husband said.  It smelled horrible.  This was a disappointment, because I had to wait another week to receive the replacement, which was not the normal Prime service.Thankfully I know own a great product and will have it to use on upcoming business trips."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Had never heard of an instant pot until a video came up in my yt feed. I thought my wife might like it, as she likes kitchen gadgets, so I bought the 8 qt. We have four kids. There is a bit of a learning curve, but once one gets the hang of it, it works great. As a yogurt maker it's awesome. We made yogurt in the oven, and it was hit or miss. This takes the guess work out of it. A half gallon of milk, hit the yogurt button until ""boil"", wait until it cycles, take the lid off and cool to 110F, add starter, put lid on, and hit yogurt button for 10 hours. Ten hours later, yogurt. We put ours in the fridge overnight without stirring, and it's very creamy. I recommend."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"I love it, except I wish it were bigger.  I originally loved it, and I thought problems I was having with overflow was just my needing to get used to a pressure cooker at all.  I believed I had received the IPDUO60 (which is what I had ordered and paid for). I had no reason to think otherwise, except for the fact that recipes scaled for 6 qts kept coming out wrong due to the fact that my cooker was, in fact, too small. Having gained confidence in myself, it occurred to me to check and see if the problem lay in the cooker, rather in my poor measurement skills.  Nothing on the cooker itself indicates whether it is a 5 qt (which I hadn't know existed at the time of purchase) or a 6 qt. It just says IP-DUO on the front, and all literature for it says IP-DUO50-60.  However, today I actually measured the amount of water it took to fill the insert, and it took 5 qts! Granted, it was over a year ago that i made this purchase and received the wrong product, but in all fairness, I believe a correction is in order.  I had become so dissatisfied with the size of what I believed was the 6 qt cooker that I owned, while still liking the cooker otherwise, that I was about to purchase the 8 qt cooker, when I thought, ""Wait a minute. Before I spend all that money, let me see if my cooker really is what it claimed to be in the first place."" I wish I had had that thought a year and a half ago. Perhaps I would not need the 8 qt cooker if I really had received the 6 qt cooker, I believe, in fairness, that i should be able to return this 5 qt, which I hadn't ordered for a 6 qt, for which I paid, and see how much better my cooking experience might be."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"As so many others attest - this is a wonderful cooking device. I used regular pressure cookers in the past and they were a bit of a pain. It was just about impossible to cook veggies in an old style pressure cooker without it turning to mush . But with the Instant Pot you can use the low pressure setting and just a minute or two to cook firm veggies like broccoli and carrots. I like to just put a few different kinds of veggies in a small stainless steel bowl, put that on the rack , and just give them a couple minutes and I get great results. I also use my Instant Pot for soups, brown rice, and even cook whole wheat pasta in it with perfect results and no draining of water.The first thing I noticed about my Instant Pot was that it looked like it was built with quality materials and care. And that is what I have experienced that this kitchen tool will last a long time.Like so many others have said - I love it !"
5.0 out of 5 stars,This lid eliminates the need for several appliances and if you live by yourself as I do you don’t have to turn a your big oven to cook for example a few French fries or 1 piece of chicken
1.0 out of 5 stars,"I only used the product 6 times. Went to use a 7th time and it won't turn on, like at all. Yes the lid is fully closed, yes the seal is good, yes I tried different outlets. I bought it Dec 2nd of 2019. Pressure cooking technology has been around for literally hundreds of years. If you can't make a product that will last months get out of the business and leave it to the adults in the room.(Updated) Good luck with tech support, Friday at 1749 they are not available on any medium. Purchase if you dare."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have been wanting an air fryer for quite some time now, but I just couldn't bring myself to purchase another appliance - space in my kitchen is already non existent. When a friend told me about this, I ordered it immediately, and boy am I glad I did! It is so easy to use. I have been air frying everything I can think of. I do wish it were a little bit smaller, but that's just me being picky."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Literally a must have for meal prepping: makes a week’s worth of rice for one person in 24 minutes and then 5 pounds of chicken in 34.It’s literally helped me lose weight and replaced my George Foreman grill and dedicated rice cooker the DAY i bought it.It’s also enabled me to not be so wasteful with the meat I buy as you can cook it all at once , which prevents you from having those instances of forgetting you have meat in fridge you forgot to freeze or cook as the Insta Pot can cook even straight up FROZEN chicken in 12 minutes a pound."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"This product works well, and I should have understood that the cooking area would be limited.  The tray between the two cooking areas is tough to grab.  I wish it came with a tool to lift up the middle tray, especially considering that you’ll need to turn your food over during the middle of cooking."

3.0 out of 5 stars,"*IS NOT COMPATIBLE WITH AIR FRYER LID*I was at first skeptical when everyone started talking about Instant Pots, I really thought it was another ""kitchen gadget"" phase thing. However, I did need a pressure cooker, and since The Pot is only slightly bigger than a large pressure cooker, I got it. I really like making stock and non pre soaked beans in it.*however*, you WILL NOT be able to add on to this model. It's not like a kitchen aid where you can get compatible accoutrements. If you're at all thinking you might want the air fryer, you *will* have buyers regret if you buy this one (and possibly have to retract your argument with your housemate that Instant Pots are like Ninja foodies :'-( )"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Hands down my new favorite appliance! I made a deal with myself that if I bought this I would use it at least once a week. Well, I’ve done that and so much more! Great product! I recommend buying extra seals if you plan on making both sweet and savory dishes otherwise your cheesecake may have a hint of soup flavoring lol"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I... I love this thing. I can't express properly through words just how much I do. I really do. If you have any reservations about purchasing this;""Oh... But I have a really nice rice cooker...""- So do I. Zojirushi rice makerr. Only had for about a year and a half. I sold it after the first batch of rice I made in this. With beans. All dry. in under an hour.""But my crock pot is from my grandmother...""- Yeah, cool. But can your grandma's crock pot make beef roast in 20 minutes??""BUT THEY EXPLODE""- Only sometimes! YOU SHOULD LIVE LIFE ON THE EDGE. This is a very wide edge, less scary. And the flavor your get is an equal exchange for that 'threat'!I was really on the fence with this. But I've made black beans and rice, chili, stews, ribs and a few other meaty dishes in here. And it's. AWESOME. Ribs fall off the bone, the bone marrow runs out like a thick soup. Pot roast in less than an hour that you can cut with a spoon. TURNIPS SO TENDER YOU THINK YOU'RE DREAMIN'! And the broths. AUGH. When everything cools, it turns into a perfect meat jelly. The fat and juices intermingle so well. I have been singing the pressure cooking praises since I got it. Hooh.EDIT: 'bout a year later and STILL COOKIN'. It's a magic food pot still and I absolutely stand by it."
3.0 out of 5 stars,"Purchased this product to reduce my number of kitchen appliances. Main plan was to use this as a slow cooker. Had to keep extending the cook time and never got the food tender like a traditional slow cooker. I searched reviews more closely and found this is a common problem. Very disappointed, will try the suggestion to pressure cook, then use the slow cook feature. If that doesn't work, will probably buy another slow cooker."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Oh, Instant Pot! Where have you been all my life?I think I might be the last person in the country to knuckle and buy an Instant Pot. Mine arrived today and I used it for dinner. The pot roast and vegetables I used to put in the Crock Pot in the morning went into the Instant Pot today at around 5 p.m. We ate fork-tender pot roast and veggies at 6:00 p.m.And the good news is that I didn't even blow up the kitchen or scald myself! (Trust me. Those were both possible outcomes. I'm a terrible cook.)So now I get to hit Pinterest to find easy, foolproof Instant Pot recipes. I probably won't be heard from again until 2025 or so..."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I’ve used this instant pot for a while and it’s going great so far. I use it to make soup, rice, steam fish, and Other things. It’s very convenient and I use the timer function quite often. The only downside may be that it takes a while to let the steam out. I would buy again!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This particular Instant Pot is a MUST have for any kitchen!  I had never used a pressure cooker before and was frankly a little nervous to try it.  A friend brought her's over to my house and we made dinner with it.  It was fabulous.  I can't believe how easy, and versatile it is to use.  I have literally used it just about every day since it arrived.  I love it and highly recommend it!  The best money spent on a kitchen appliance other than my mixer!!"
4.0 out of 5 stars,"The goodEverything about the pressure cook aspect is amazing!  Works perfectly for recipes designed for pressure cooker!  No complaints!The badIt's a downright terrible slow cooker.  Sure, it has slow cooker options but the meat is never tender!  I am actually insanely disappointed in that aspect and really dont want a separate slow cooker but I cant use it in this capacity.  Same goes for slow cooker recipes you try to convert to pressure cooker.  They dont turn out nearly as good"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Buy an instant pot cookbook and just amaze yourself and everyone else.  This thing is amazing.  I call it one of my children, thats how much I love it. I use it almost every night.  Ive made all kinds of dishes that are flavorful, tender, never burned, easy to clean up.  I cant say enough good things about the instant pot.  I've made beans, ribs, Chinese dishes, Italian dishes, cheesecakes, flags, short ribs, soups in thing.  Can't wait to take it on the road for RV camping.  Love it!"
1.0 out of 5 stars,"well I did LOVE my Instant Pot - make yogurt and everything in it now, so easy and quick!!!But in less than 4 months of use, it died, it won't heat up, all the lights come on, everything is sealed, but it doesn't get hot.  I filled out the manufacturer's return almost a week ago and NOTHING from them.  I bought the 4 year extended and they won't do anything until the one year manufacturer's expires.  And I see NO OPTION to return/replace to amazon.  Needless to say, I'm more than annoyed.  I use this all the time.  Apparently the manufacturer doesn't care after you guy it, I guess I'll look at a different brand!!  Hey AMAZON, you going to do anything here????"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"It's a wonder to see all the grease/oil/fat from the food that I'm air frying gathers at the bottom of the Instant Pot, instead of going into my body & clogging my arteries.Here's a hack for the lazy ones: line the bottom with parchment paper; or you can place a round foil plate and throw out all the grease to the trash. Don't pour oil into the sink especially if you are in an area with cold weather. The grease hardens and clogs the pipes. We learned the hard way and had to change all our drainage pipes.Air fry as much as possible and use cooking oil sparingly, you'll be healthier in no time."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love it!  I had no idea how fast it cooks things.  And, if you are on facebook, and I am, just join Instant Pot for Beginners.  OMG!  They helped with a recipe for chicken breasts and veggies.  But first I did the water test to make sure it was working.  I can't wait to make yogurt!!  You can't go wrong with this pot.  Can find all kinds of recipes online, especially You Tube.  Just don't buy extras, check online or reviews from people to see if  you need them."

This manual is 59 pages. Easy to print off. I don't see any other way to get to this updated manual which is from instant pot but not on their website."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"I really like this  pressure cooker. But there is one problem; the product I received is a version three, the manual that accompanies this product is written for version two.  I called customer service and they said that there is no manual for version three but it is in production. The problem is that the buttons are different on the front and unless you are an experienced user with the pressure cooker you would not know how the machine functions.  Also most of the instant pot cook books are written for version two. For example the product I received does not have a manual button as is indicated in the instant pot user manual. So after calling customer service I found out that there is a button at the bottom called pressure cooker and that takes the place of the manual button. I would not of known that  had I not called customer service. This pressure cooker functions beautifully and the only reason it got four stars is because of the User Manual  not being for this particular product.  So when you order this know that going in you are going to receive a version three but will not have a manual that specifically is written for that version."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have had one for  a long time - cook dry beans and chickpeas all the time - use to take many hours in the slow cooker and now only 1.5 hours and they taste great. I cooked short grain brown rice and it was the best rice I have ever had, period. So I bought another for $59.00 on sale so I can make beans and rice in separate pots at the same time. Then they went down to $49.00 and I bought one for my mom."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Got this to cook with, then had to move, been in storage since getting it.  :(  But finally got to put this thing to the test. Tried a pot roast (chuck) using the pressure-cooker function for 1.25 hrs. The meat turned out tender, juicy, and delicious. My only complaint was that I put the veggies in with the roast, which the pressure cooker turned them into flavorless mush IMO. That's not a check against the Instant-Pot though, I think that is just since I am a newbie to pressure cooking. Next time I think I will cook just the roast by itself, and do the veggies separately. Need to do a bit of reading and research on how to get the most out of this guy, but I see a lot of potential! Def worth it!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm in a mommy group and have seen a few moms post that this is the best appliance they own.  I'm not much of a cooker and i usually forget to defrost meat in the fridge.  I've decided to give this pot a try as I've purchased this on sale on black friday.  I can honestly tell you that I LOVE THIS POT.  Not only is this pot so easy to use, but you can set it and forget it.  I've made soup, pasta, porkchops, chicken, vietnamese noodles, curry, chocolate cake and many more!  There are so many recipes you can find online.  You can also do your own thing and add whatever you want in it.  There may be a trial and error process, but it's fun to see what you can make in the pot.The only thing that is a little annoying is that once you set your timer, the pot takes about 10-15 minutes to actually start the countdown.  The pot does take a little while to warm up and get it to the temperature where it starts the timer countdown.  So, if your recipe says 15 minutes, it's actually 25-30 minutes cook time.  I usually do manual quick release for everything i cook because natural release takes anywhere between 15-25 minutes and I feel my food is overcooked by that time.My husband and I are planning on buying a 2nd one because one pot is really not enough if you have a big family or parties.  Looking forward in trying more recipes!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,Where have you been all my life! Living alone the 3qt works for me I’m able to prepare then freeze meals that are healthy and easy! I was afraid of pressure cookers but a friend convinced me this one was simple and easy—safe when you follow directions.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"After reading so many articles online and seeing so many YouTube videos I decided to take a chance and buy an instant pot. I had a feeling that it might be overhyped but thought it might be worth it. I work out a lot and so I meal prep often. Before the instant pot the crock pot that I owned saw plenty of use. After a couple of times of using my instant pot, I gave away my crockpot. This thing blows it away! One of the things I used to do is put frozen chicken in my crock pot. It would take about 9 to 10 hours for it to cook thoroughly. I literally put frozen chicken in the instant pot the other night and it took less than 30 minutes to fully cook through. I was blown away! I've even hard boiled eggs in this. This was definitely a purchase I am happy with. It has saved me so much time! You know what they say- time is money"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Purchased via Warehouse Deals. Arrived in pristine condition, despite being noted as defective. Have used it regularly over the last month for both slow cooking and pressure cooking and have loved it. Make sure when pressure cooking to use adequate liquids. A lack thereof will cause scaulding to occur therefore triggering the pot to hault cooking and display a ""BURN"" notice on screen. This is a pain for the cook, as they have to off load all the pot ingredients, and remove burnt food from the bottom of the pan before trying again. I'm a novice at pressure cooking, so this is more my lack of experience more than anything, but wanted to note it nonetheless for anyone else who may want to experiment with this cooking method."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"There is much to enjoy about this particular product. It works just as suggested although it would be nice to have more specific information on how to adjust timing for different altitudes.With abundant recipes and ideas of how to use the instant pot online , you can't help but be successful. Wish it came in the color red to match the rest of my appliances but that aside I would suggest this product for anybody.  I think would make a great gift if that's the price range of the gifts you give, especially to people who have limited time for cooking such as busy moms working families and those who want to keep it in something like an RV for travel . The only caution I have is to make sure you add the time that it needs to pressure up and pressure down from starting the recipe to serving it to your family ."
3.0 out of 5 stars,"Pressure cooker meets slow cooker.  You need to re-learn all your recipes all over again (mostly by trial and error) or you will get a watery mess. I like that you can just forget about it after you start it, and things stay warm until you decide to return. I have an old slow cooker,  now collecting dust and taking up space. After the Instantpot honeymoon, I tried to store it away too, but it's so big (6qt) I could not find any shelf tall enough! Its forgotten once you move it down stairs -- maybe bring it up for the winter soups and stews. (see photo - 12 inches high with lid inverted.)"
4.0 out of 5 stars,"Okay, I love my instant pot.  I use it multiple times a week.BUT, last night for instance, I made chili and used the ""chili"" setting and it alerted me ""burn"" and infact the bottom was burning.Every time I have tried to make something that is not soup, boiling pasta, making rice, or steaming veggies - it burns.Kind of annoying.  I'm sure its user error but I can't seem to figure out what the problem is.I turned the pressure level down to low, normal - STILL burns.It'd be nice to make something that isn't soupy in it."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love it.  I love how tender it makes meat and how easy beans are to make.  The best is how easy hard boiled eggs peel when made in this pot.  It can't correct all my bad cooking choices but sure does help with many.  Ribs that fall off the rib, chicken and turkey that is juicy, and pot or pork roast that is fall apart tender.  All made easy with this pot.One note:  Never let hard boiled eggs slow release.  They still peel easy but no one cares because they are inedible.  Like I said it can't correct all my mistakes.The best advice I read here was to get a second insert pot.  So often I make a meat and vegetables and having a second pot makes that much easier."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is a gamer changer for us in food preparation. I've never used a pressure cooker before so I cannot compare it to others. However, what it does for us, a family off four, makes for incredibly delicious meals not experienced by use before. Pork ribs and chicken are sou tender and just fall off the bone. No more cleaning oil or grease from the oven or stove and it cooks so quickly. It's easy to clean! The pot and entire lid can go in the dishwasher.The only thing I would say is a little misleading are the cooking times. Yes it does cook quickly but there is a 5 minute time required for the pressure to build. So something that cooks in 15 minutes is more like 20. Nitty that's not really a big deal."
2.0 out of 5 stars,"I absolutely love my Insta pot, just received the air fryer later today. Very disappointed that there was not a single recipe or any decent instructions to let me know how to use it. The basics were there but I have dozens of questions unanswered. I tried the website and it is useless. So I guess this will be trial and error."
5.0 out of 5 stars,The only thing I regret is not buying it sooner. This instapot duo is the most versatile and amazing cooking tool ever...Honestly..I was scared of it at first. I put my big girl panties on and went for it. I made large limes with Hickory farms ham... dry beans at that. It took 25 minutes once it got to the pressure and they were to die for.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I would give it one less star for lack of explanation of timing (it takes a bit to come up to pressure, then the clock starts, but I don’t recall that being noted in any of the literature), but Youtube helped with that easily enough.  The amazingly easy and effective pressure cooking process with this appliance makes up for it too.  Any kind of meat and vegetable recipe turns out perfectly, like you cooked it for hours in the oven or on the stove. I also love that there’s no aftertaste like there is with my crockpot. Pressure cooking isn’t new. We had an old stove top one passed down from my Grandmother.  But this takes pressure cooking to a whole new level, more safely and easily."

I love the saute feature where I can through in my aromatics or a mirepoix (or trinity for my cajun cooking) and saute before throwing liquids. I can even deglaze the liner with wine or broth before putting in the rest of the ingredients and cooking. The various pressure settings for the steamer are great for cooking a variety of things. The automated temperature control and pressure control make life simple. I even got a warning about scorching with a soup and the unit turned the temperature down to prevent scorching until I could get in and stir things.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I use my Instant Pot a lot! It is a great time saver and is easy to use. I have given several of these as gifts because I think they are a must have tool. The only significant complaint I have is that the silicone seal retains odors. When you cook a savory dish containing strong flavors such as onions or garlic, the silicone seal will hold onto the scent regardless of how you try to clean it. I purchased extra seals for this reason. It's not really a problem with the function. It is just kind of weird. Despite this, I would buy another one without hesitation."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I resisted getting one of these for a long time because I hated the idea of another 'appliance' sitting around, getting used only once in a while.  That said, I have zero regrets and am glad I added this useful tool to my kitchen.  It is excellent for cooking dried beans and grains of all types, and great for making certain dishes, like risottos and soups.  The steam feature works well too.  One caution, do not let a fresh green vegetable see the inside of this pot unless you want a mushy, overcooked result."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Very useful. Wife loves it, and she is quite skeptical about any gadgets I get, thinking that I won't use it enough and it will just take up space. She fell in love with it after her first time using it and she didn't even read instructions. She pressed saute, cooked some stuff in it, added other ingredients and pressed the Chili button. I wasn't around and was pretty nervous about what might have happened but she had no problem with it (though some beans were slightly underdone... so she probably should have read the instructions).Saute gets very hot, make sure plenty of liquid/fat in there. Doesn't seem to be a way to control temperature for it, but maybe I need to give manual another look. The manual is pretty wordy and could be clearer. Same goes for the recipe book. They are not put together very coherently. Wish it a better guide but able to work things out by looking at various recipes or cooking times. I think it will become easier to wing it and be able to predict results after I have much more experience and just treat it like another cooking tool.I've been using it for making rice and quick soups and stocks. Makes perfect rice. Soups definitely very flavorful in a short period of time. Enjoy doing chicken in it.Was intimidating at first and seemed like cleaning might be a pain as well as little parts that might need cleaning... but not an issue. As long as you don't overload it or put something sticky or burn something in there... the bowl washes easily and the lid and gasket and vent usually good with a quick rinse. No issues with clogging.Have not tried slow-cooking in it. That will be next as I just got some slow-cooker recipe books."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"When it works, it worked okay. The problem we have been having with it is that the lid doesn't seem to seal correctly and the pressure won't build up. I can fool around and lift and push the lid down and sometimes the pressure indicator will pop up. I have to hold the lid in this position until the pressure builds up enough to hold it up and in place. Once that happened, the food inside cooks properly. If that doesn't happen, the chicken doesn’t thaw, the roast doesn't cook, the rice never gets done, etc. We have had the unit since early 2015 but my wife almost always did all the cooking with it and she would complain off and on about its lack of functionality. I started cooking more lately and wanted to utilize this on most meals because it is supposed to make life simpler. That's when I notice the flaw and inconsistencies with the lid sealing. I cleaned the lid, the rubber seal; I boiled water to see if the stream would clean something out but to no avail, I can't get it to work properly. The unit isn't that old or has it been used every single day, I would think that the last thing we have done is worn it out. I think it is defective, at least the lid. I wished it did work, like I said, when it does pressure up, it cooks the heck out of the food, makes things very tender and delicious. I won't recommend this brand again but I would recommend pressure cooking."
5.0 out of 5 stars,WOW! I just used this for the first time on my Instant Pot. I HAVE NEVER BEEN THIS IMPRESSED with an air fryer. First of all it turns your Instant Pot into two appliances. Secondly this is hands down the best air fried food I've ever had. It literally tastes like it just came out of a deep fat fryer without a drop of oil used. Lastly it air fries at Instant Pot speed. Things that used to take 20 minutes or more in my old air fryer are ready to go in about 4 minutes without the funky smell my old air fryer had. I am in love!!!
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is the most amazing kitchen multiuse device I've ever found. I WISH WISH WISH I had found it before our child was born. That would have made cooking with an infant just a matter of throwing everything in and waiting less than an hour.A few of the yums this has already produced:Chili from dry beans and raw meat in under an hour.Carnitas that were some of the most flavorful and juicy I've ever had.Beans that went from dry to ready to eat in 20 minutes!A few notes: while this says it works as a rice cooker, a friend with the same model passed along the note not to use it for that. The seal for the pressure cooker tends to slightly absorb the flavor of the last thing cooked and impart that into your rice. You don't notice in anything else, but rice will taste like the last dish prepared. I haven't used it for yogurt yet, but I'm buying a set of spare seals I can swap when I'm ready to make cheese and yogurt in here."
2.0 out of 5 stars,"UPDATE:They sent me the accessories that were missing. It did take extra days, but they did respond to my request, so raising the rating by one. Rice tasted better when I cooked in greater quantity, but they tend to stick at the bottom even when I mix & move them around on the first opening. It's wasting my rice, so I don't really like that.I just cooked rice in it, and the taste was below expectation, partially because it's my first time cooking in this product and also because the rice tasted too hard on the inside and watery on the outside (I've used 2 other rice cookers in the past, and I read the instructions too). It's just okay, not fantastic.Besides this single experience, which may be updated after trying again later, I want to specify that this DOES NOT come with rice paddle, rice measuring cup, and soup spoon. I have never experienced, shopping on Amazon, a case where a product does not include whatever is in the description. I'm surprised and disappointed cuz it also specifies the same on Instant Pot's website."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"My wife and I have not been all that adventuresome in our cooking...until now.  We bought the DUO80 8 quart Instant Pot a few months ago with some trepidation: would it explode? (no - it's full of safety features that the old pressure cookers our mothers used didn't have.)  Would it produce mushy gray vegetables (no!  At least, not if you use it right).  We had a slow cooker, with which we were pleased, though long hours of cooking didn't suit us. We can still slow cook on this new device.What we love about the Instant Pot is that it's expanded our horizons.  There's a vast assortment of Instant Pot cookbooks available that include all sorts of cuisines - not only plain old pot roast, but boeuf bourguignon and chicken korma and Thai green curry.  Steel cut oatmeal is a (pardon the expression) piece of cake.  Carnitas - spiced pork we put in tacos, is easy and delicious.  Congee, a common dish in Hong Kong, is a natural for an Instant Pot.  We're trying all sorts of dishes we thought were way beyond us. It's been so easy that we no longer shy away from making our own adjustments - a bit more of this, less of that, or different ingredients entirely.  A beautiful gumbo was too hot for us - next time, half the cayenne.  And perhaps we'll substitute crawfish and cajun ham for shrimp and chicken.This has been a terrific addition to our kitchen."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I generally do NOT enjoy cooking, but after using this at my daughters home, I decided this would work for me - its quick, the food tastes great, there are literally millions of recipes on line, and I have even modified some of my own recipes to use in it. The one that I bought can be also used as a slow cooker, a rice cooker, and egg steamer, and several other things (read the product info on Amazon).  I did buy a cookbook, and in it there is a conversion chart for all the foods you might like to cook, and how long they take.  I also know now that this information is also available on line."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Ordered this before Christmas but wasn't able to open the box until after the holidays. The day we were going to use it, we opened it up and to our disappointment there was a huge dent on the outside. I immediately requested an exchange and two days later we had the replacement. They sent me a return code and all i had to do was drop it off at UPS. Done. This was the first time I've returned something on Amazon and it was such an awesome experience. They exchanged it before they even got the product back. As for the product itself, it's very easy to use and the instructions are very clear. The first thing we made was pineapple chicken. With prep time, it took about 30 minutes. The chicken came out tender and juicy. My wife used to use a traditional pressure cooker in the past, and was amazed by how quiet and convenient this was. The inside pot was very easy to clean also, so that's another added plus."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I always loved that I could sear and saute in the instant pot for flavor and texture,  but this air fryer lid crisps like crazy.I made skin on chicken thighs the normal way in the IP , then crisped them with the lid.  Crispy and flavorful and still juicy.Then I made some frozen tater tots in it.  Way better than the oven. Super crisp on the outside, but tender on the inside.I'm really looking forward to more with this air fryer lid."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"We bought this on a whim, and felt we might not use it.  It is now the most used item in the house.  In fact our adult daughter now wants one for her kitchen as well. Its a constant fight over who gets to use it.  I even managed to make awesome grilled cheese sandwiches in it. This is an awesome product."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've made coconut milk yogurt in it, roasts, and chicken for my husband, brown rice, beans, corn on the cob in it.  I love the pot.  It was expensive, but I really love it.  I have cooked in stove top pressure cookers for years.  They are very quick, but you cannot set & forget. The IP gives me that freedom for almost everything I make. It is only 2 of us here at home, but I like to cook and freeze food & to make yogurt in a large container to place in the pot liner, I need room.  I would not have gotten the 6 quart... not at regular price.  I was told that there was a prime day sale that had the 6 quart flying off the shelves.  If I had known that then I would have gotten a 6 quart, but I know that I would not have been happy with that size.  I can always cook less in a big pot; in a smaller pot... you cannot cook more."
1.0 out of 5 stars,"Such a trash. Bought it and only use few times and it can not hold steam anymore and feel like it can be explosive anytime. I emailed instant pot website customer service and no respond. Contact amazon and can only refund me 25%, serious? I rejected the offer, such trash not worth for a dollar."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"The Instant Pot IP-DUO60 7-in-1 Multi-Functional Pressure Cooker is a very good buy.  The multi-function features of the unit make it very useful.  It has a very nice, sharp and clean look.  The stainless steel body looks great.  The control buttons and screen are easy to use.  The heavy-duty 3-ply bottom stainless steel cook pot can be removed and removed for cleaning.  It is dishwasher safe.  The sealing ring can also be removed for cleaning.  The cooker lid removes completely from the unit.There is no non-stick coating on the cook pot.  It is a stainless steel cook pot.  You can order a teflon-coated aluminum cook pot from the manufacturer.  The manufacturer also sells some replacement parts if necessary.You can do so much with the Instant-Pot.  It has a keep warm feature keeping your food warm at a safe temperature for up to 10 hours.  You can make so many things with this unit including soups, stews, chili, rice, steam vegetable and cook meats.  It also makes yogurt.  It is a pressure cooker, slow cooker, steamer and rice cooker combined.It can be a little pricey, but sometimes you can get it on Amazon for a good price.  If you have Amazon Prime, the 2-day Free shipping is nice.I definitely recommend it.  I've had no issues with it.  It works great.  And, it makes good food.  It takes some time to learn the machine if you've never used a machine like this before as a pressure cooker or as a slow-cooker.  After following some recipes that are included, it gets very easy to get creative.  You can get recipes from the other reviewers that have posted.  Or, you can get some recipes from available books for sale or websites that have recipes."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is the best cooking product I've bought to date.  We cook lots of millet and rice and neither sticks to the pan. Cleaning is very quick and easy compared to the old aluminum rice cooker.  We also replaced the west bend coated slow cooker. This cooks more evenly so that the beef consume doesn't get congealed in our soups. The additional glass lid was a good buy as we do a lot of slow cooking and browning for pot roasts.UPDATE 4/5/15: I've emailed support@instantpot.com - ""It worked perfect until about 2 weeks ago (for almost 2 months).  We mainly use it to make 2 cups of millet on multigrain (high pressure) for 12 minutes.  For the past 3 times of making it, the first time I set it, it doesn’t heat up after 30 minutes.  It gets warm but not hot.  I turn it off, and simply reset to the same settings.  It does cook the second time but it takes a long time to heat up.  I am concerned this is a problem that will get worse. At one point when this started happening about 2 weeks ago I was making rice.  It got up to pressure (or was almost there) when I heard it blow and lose all pressure.  I released pressure (there was none), looked in there and the rice wasn’t cooked.  I was able to reset and it cooked out.  The vent handle was set correctly.  I don’t know why it would just go off and release all pressure. I have an extra seal but when comparing, it looks and feels the same. I cleaned the seal and put it back – it was not dirty. I am concerned that I will undercook my slow cooked foods (stews) as this doesn’t seem to know what temperature it needs to get to.""UPDATE 5/6/15: I noticed that the seal tends to stick to the pot lid.  It is clean so I hadn't been cleaning it.  I've now taken one poster's suggestion to heart: clean the seal *every* time.  I've just been getting it wet and moving the seal to make sure there isn't a spot it is sticking.  I then immediately put the lid on and use it before it dries out.  This has worked 100% of the time for the past month (about 10 uses).  I think it was just the seal sticking and not getting cleaned/pulled from the lid (loosened) and wet."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This took a little getting used to and I still keep the 'cheat sheets' handy, but I love it for many reasons.  It eliminates the mess and need to stand over the hot stove.  It is quiet and effective.  I bought an extra internal pot so I wouldn't be without it when one pot was in the dishwasher.  It's a quality product in every way.Like many I remember the trauma of old fashioned pressure cookers and was even afraid to try one of these newer ones for a long time.  Wasted time it turns out.  This unit is very quiet.  It's a 'set it and forget it' type device that beeps when it's done but will keep stuff warm for hours if you're not there to deal if it immediately.  It's important to understand that all the advertising that speaks of brief cooking times never includes the time it takes to build up the pressure to begin with or to release it afterward, so this isn't as fast as they like you to think, but it is faster by half.  Still, that's not really why I bought it.  I bought it because there's virtually no mess and things don't burn, plus the cooking process is out of the way in my small kitchen.I have a ceramic top range that I hate since you can't adjust the heat properly so things burn even though I have nice thick All-Clad pans.  In addition it's awful to clean each and every time I use it as stuff splatters or drips and bakes on.  When I make a big pot of vegetable bean soup on the stove top, it requires frequent attention, stirring and checking, and lots of cleanup afterward.  On the other hand, I can add all the ingredients to the inner pot of this gadget, lock on the lid, push a couple of buttons and walk away.  When it beeps I know it's done, but if I'm in the middle of something, I also know I don't have to go fetch it directly.  Since my kitchen is small and my laundry room is next to it, I put my Instant Pot on my washer and plug it in there.  It's out of the way and yet dinner is ready, my kitchen is clean and I'm in a good mood :).As I said, it does take a bit of fiddling and practice to set it manually.  The buttons work great for particular things, but if you want to do your own thing, you have to get the sequence of setting things right and know what to expect on the display.  There are good instructions and I keep them handy.  I also got the glass lid so I can use the unit as a slow cooker, or to finish off a dish that may need some last minute additions after the pressure cooking phase is complete."
3.0 out of 5 stars,"I have owned this instant pot for over a year now and can give an honest review : it is a good machine to cook with and it does make quick work of many meals, it is however not easy to clean you must remove the rubber seal to clean the lid and after a year the metal bracket holding in the rubber seal is breaking at the spot welded legs.So we have a quality issue with longevity this is why i give it a 3 star review."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This works as expected and better! For over a month, we've successfully made lots of fresh yogurt, steel cut oats, Beef Bourguignon, mashed potatoes, and have had many steaming and sterilization sessions. One thing we've learned is a ""3 minute cook"" is actually a 20 minute process; the cooker needs to heat to the correct temp, then cook, then release pressure. This is our first time with a pressure cooker, so perhaps other users know this process already. But, it's not a complaint of course, just information for a newbie. We've even placed a label maker reminder on the cooker to remind us to ""reset pressure valve"" to keep our learning process smooth.  Overall, it's a great addition to our food prep and goals of eating freshly made meals.  We bought this model because it was highly rated, and deservedly so."
5.0 out of 5 stars,So much nicer than pressure cooking the old fashioned way.  I was a bit hesitant at first because II am home and can simmer my foods for a long time.  The Instant Pot cuts cooking time by more than half and the meats are firm and cooked.  The best part is that it's as tasty as if i slowly cooked it over the stove.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I can't say enough good things about the Instant Pot!  As a pretty serious cook, I was worried that it would only work for me as a pressure cooker for rice, legumes, etc. But I was surprised at how well the saute function works - which is really important to building flavors in soups and stews. I expected to have to brown food in other skillets before adding the food to the instant pot, but I was wrong. It cooks meat to tender perfection in a fraction of the time with all the flavor of the long, slower methods. But the flavor intensity of certain vegetables is actually better than boiling or roasting because of the reduced cooking time, and because you don't have to cut the vegetables (more surfaces = flavor and nutrition loss). For example, whole beets or potatoes (with their skins on) retain much more flavor, because it isn't leaching out into the water or dry oven, and the cooking time is significantly reduced. The beet peels come off in your hands (use paper towels if you are worried about the stain), and mashed potatoes using this method have better texture and flavor. As expected, the IP works really well for soups like split pea or lentil, because you don't have to soak the beans overnight, and you can save money by buying dried rather than canned product. Imagine quickly cooking steel-cut oats for breakfast with no stirring. Finally, Americas Test Kitchen has an excellent pressure cooker cookbook, but you don't really need it because there are tons of youtube recipes and demonstrations that will inspire you! I recommend you buy an extra silicone sealing ring - they do take on the odor of some cooked foods, so you can have a sweet and a savory ring.UPDATE: After 8 months of fairly heavy usage, the saute function on my Instant Pot stopped working (the other functions were still working properly). I contacted the company and after sending them photos of the model and serial numbers on the pot, along with a screen shot of my Amazon purchase in lieu of a receipt, they promptly sent me a new base. I appreciate their excellent customer service."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Had some friends who said I ""just have to get an Instant Pot"".  Christmas of 2017 Amazon had it as a black friday special for about $80 (I think).  So I bought one.  Have made pot roast, pork loin, refried beans, and a couple of other things I don't recall.  All have turned out very well.  The meat is fall apart tender and very moist.  The refried beans take an hour vs all day. There's tons of recipes on youtube.  I was nervous at first about it being a pressure cooker and all the buttons, etc., but it's not that complicated and most of the buttons I've never bothered with, and probably never will.  Great appliance to have in the kitchen."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have had the Instant Pot IP-DUO60 7-in-1 Multi-Functional Pressure Cooker for 15 months now. I admit to not using it but perhaps 3 times a month. I had another brand PC that bit the dust after several years of use. I researched a year before deciding on the Instant Pot. It was a wise decision for me. I am very pleased with the performance of this pressure cooker. I would suggest purchasing a cookbook for electric pressure cookers, as well. I have two and the recipes are made with ingredients one probably has in their pantry. Amazon sells a lot of PC books and the two I like are by Bob Warden. I make chicken gnocchi soup in 6 minutes after the PC comes to pressure (about 15 minutes), as an example. I also cut up potatoes, cover them with water, set time for 1 minute and after PC comes to pressure I do a quick release and they are ready to mash. You can make a fantastic pot roast and veggies in about one hour. There are several Instant Pot facebook groups that are very helpful in tips & tried recipies and of all my cooking groups, I have learned the most, from this community of Instant Pot users. I will never use the yogurt setting but many do and swear it is the best yogurt they have had. A big suggestion if you decide on this PC. ALWAYS be sure your beautiful stainless steel inner pot is IN the PC before you add your ingredients!! So many make the mistake and trust me, you do NOT want to do that. I hope that never happens to me. Some have been able to rescue their IP but others not."

4.0 out of 5 stars,"I've had my air fryer lid for a couple of months and have air fried multiple things beautifully. I loved that it came with a basket with an additional rack so you could air fry 2 racks of things at once - convenient, but honestly a little tricky with figuring out timing; usually the top rack will cook better than bottom rack. The rack is also difficult to pick up if you don't have the correct tool to do so. Probably a small salad tong? Everything cleaned up so easily after use due to the nonstick coating, but eventually I started noticing some chips on the coating/paint especially after one of my uses ended up with burnt food residue stuck on the bottom. Really sad since it works so well otherwise. I love that I didn't have to purchase another large device to air fry stuff, and it comes with bonus features of dehydrating, roasting, etc."
3.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased the Instant Pot at the end of 2017. I used it a few times a year - more heavily in the winter months for soups and braises - and, unfortunately, it has decided to stop working this week, only 2.5 years later. Our family really enjoyed using the Instant Pot. It did speed up cook times significantly, but you need to account for ramp up time (for the machine to come to pressure) - in addition to recipe cook times. Still, hard to argue with saving hours on certain braises. We contacted Instant Brands regarding the lifespan of our machine - we were surprised that it only lasted 2.5 years, given that it wasn't a daily appliance (maybe not even monthly). Would be cautious given the timespan of survival. An initial correspondence from Instant Brand suggested that we buy a new one - but we are currently seeking more information about typical lifespans of these Instant Pots before we purchase a new one."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I already had a 6 quart Nesco electric pressure cooker I have owned for years which still works perfectly; however, I ordered the DUO Plus 60 during the Prime Day sale due to the low price, and to have another one on hand just in case I ever need a backup. In addition, if I ever need to prepare larger quantities, I can use both. That said, I have used it several times now, and works just as good as the Nesco so I can highly recommend this product."

From eggs, to one pot dinners, breakfasts, and gourmet meals, this Pot is the best kitchen investment I've ever made.  I am usually cooking in my Instant Pot 4-5 times a week and my husband, I and our guests are loving the ""gourmet"" creations that come from this spectacular machine!  I truly couldn't be happier that I finally jumped in on the Instant Pot craze!"
1.0 out of 5 stars,It Was Great Until It Tried to Electrocute Me! I used it about 3 times when suddenly an electric charge could be felt when you touch the unit...at 1000 WATTS...not fun. I returned the unit to Amazon. I can see the hype around the Instant Pot-- but be aware of possible electrical issues.I have a Cuisinart 6 quart and Nesco 11 quart I love..and Im considering an 8 quart GOWISE ITS 1300 WATTS and it has a built in digital pressure gauge. The built in digital pressure gauge is beneficial because it allows you to see when the unit comes to pressure and when all of the pressure is released to be able to open the lid. https://www.amazon.com/GoWISE-USA-GW22623-4th-Generation-Electric/dp/B013TBYQ5Q/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1488395879&sr=8-1-spons&keywords=gowise+pressure+cooker&psc=1
5.0 out of 5 stars,This was a gift for someone with a large family. I have the 6 qt and LOVE it. I hesitated getting an Instant Pot. I have a stove top pressure cooker and didn't think this would be so over the top amazing like I have read. I was wrong. This is really awesome. Making yogurt was easy and so so so delicious. Easy to make perfect rice and a great pot for all sorts of cooking. After 2 weeks of use I am still struggling with the cottage cheese recipes but it was still delicious. I like to Control the Ingredients and Quality of Food for my family. The Instant Pot makes it so easy! The must have accessories include Extra Sealing Rings preferably color coded so you can swap them out for cooking stews or yogurt since they do retain odors.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This thing is amazing.  I've done simple things like steamed artichokes, and they took way less time.  I've done a couple recipies that I normally do in the crockpot, and they took just less than an hour under pressure.  But the most impressive? I've heard people saying you can make *quick *flavorful dishes from *frozen meat.  That was the true test...and you know what?  It's true!  I used frozen chicken legs (rock solid) in a recipie for honey teriyaki chicken, and it was done in just under an hour, total time!  Would definitely recommend the Instant Pot."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Got this as an early XMas gift for my mother.  She loves it.  Made pulled BBQ pork this last weekend, it was fantastic.  90 minutes, including prep time and making sides for a meal of BBQ pulled pork.  Actually the pork was done in only an hour.  How can you beat that?  Normally pulled pork takes 6 hours + and this tasted great in just an hour.  Cleans up super easy and most things are one button...cook...eat.  That's it.  Of course you can get fancy if you want, but quick and easy one pot meals is where this thing shines.  Soups, stews...too easy.  Also pork chops, chicken a hundred ways or roasts.  There are literally thousands of recipes online and a vibrant and growing community surrounding this device.  It's easy to set up, use and clean and extremely versatile.  Perfect for people that don't want a fuss or a mess at dinner time.  Also perfect for more experienced cooks that know how to saute, steam, slow cook or make amazing meals in about half the time an oven does (with pressure cooking).  The other thing that impressed was the build quality.  The pot is high quality stainless with a heavy, heat absorbing bottom.  Great for searing (with the saute feature) or keeping things nice and warm till you're ready to eat."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"LOVE, LOVE!  This is actually a gift for my brother.  I bought one for myself a month ago and love it so much I decided to give one to my brother for his 75th birthday.  I bought the 6 quart even though the 3 quart would have been fine for single person cooking but I wanted to cook Pot-In-Pot for smaller portions and I wanted enough room around the inside pot or bowl that I can get it out easily without burning myself.Today I made fall off the bone ribs (see photo)...soooo good.  I placed half rack of ribs in a pyrex bowl inside the pot for easy clean up.  After I let the cook in the pot for 60 minutes I coated them with BBQ sauce placed them in them under the broiler for 7 minutes.  Perfect."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I use this so often and for so many things. The pressure cooking is not intimidating, and despite a rather  brief introduction with the included manual, you can find answers to questions, 1000s of recipes, and great user hints across the internet. It does shorten the cooking process overall, but the best part is leaving it alone while it performs its magic. I am no Julia Child, so the ease and functionality  of this is great. Using the saute function before closing the lid for pressure cooking is a nice one pan feature too. I've never made better hard boiled eggs, but it can do so much more, I've made yogurt. What?!?  easy to clean. Worth the investment!"
4.0 out of 5 stars,"Gently used Pressure Cooker delivers the goods.Have used this model for a little while now and wonder why the hell I didn't buy one earlier.  Making cheap cuts of meat soft and flavorful is something this machine excels at.  I like the ease of operation and safety feature absent on non electric pressure cookers.  At around $100 this preowned wonder pays for itself in time saved.  I don't know what your time is worth but I enjoy being able to have a one pot cooked meal with plenty of flavor in under 30 minutes.Pros- Easy to use interface to input commands- Device will not unlock underpressure, preventing catastrophic accidental openings while under pressure- Easy to clean- Has slow cooker feature which means you can clear more kitchen space.Cons- the steel insert, lining can retain smells so this thing must be thoroughly cleaned after each use- Residual smells can flavor future meals and throw the taste off."

5.0 out of 5 stars,"Ok where to begin!  I was skeptical to spend the money on this thing but I am so glad I did.  It's awesome.  I've used the rice steamer, vegetable streamer, saute, soup, crockpot, pressure cooker.  Steaming vegetables has never been so flavorful!!  I LOVE LOVE LOVE the fact that I can brown my meat in here and then throw in the rest of my ingredients for my slow cooker or pressure cooker recipe.  Now the skin on a pressure cooked chicken doesn't look all that appetizing, but I find that as a bonus simply because I LOVE the chicken skin and we all know its not very healthy.  So this detours me from eating it!  I also love the fact that if I do a slow cooker recipe and if I check it 20 minutes before supper time and its not done (maybe the meat isn't done or the vegis aren't soft enough) then I just throw it on pressure cooker and wam bam thank you, supper has been saved.  I've never used a pressure cooker before buying this.  My ONLY complaint is that it takes a while to pressurize, but I think that is every pressure cooker.  So if I pressure cook something and when its done realize that wasn't quite long enough, then I have to start the whole warming process up.  There is a learning curve.  It does come with a nice manual and recipe book that includes recommended cooking times."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love this pot already and I feel like I haven’t scratched the surface of all the features. Before I bought my pot, I borrowed my son’s large pot to see if I would like using this type of cooker. I really liked it so I bought my own, 3-quart smaller version. So far, the small pot is the right size for me and my husband. There is a learning curve relative to cooking times and methods of operation so it’s a work in progress for me. Pinterest has a wealth of information specific to the 3-quart size as well as numerous recipes, tips and videos."
5.0 out of 5 stars,I have the six and eight quart pots and decided to get this one as well.  I can put an entire frozen chicken in it without having to cut it up.  It also is great when I have lots of people over.  I used it the first day I got it and have used it almost every day since!
5.0 out of 5 stars,"The 8 quart is a _LARGE_ device, be warned.  If I was to re-purchase this, I might get the 6 quart.  That being said, if you are looking to make a lot of yogurt/soup/rice/beans, this is absolutely ideal.  I have had no problems making smaller amounts of these in it yet.I'm on a budget, so originally this was quite an expensive purchase, but since now I can make beans from totally dry in a bag to ready to eat in an hour or so, I've saved a ton of money on food."
1.0 out of 5 stars,I was a big fan of this product had used 3 different ones before. This is the first one that failed on me after 16 months of regular use of the pot. All mechanical parts are working but the electronic panel suddenly failed. Right out of warranty.
2.0 out of 5 stars,"We used instant pot duo mini for 3 years, gentle use. Now it stopped suddenly, and won’t turn on.  It seems like this issue of circuit board is common enough problem.  We contacted the company via email, and at the end of back and forth with many photos sent, they will do nothing.  We also bought extra pot and cover over the years, all these are now useless.  It is unconscionable for a company to make poor product that doesn’t last, they are going to landfill.  It would be simple enough to purchase another electronic item to replace but I will not support this company.  Manufacturing and companies should rethink their marketing model, stop producing products that is built to break.  They should provide support so the broken part can easily be replaced.  Also seeing the photos of the instant pot blowing up, it’s too dangerous. Not recommended"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Easy to use, generous space for food, intuitive functions, wide variety of capability for various foods.  The 8 qt is great for both small and large quantities, and the stainless cooking pot is ideal with its enhanced heat diffusion and reduced tendency for burning contents.  I've made vegetarian and meat dishes with ease, as well as soups and desserts for a few guests as well as a crowd.  Cleanup is easy, food is delicious and quickly available for serving with no noticable added heat to the kitchen during these hot days of summer.  Thanks for a wonderful product!!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've owned a Cooks Essentials pressure cooker for 2 years and have always been disappointed with its performance. The nonstick lining scratched (using only silicone utensils) after only 2 uses. It rattled & sputtered & made me nervous. When I ordered the Instant Pot I was skeptical that it would perform any better than my old one, but boy was I amazed. I carefully read the instruction manual & started by browning a pot roast....it actually BROWNED - and in record time.  I manually set the time for my recipe & then drove myself nuts going to check it every 5 minutes: it was SILENT. Based on my previous experience I worried that it wasn't working.  75 minutes later I did a quick release and threw in the potatoes, carrots & onions. 5 more minutes on high and dinner was ready to go. I'm happy to say it was melt in your mouth tender. I guess that's not news in the pressure cooking world...but here's the best part: the beautiful heavy stainless steel inner pot darn near cleaned itself. A swish with hot water & a really quick wash with dish detergent and it looked like I'd just pulled it out of its shipping container. I'm delighted with this, and can't wait to try the other functions like the rice cooker. I'm certain it's going to be great!Update: last night I made corned beef. My normal m.o. was to simmer it slowly for 3 to 4 hours on the stove top. It usually was good, but I had to baby sit that pot to make sure it was simmering and not boiling - or worse - not simmering at all. After a whopping failure in a slow cooker ( tough as shoe leather & nearly tasteless that went directly into the garbage) I bought the Instant Pot...which really needs a name change to Amazing Pot. Last night's corned beef was the most tender, flavorful perfect we had ever tasted...anywhere. Total thumbs up. My only complaint is that after really careful handling and hand washing & drying the stainless liner I found a small circular 1/8"" hole in the stainless finish on the bottom inside near the side wall of the pot. I'm worried it will grow and become a rust spot and if it's safe to use in the Instant pot. Have posted a question here and will update if I find an answer.11/10/15 Update: I received an answer from Instant Pot...in an INSTANT! They asked for a photo of my little rust spot in the liner, and in less than 10 minutes I got a notice that a new 6qt pot was being shipped to me via FedEx! Now that, dear reader, is customer service! I'm SOooo impressed with this pressure cooker to begin with, and with such excellent customer support, I'm planning to buy an Instant Pot for my sister in law for her birthday."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love this pot and had been using it frequently for 1 1/2 years when it developed a problem with the base in that it wouldn't shut off.  About 2 minutes after sealing, it would start spewing steam and moisture out of the sealing knob because it was getting too hot, so I stopped using it in that dangerous condition.  I was hoping I could maybe get it repaired so contacted the company.  They responded within 24 hours and after answering their questions and sending the pics they requested, I was told they would send me a new base.  Was I surprised that I was sent a whole new unit without charge!  I can't say enough good about the Instant Pot line and the company that not only makes them but stands behind them!  Love this pot!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I absolutely like it. Great product. Easy to cook rice items. However it is taking little bit of time to preheat AUTO mode, then actual time start. This might confuse lot of people. Instructions could be better. I like the built quality of the cooker. Stainless steel is stunning and easy to clean. However, I could cooking marks left after cleaning.I would highly recommend it."
5.0 out of 5 stars,Prepares meals quickly and food comes out delicious!  Follow the directions before you begin your own tweaking of a recipe...I learned the hard way.  Make sure the venting is used properly or you risk burning food.  It is my favorite kitchen small appliance!
4.0 out of 5 stars,I love that this attaches to my existing Instant Pot and that it’s easy to use. My only complaint that it is really large - could buy an entire new air fryer and it’d probably be about the same size! Willing to overlook that because I trust Instant Pot products!
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great combo slow cooker and rattle free pressure cooker. The saute feature allows browning of meats and onion blanching ( I recommend slightly browning onions alone for enhanced flavor most times). Well designed, I have no negatives but be very careful to avoid a steam burn when venting! Steam scalds and burns much faster than hot water due to higher heat value. Use an appropriate hot mitt if venting a full hot pot of food, NEVER overfill and read the manual if you have never used a pressure cooker. You can pressure cook a large hunk of meat, then slow cook it 3 or 4 more hours  with veggies to get a speedier than a crock pot meal with very tender meat such as a pork shoulder roast for pulled pork or a corned beef. Recipes included and many available online seem to miss the utility of this combination. A traditional pressure cooker rattle top need careful adjustment of the heat on a stovetop whereas this cooker does it all automatically. A plus is that extra pan liners and top gaskets are available for purchase. A great kitchen add on, though I prefer a regular rice cooker for plain rice, doing pressurized rice is a waste of effort IMHO."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"My favorite cooking device I’ve ever used! I love it so much I cried when my 6qt fell on the floor & shattered the base. Then when I replaced it w/ the 8qt The lid fell to the ground & busted the handle!!!!! Whyyyyyyyy!!! It still works & I use it all the time. I just taped up the handle & it’s barely noticeable that I totally suck at taking care of my beloved cooker.I use it 3-6 times a week. I love that I can throw something in, not worry about it, & dinner is pretty much done in under an hour."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This particular brand and model number was recommended to us by a friend. We have been pleasantly surprised with the ease and functionality of this combined electric pressure cooker and slow cooker. It makes rice incredibly easy and well. Meats come out tender, moist, and flavorful. (take care not to overcook). We like the ability to sear meat and onions together with it open, stirring, before adding liquid and closing to pressure cook. The inside pot washes up easily and quickly. The instruction booklet is easy to understand. The safety features seem solid, easy to understand, and workable. We like the feature that allows us to set the timer and let the meal start cooking even while we're busy or away. We've found many pressure cooker recipes online that we've tried. Have discovered many options and flexibility with this new cooker. Highly recommend this Instant Pot!"
1.0 out of 5 stars,"I only use this instant pot 8 times! No kidding. And believe me I’m known for taking really good care of my electronics and smart devices. Everything was great at the beginning, the meals I cooked there turned out great! By the ninth use this sign came on “C1 error” and wouldn’t go away , I tried to connect and disconnect several times , I tried use it the next day it was the same, I wouldn’t put any weight  in the pot , same result “C1 error “ if I want to fix it it would cost more than buying a new one, not worth it. Based on my experience I wouldn’t recommend anyone to buy this item. Very bad design."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I use my Instapot for many things. I use it at least twice a week. it is easy to use and clean. I came with a handy card that tells you long to cook stuff. It makes the most perfect 2-minute eggs. Delish. If you are thinking about getting one, this is a good size for a small family."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"this fancy machine makes it easier to feed myself :). I've used it to cook rice, curry, and potatoes and it's been great. I overdid the volume of my curry once and it burnt in the pressure cooker, which was not afraid to let me know by beeping constantly, but that was my fault for not paying attention to the markings on the cooker."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is not your ordinary rice cooker or crock pot. There are some serious safety procedures that are mentioned in the instructions that need to be followed, otherwise you could get burned or worse, so please read the whole instruction book. With that being said we found a chili verde recipe that came out fantastic in only 25 minutes. There are cookbooks and recipes specifically for this type of item and if your life is as busy as ours you will definitely find it useful. It’s also very easy to clean, but does take up some counter space. All in all a great product."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love my IP! Got it last month as an early Christmas present because I desperately needed something to make cooking regularly easier on me due to health/pregnancy making things more difficult for me.I love that I can just throw ingredients (INCLUDING FROZEN MEAT) in there, set it, and walk away without having to worry about it. I can even go run errands and take a nap and be busy/away longer than expected, and it will just finish cooking then keep my food warm for me, and I will come back to perfectly cooked food.And most things cook way faster too! So even if I'm having a bad day, I forget to pull meat to thaw, etc, I can still finish cooking a meal (from taking the meat out of the freezer to the food being completely done) in LESS THAN AN HOUR.I have literally zero problems with my IP, and I use it as often as I can. I even started making homemade yogurt because of it!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love my instant pot. I think it should be noted that it takes quite a while to come to pressure before it starts cooking. So, sure, it COOKS chicken in under 20 minutes, but that's after a good 20 to 30 minutes of waiting for the IP to start actually cooking. It doesn't always save time but it does save effort. Great for someone like me who can't cook well. No guesswork. Just set it and I know my food will not be under or over done!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"The 8 quart was to big to use outside of canning and family holidays.  This earns its space on my counter full-time.  More than the mixer, more than the microwave. --I even gave away the microwave and got better food.  For the price, I think it should have came with a basket.  Buy a basket, it increases usefulness by 10."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Incredible! So, so, so happy with this! Can’t believe how much easier and faster it is to make dinner and large batches of anything! Kind of blowing my mind what this Instant Pot can do. I just YouTube how-to videos for recipes. So incredibly easy and fast! Great safety features. We got the 8-qt. Absolutely love it!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Amazing. I felt intimidated by it. Which to buy and how to use. I was wrong, it’s simple a great. Tons of recipes on the internet or FB groups. I recommend the duo. 6 QT for a small to medium size family. I went 8 QT because I have 3 kids and 2 will be teenage boys at some point."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"As an avid meal prepper who often goes through cycles where you just want something that tastes amazing & is flavorful and opts to live off Trader Joe’s, this device has single handled solved the problem of buying anything processed since it tastes just as good in your home for minutes!! Im the only seafood eater in my home as well, and I can now go to the farmers market each week and pick up 1 piece of something for me and make an entire meal for my family in the pot in under and hour, dishes washed and everything prepped. I’ve recommended this to everyone I know. It’s so easy and it takes the place of so many kitchen appliances you already probably have taking space."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"After using one of these I will never own a crock pot again, its versatility is fantastic and has allowed us to cook more foods that we didn't have the ability to cook before.  My favorite thing hands down is how tender it makes meats, my partner and I make a simple but wonderful chicken teriyaki and the chicken will literally fall apart as we are serving it.  That said it is a complex machine and we have had to learn it's intricacies (not the fault of the manufacturer) so if you expect to make the best meal you have ever had in it the first time you use it, you may be mistaken as it will take time to learn what works best for you.  This version makes enough food for 4-8 servings and it's versatility allows us to at times to have this machine as the only thing we cook out of for days at a time.  Due to its versatility, I feel this product is useful in any household and if you need to cook more food (say for a family of 5+ just get a bigger version of this)"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love my instant pot.  This larger size has been great to accommodate larger meals.  I cook a lot, and have run out of room for anything but a necessity in my kitchen, and for me, this pot is a necessity."
2.0 out of 5 stars,We have had this product for less than a month and used it maybe a handful of times and it’s already not working properly. Contacted the manufacturer and even though we paid extra warranty the company itself is not backing up the product and making a list of demands before they can return/replace it. Not happy with my purchase or the way they handle their customers. I do not recommend this product.
5.0 out of 5 stars,Okay so I am in LOVE!  I have never had a pressure cooker and kept hearing how awesome they were.  I already have several crock pots so thought it was similar.  SOOOO different.  I really love the way the pulled pork came out.  I have made it numerous times in the crock pot and it was much stringier and many times too dry.  This came out perfect.I also made boneless beef ribs.  I love the way the fat emulsifies and you can then use it for gravies or to make sauces etc.  The flavor was intanct not bland or boiled tasting like sometimes happens in a pressure cooker.My warning is that I have now joined numerous facebook instant pot groups and there are so many cool items that can go with this that I now think I need!
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I LOVE this product. It was a bit of a learning curve to figure out how long to cook soaked beans, as every type has different cooking time. Also depends if you are cooking them for salad or stew/refried beans. I love that the Instantpot does not generate a lot of heat (on auto release of steam) and great for cooking in hot summers, compared to all the heat given out by stovetop cooking. I love not having to worry about the foam running off. Also, I make broth from kitchen scraps. If not for Instantpot, I would not bother with it, and just buy packaged broth. Now I can save money and create less packaging waste. I love making stews/other one pot recipes, and with a sautee function, it is really easy. I have always been hesitant to get a pressure cooker due to safety concerns. But there is no way to get it wrong! :) The machine will tell you. It's easy to clean and operate. No idea how I lived without it before!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Got this as a gift for someone, and they love it. She’s not too confident in her tech skills, so I gave her a hands-on tutorial, and it was so easy to use that she was ready to go before I’d even finished. Before using it, she must have asked me at least 4xs if she had to precook chicken before making fried chicken. She didn’t believe me that it would cook and fry for that short period of time. She could not believe that it worked so well! She loves the range of food that she can make with it and says it all turns out so delicious! And it’s so fast, too! Great value, as well... we love it!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm very pleased with the quality and performance of this product.  I am also amazed at all the EASY recipes that are available for instant pot cooking!  The best thing about this is how tender, juicy and quick you can cook meats with an instant pot.  It is also very easy to clean after use as the insert is stainless steel and washes great in the dishwasher.  The lid gets moist with the steam as it is released after the cooking cycle, and wipes clean very easily using a vinegar-moistened paper towel, followed by a dry one."
5.0 out of 5 stars,Beginner's luck in that the first Roast and vegetable dish went perfectly.  The second meal using a sauce from William Sonoma needed to be finished in a pan because the Instant Pot issued a Burn warning with the 5 beeps  - still delicious when done - conclusion - not enough liquid.  Third dish was also a William Sonoma sauce and I added water and all went well with the Pressure Cooking but there was too much water so had to boil down to get back to the sauce.  I'll keep working on it!
2.0 out of 5 stars,"My mother use to cook great food in a stove top pressure cooker. Although this unit has many features,  I'm not very happy with it. To start with it's  not really much faster. First thing is it has to reach full pressure which is around 10min. Then the cook time, then depressurize.  In all, not much faster.  I didn't like the rice cooked under pressure compared to cooked in a rice cooker or a pot on the stove.All in all...another gadget to take up kitchen space or sit getting dusty in the cabnet.No...I pass on this...waste of money."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm still scared of it and prefer the rice cooker and crock pot to using this thing. Slow cooked ribs stuck to the bottom and not as juicy or delicious as slow cooking in a ceramic crock pot.  Best I can say about it is it's an electric pressure cooker with a timer on it, which is safer and more advanced from the old stove top model."
5.0 out of 5 stars,I'm so thankful I found a great deal on this for cyber Monday last year! I'm a forgetful girl...now I don't have to remember to soak beans! I can have them ready in just 45 minutes! If I forget to thaw out meat for dinner then I can still get it done within an hour. I was going to purchase a bigger rice cooker but with this I don't have too. I can make up to 12 cups or maybe more of rice!! I don't do all that fancy stuff others do but I have used the crap out of it with just these 3 basics. Oh and I make my own yogurt sometimes. It's nice!! It's not scary either...just get one and try it!
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I'd been eyeing an Instant Pot for over a year before I pulled the trigger, and by the time I did I had already joined a bunch of groups and communities dedicated to sharing photos and recipes of what my new kitchen gadget was capable of. I've used it at least once a week every week since purchasing it, well over 50 meals by now. I can count on one hand the number of botched or ruined attempts, and they were all due to less-than-ideal circumstances; I learned a nuance of pressure cooking or tried recipes that were unsuited for the Instant Pot. I feel very confident in my pressure cooking abilities now and love the safety that modernization and technology have brought to something that was traditionally very intimidating.My small and only complaint is that I purchased it thinking I would cook rice in it regularly. While it does cook rice adequately (once you get the water amount down, hint: less than you'd traditionally use because no water escapes), it is not as good/fast as an appliance dedicated to the task, and it's very difficult to make an Instant Pot meal that's served with rice when you need the Instant Pot to also make the rice.."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is the BEST investment I've ever made. I LOVE making soups and this goes from frozen chicken parts to homemade chicken noodle soup in 40 minutes. I had an old fashioned pressure cooker with the jiggly piece on the top. This is SO. MUCH. BETTER. I used it all last winter for soups, stews and misc. meals. I love that you can saute in it and then switch to pressure cooker or slow cooker. This winter I'm going to see if there's anything it CAN'T cook. I made many wonderful things...including a crusty pudding dessert with apples. YUM!  LOVE. LOVE. LOVE this Instant Pot. Just the right size for me......makes enough meals for me for a week. And they're really healthy and my own good ingredients."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"If I could give this ten stars I would.......I've owned two other electric pressure cookers, that just didn't hold up.  This brand is almost indestructible.  The stem is recessed with a much thicker gauge of metal than my previous cookers.  The lid is fully removable along with the pressure release valve making it easier to clean any  spills or liquid that may have found their way through the vent. While the multiple buttons look intimidating, the process couldn't be easier with the excellent user manual. The stainless steel bowl is a breeze to clean. I've never had anything get stuck on the bottom that couldn't easily be scrubbed off.  The heat is evenly distributed and everything is cooked to perfection in a very short amount of time. If you're looking for a cookbook to go with your pressure cooker, make sure it's ""Great Foods Fast"" by Bob Warren, it's by far my favorite pressure cooker cookbook, it's chalk full of fantastic recipes!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,I was debating about 3Qt size but I wanted something not so big that it intimidates me to cook / clean everyday. I use my pressure cooker everyday and when it finally broke I was too nervous to buy something fancy like this. But I am beyond happy as it has become an integral part of my kitchen in 2 weeks. I pressure cook everyday in this and also best yogurt maker.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I just love the instant pot! I do a lot of cooking. It’s so easy to make anything and everything and all the dishes turn out sooo good. I have made a a lot of indian dishes like Rajma, Chole, shahi paneer, dals, rice kheer, Palak paneer, Pav bhaji, sambhar and also pasta, minestrone soup, spinach soup, tortilla soup and many other dishes! What I love is that this is a one pot cooking. You can saute things, put the spices and herbs, close the lid, set the time and walk away!!! I would like to add that it’s not that instant though. Even though you set the timer for 10 minutes but it takes time for pressure to build and the pressure to release after the cook time is over."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have been using a stove top pressure cooker for years, but this Instant Pot is way better. It automatically takes care of heat and time at pressure. Plus, this one has settings for yogurt, rice, steaming, slow cooking and pressure cooking. It's quiet and easy to use and to clean. Nice heavy removable stainless inner pot - no non-stick coating."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This thing is onebof the best pressure cookers on the market by far. We have made pot roast, soups, tea, yogurt and a bunch of other things in it. And never once did anything come out bad at all.. The insert is dishwasher safe and the lid is a breeze to hand wash or top rack in the dishwasher. .. It does take up a little space on the counter. but What kitchen equipment doesn't right.. If you like using pressure cookers you'll love this on"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Very simple to use and amazing! It comes with a nice manual, but it was all warped and difficult to use.  Otherwise, perfection! Love the design. I thought it would be difficult to learn how to use it, but it is really simple! Definitely a staple in my kitchen. Unbelievable stew in under an hour ( 33 minutes and another twenty or so to heat up and cool down). I find the food tastes better in this rather than a slow cooker. Easy to saute in the same pan and then turn to pressure cook.  I found the online price at 49 with free shipping for the 6 quart a great bargain."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Been breaking in my new instant pot mini & absolutely love it! After much research for recipes specific to the mini, I learned you can use any 6 quart recipe for the mini by cutting it in half or just not using as much meat. It’s quickly being incorporated into our weekly meals made easy! Perfect for 2 ppl too!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,Very handy. There are only 2 of us and it helps with portion control but does cook for mor if needed. I’ve given away my 2 large pressure cooker and happily replaced them with this pot. You can do many things with it. I like to not dirty dishes. There are a lot of recipes for this. I can sauté to start add food and use the other settings to finish the meal. The only problem I have is that I haven’t been able to attach the drip cup.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I am beyond pleased with this product. I loved the fact that it makes a gentle beeping sound to let you know that the lid is locked or being unlocked. I love that I can adjust the timing up or down for a meat or soup dish. For instance I made a pork and rice dish that I adjusted from the 30 minute to 45 minute cooking time. The programming is significantly better than the Power XL that I had to discard when I could no longer get the lid off even after replacing parts. I feel safe with this unit and so will you. I am now a seasoned user of Pressure Cooking, but was a scared beginner. Don't be! Start off with a pot of soup. Just don't overfill the pot, leave room for the steam. Throw all your ingredients in at the same time. It's magic. I use frozen, yes frozen chicken pieces, frozen soup vegetables, chicken stock, onions, celery, and extra wide noodles. I swear ladies, it's the easiest cooking lesson in the world and you'll get braver, I know I did!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Can't live without it!  I've actually taken mine to our business so I can whip up a quick home-cooked meal there rather than eating fast food. The ability to saute, slow cook, pressure cook...it's just amazing. I am considering buying another to have at home rather than transporting back and forth.  A great product and once you get onto using it you'll very soon have favorite recipes you'll want to make regularly.  It's so fun, too, to check out recipe ideas on Pinterest.  I sometimes lose track of time and can sit for quite a while searching for great things to make!  You won't be disappointed."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love mine.Baby back ribs yesterday when my son and my daughter-in-law came to visit for Mother's Day. 30 minutes and a quick finish in BBQ sauce in the oven and BAM...fall off the bone goodness.We've cooked egg bites, soup, stew, indian dishes, beans, baked beans, pulled pork, all kinds of recipes. Most were great. A few were shoveled into the garbage can - not the Instapot's problem - they were just bad recipes. But, HEY! With the Instapot, you can make something else pretty quickly.This is one of the best buys we've made. It gets used often. It's a solid performer, well built, easy to use and easy to clean."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Every single thing I've prepared in this Instant Pot has come out well.  I have been retired for almost 20 years and rarely cook any longer.  But since I've gotten the Instant Pot 6 qt everything has been super easy, fast, and tastes really great.  And its versatility means I can cook just about anything.The only thing I'm not pleased with is the short cord.  It barely reaches the outlet so I have to turn it so the display faces away from me. Even though the directions warn against it, I'm seriously thinking about using a surge protector just to get an extra foot of additional length."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This pressure cooker has really been amazing. I did not expect this *at all*. I bought this as a gift for my wife, who talked to a friend that had a previous model from this brand. At this point, I think we've used each of the major features:1. Pressure Cooking: Very easy to use, and extremely effective. You cannot tell that the meat/whatever has not been in the slow cooker all day.2. Slow Cooker: Great. Each time our meals come out tasting distinct (with our previous slow cooker, somehow everything tasted the same...)3. Yogurt Maker: This makes making yogurt very easy and reliable. I've made this twice now, and I've had success both times.4. Saute: Terrific. Many slow cooker recipes call for a quick cook on the meat to create a crust. This can be done in the pressure cooker, which makes these truly one pot meals.The only thing we haven't used this for is rice, which probably works well, given how everything else has turned out. The inner pot is easy to clean (we've only hand washed), and the outer pot never gets dirty. The only thing we'd want at this point is maybe another inner pot."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"One of the best things I've purchased ever hands down. I hate cooking, this makes cooking stuff really easy. I use it daily probably 3 or 4x a day, I boil eggs in it, i cook my potatoes in there, then i cook any chicken or seafood. I can put frozen chicken or frozen shrimp in there and timer only needs to be at 10 min. Only thing you need to buy is a different strainer for cooking in it, the one it comes with doesn't do it, but they are cheap on here.I just throw chicken in it, close thelid, and walk away. Then come back when done. I will never be without one of these again lol."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This was a gift to my better half, but it turned out to be a great gift for myself. Since I gifted this for Christmas I had a ton of great home cooked meals. I don’t know if it came from recipes, inspiration, creativity or just being an excellent cook and I don’t really care. If this thing should ever break I will have an order placed within minutes. I’ve never used it myself, but it makes my girl happy and obviously it makes me happy as well. Thumbs up for the Instant Pot"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Got this for my mom for Mother’s Day, per her request! She loves it! I have the same one and so easy to use! One of the best appliances you have to have in your home! I’ve been preparing dishes I’ve never thought I could with the instant pot! Worth every penny! If it’s in your budget don’t settle for the generic competition, instant pot is like no other!"
3.0 out of 5 stars,"People tell me that this machine is wonderful, but I have yet to experience that. Why not? Because I don’t know how to use it. Why not? Because the instructions are crap. Is it too much to ask for a nice little book of instructions? The instructions that come with the machine direct me to an online website, but those instructions are not for this machine. Furthermore, they are all videos. Now, there is a place for videos in this world, but I prefer written instructions."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I don't know why I waited so long to buy an Instant Pot; I guess I was intimidated by the idea of cooking with one (I've used a pressure cooker for canning, but that's a different ballgame).  I love this thing, and have gotten the hang of it pretty quickly.  I love that I can make a whole meal in one pot with just 1-3 steps, depending on what I'm making and how much effort I'm willing to put into it.  Easy to use (follow the directions!!!!) and easy to clean.  I also really like that there are so many accessories available, though I wish IP itself would put out OEM versions of more of them."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I use my instant pot regularly, I really like it and have recommended it to various family members. It does take prep to make any meal whether cooking with the instant pot or not, yet being able to cook meals in short time is the best!!  Making bone broth in a few hours, instead of days, is fantastic!  Although it has many functions, if used as a pressure cooker there are some safety precautions one must exercise. I intend to use every function on this appliance and I am hopeful it works for a very long time."
2.0 out of 5 stars,After reading many reviews for the air fryer lid I ordered it.I don't think I've ever been so disappointed in a kitchen appliance.It arrived this afternoon. I already had chicken wings out to cook.The wings I have are pretty smallish and I could only fit 7 per layer. Used the tray that came with it to make 2 layers of wings.Started cooking. 12 minutes first round then you have to turn the wings over.Opened the lid and was very happy. The wings were browning up quite nicely. Took them out so I could remove the tray (there's no way to get the tray out without taking the food off) and was dismayed that the bottom layer of wings were not brown in the least little bit. I guess that makes sense since the top layer would block some of the air flow.But that means that you would be limited to cooking whatever fits in the small area of the pot or tray.It takes 12 minute per side to cook the wings so to feed myself and my wife 14 wings would take 48 minutes plus the time it takes to turn the wings and load another batch.Needless to say this is going back to Amazon. Perhaps I'll try a regular 8 qt. air fryer instead.a
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I thoroughly enjoy my Instant Pot. I'm learning how to cook. For the first time in my cooking life, made chicken and dumplings! I have online recipes, video s. I can prepare a complete nutritious meal in one pot. I am thrilled at every piece of my tool set. I purchased two. One goes to my daughter in law for a Christmas gift. She recommended the Instant Pot. The price is wow!!. A bargain.thank you and be blessed.  Dana Coates"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"As I sit here at work eating my leftover Mongolian Beef and Broccoli made yesterday in my Instant Pot, dreaming about the steamed artichoke I made in 15 minutes last night to go with it in my Instant Pot, and excited about the Chicken and Dumplings my husband made in the beloved IP a few days ago, I realize this is the first time in 5 years I have actually cooked dinner more than 2 x in a week!  No processed quick foods for us.  Just healthy delicious meat and veggies, prepared fast in the IP after work and before the kids go completely crazy from lack of sustenance.  There are so many options for recipes, and you can even make cheesecake and quick steel cut oatmeal.  All in record time, all made from scratch.  Absolutely life changing kitchen appliance for busy families.  Highly recommended!  It's not that hard to figure out...from someone who hasn't cooked much prior to this lovely pot..."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I was born and raised in Pennsylvania where we have quite a few crockpots recipes, first one I did in this was ham and string beans which only took 30 minutes to cook and tasted just like I had it in a crockpot for hours.  Today I did the traditional pork and sauerkraut for new years and I used the sautée to brown the pork then cooked it with kraut for 60 minutes.  All I can say is wow.... didn't need a knife to cut the pork, just comes apart and tastes like it cooked for hours.  I am looking forward to more meals in the future in this thing, would highly recommend to anyone.  I will be buying this as presents for family and friends, something they will be thanking me for for years to come."
5.0 out of 5 stars,Really love this but probably should have selected the 6 qt as most recipes are written for that. Will probably buy a 6 qt one and keep both.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"5months into purchase:I have never cooked in my life and started only this July - Instant pot is amazing cos its easier to cook , clean and I dont have to be there all the time. I cook Indian food mostly - it is easy to saute and pressure cook without changing the vessel. Cleaning is easy as it is only one bowel . Great for making curry and biryani. I have also cooked eggs, veggies and stuff - it works well. The best part is you can set the timer and do your other chores when it cooks - JUST WATCH OUT FOR BURN IF YOU HAVE LESS OIL OR WATER.Highly recommended for single males. There are many online blogs with a ton of recipes to try with this."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have a slew of kitchen gadgets, and this is probably the best thing I have ever bought. The ability to cook roasts and rice and beans and potatoes and all sorts of stuff super fast has made it a lot easier to consistently make dinner and to eat healthier. I suffer from frequent depression and this machine has eliminated the days where I felt like I had no time to make a decent meal.So far my favorite thing is how easy it makes bone broth. The stainless steel bowl has very clearly marked indentations showing how much liquid is in the bowl. I like to reduce my broth down to be frozen in ice cube trays such that one cube can be reconstituted with one cup of water. Using the sautee function, I reduced 9 cups of broth down to 1 cup and that was the ratio needed. I suck with spatial stuff so not having to eyeball it was great.The broth made in the Instant Pot lacks the slightly burnt taste the crock pot always produces for me, too.I haven't tried making cheesecake in it yet, but I will."
1.0 out of 5 stars,I’m giving this a one star because it doesn’t work. Even after cooking things twice as long as required they’re still not done. For example steamed potatoes. My two russet potatoes were only half baked after I sent them through the entire cycle twice. I didn’t get a chance to use my pot when I first arrived and now I’m past the return date. I will be reaching out to Amazon and to the company to see what I can doAnd I will update this review
5.0 out of 5 stars,"The air fryer lid works great, better than expected, and made delicious sweet potato fries with only a touch of oil. I only wish they included recipes or cook times. It's hard to find recipes on the internet for this product in particular and I had to resort to watching YouTube videos."
5.0 out of 5 stars,Love my instant pot. Use it alot for different things I would suggest buying additional seal rings and some steam baskets.
4.0 out of 5 stars,"I made my first dish yesterday and it was a no brainer.  The instructions are clear and the recipe book is indispensible.Update 12/28/2018: the Instant Pot Mini seems to start pressure cooking rice even when the lid is in open position and unlocked. I think this is a big problem! There should be an audible or visible warning to announce to the user that the lid is not locked and the device should not start the preset “rice” pressure cooker mode. These features are available on washing machines and refrigerators, etc."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I came to look at the larger Instant Pot and, as I always do, glanced at the negative reviews first. I was surprised that there were any, to be honest. And what I have read just doesn't reflect my experience. I assume everyone is being honest, so there must be an occasional quality control problem, but I suspect from what I have heard from people I know that my experience is more nearly the norm.My son is in grad school, and he has been using his Instant Pot I would guess 5-6 days a week for 14 months. I use it more than that when I visit him, which is frequently, and when he comes home on breaks.In my experience with the 6 qt. Duo, the pressure indicator works fine. The Pot gets hot like it's supposed to, and it does the same thing for the same dish every time. It is used primarily for rice, vegetable stew and soup, vegetarian chili mac, and dried beans. My only complaint is that I would design the saute' function to be not quite as hot because you have to stand over it stirring the whole time, and I would rather take a little longer and be able to turn away for 30 seconds to do something else. That said, the saute' function works perfectly as long as you know this, and I won't take a whole star away from my rating because of this. The pre-programmed buttons work perfectly and consistently, the stainless steel liner is very easy to clean, and the appliance is a complete winner in my book!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,Inner pot is metal so food doesn’t taste like plastic. Quick heat up and shorter time than oven. Clear instructions. Nice accessories and hot pad to rest the unit on while flipping the food (which doubles as a base/lid) crisps food fantastically easy display read
5.0 out of 5 stars,"After tons of research and lots of time, I finally broke down and gave in to the Instant Pot craze. I bought 2 of these (one for myself and one for my mom). I am a sucker for my kitchen gadgets and I am in LOVE with it. It cuts cooking time down drastically with fantastic results. There is definitely a learning curve to using it (so far I haven't explored all the settings, just the manual and egg modes) but I am excited to keep trying new things in it. Currently my 2nd favorite appliance (after my Kitchenaid Mixer). If you are hesitant like I was, go for it! So worth it, and now I wish I would have purchased one sooner."
3.0 out of 5 stars,Was delivered timely.  Took a total of 23 minutes before was ready to start cooking so I'm not sure how much time this will save.  Don't know if this one is defective or not.Here's what happened during the Initial Test Run noted on page 17:  I used cool (not cold) water.  The top switch was set to Sealing.Manual says: Within a few minutes steam will start coming out for a minute or two until the Flat Valve pops......  Actually took 16 minutes for any steam to come out.  Steam then came out for 3 1/2 minutes until the  Float Valve popped up.Manual says: Within another minute or two the working pressure will be reached and countdown timer will begin.... Actually took 4 minutes before the countdown timer started.I will update the review after I've cooked a few meals.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I wasn't crazy about this purchase, but my (young adult) daughter has used it one or twice a week since we got.  She makes wonderful soups, and says that the pot makes it much easier and faster.  It's easy to use, and easy to clean.  Now I'm very happy with this pot!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Absolutely love this pressure cooker.  I have several that are stove top and was ready to try electric.  It can be a little fussy with getting up to pressure sometimes but for the most part, it does a great job.  The programming could be easier.  I have to keep the directions handy as you can get a little lost along the way.  Most things are best done manually.  The preprogrammed settings seem to overcook a bit.  If you love pressure cooking as I do, this is a great addition.  Easy to clean and a great size for a smaller family but enough for leftovers.  I ordered another electric one from one of the TV retailers and it was huge.  This has a relatively small footprint so I don't mind leaving it out next to food procesor. Have not used the rice cooker or slow cooker options.  Buy an extra ring.  All pressure cooker rings get a bit smelly from absorbing food odors.  If you rotate them they stay a bit nicer smelling."
3.0 out of 5 stars,"I’m loving my 8qt IP so much, that I decided we needed a mini for yogurt, sides, and desserts. I’ve had it a grand total of two hours and so far I’m pleased with the machine itself. However, Amazon said this refurbished machine would arrive with all parts but might not have the manual. Fine; I have the 8qt’s manual. It arrived today— with the manual— but with a condensation collector that won’t fit on the 3 qt (looks to be for the 8 qt), and without the steam rack/trivet. I contacted customer support who shrugged and offered a return— no exchange. I’m annoyed. I’m going to try to make it work and see if I can pick up the missing parts elsewhere (no idea where to look that won’t have me paying what I saved buying it refurbished). Wish me luck, I guess, because Amazon could care less!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've never owned a pressure cooker before, so I wasn't sure what to expect from this.  Truly, I thought the claims about being able to cook dried beans in under an hour was an exaggeration, but I figured I'd give it a shot.  Then I tried, and it really does!  The one thing you need to keep in mind about the stated cook times is that it's only the cook times.  It does not factor the time it takes to build up enough pressure for the lid to seal and the pressure cooking to begin.  It also does not factor in the time for the pressure to naturally release.  So, even if it says something takes 20 minutes, it's probably actually more like 45-60 minutes (if you let the pressure release naturally, but it could be more like 30-40 minutes if you quick release the pressure).The panel is super easy to use, and I've taken this with us camping since we are vegetarians and therefore don't grill.  This truly is a fabulous appliance!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I was a doubter at first. Seemed like a new fad. Full disclosure, I used to use a regular pressure cooker so I understood what one does.Now that i have used mine for a few months, it amazes me!  I can start dinner in the morning, work out in the home, shower, and when I’m leaving it is coming down from pressure. Family can eat the dinner that has been warming all day!I do think there are appropriate dishes for it and also you have to understand that it helps because you don’t have to watch the pressure cooker."
5.0 out of 5 stars,Item arrived undamaged and is the perfect size. It works great
5.0 out of 5 stars,"One of my best purchases ever!  Don’t listen to the bad reviews. This works like a charm. Really crisps things up!  I threw a whole bag of frozen French fries in and air fried them, turning every so often. You would think they came out of the deep fryer. I did notice a little chipping on the surface of the fry basket. I’m going to contact the company about this."
1.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought this and it was delivered on April 29, 2020.  Today, July 3. 2020, with guests for dinner, it does not work.  This is appalling.  I am disgusted.  This less than one star."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"The Instant Pot can’t replace all your kitchen appliances as some would claim. However, I do love mine and find myself using one of the three I own a few times a week. We have certain dishes that we much prefer the results from the instant pot - carnitas, pulled pork, ribs, pot roast, Mac n cheese, and a few others."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"So I was a tiny bit hesitant to buy this because of some negative reviews I saw but I am so glad I did!Buy this if:You love (or hate) to cook and want something that will speed you through the process; are likely to forget to defrost meat for meals; like using fewer pots for cooking;Are super busy and need a healthy meal fastSome major bonus points:Can cook from frozen. YES! I didn't believe it but I tried it twice. I've noticed that I don't need to add cooking time manually when working from frozen; the pressurizing takes longer for frozen foods and the cook time starts after adequate pressure is reached. I'm guessing different recipes may vary, but I made chicken bolognese from frozen ground chicken breast(in my deep freezer for over a month) in about 45-60 minutes. I also cooked frozen thighs and drumsticks in about 30ish minutes.Built in downtime for me once the pot is set means I can clean up, set the table, etc. without running back and for to check the meal.It has a delay function (haven't tried, but I can't wait to!)Can be used with or without pressure (so it can double as a slow cooker)Has an excellent saute functionControls are pretty intuitiveGood size (6qt looks like it could fit a small whole chicken if I wanted) but they make larger ones too.Seems to have excellent safety features to minimize the risk of exploding the lid (which was sometimes a thing with old pressure cookers)Downside:The steam vent is a bit weird; took me a couple of minutes to figure it out. Also, when you do quick release you have to hold it in position which is annoying (I think someone sells a little steam vent that takes care of this but I haven't purchased it). Also, either use a utensil to hold the release position or where a cooking glove/towel because the steam sometimes sputters a little. Honestly,  though, this is such a small issue that the fact that I can come home after 8pm and still have a hot, fresh meal ready by 9ish FAR outweighs it.Oh! And if you are not into ""one pot"" meals where everything is together (stews, chili, etc) they make accessories so you can make separate sides too!"
4.0 out of 5 stars,"Pros: This has quickly become a workhorse appliance, and I use it almost every dayCons: Not particularly attractiveAbsolutely horrible instructionsNow that I have gotten over the learning curve, I use my Instant Pot almost daily, and it has changed the way I eat, for the better. Recent items include soup, yogurt, steel cut oats, and hard boiled eggs.About that learning curve. The set up instructions were unclear and referenced parts that didn’t even come with my pot. I finally turned to google and Youtube to guide me through set up, testing, and use.The pot is useful enough to leave out on the counter, so I wish it were a bit snazzier, with more options for color and design. A great appliance if you can get past the hurdle of the very poor instructions."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I eat a lot of rice and beans...dried beans that take forever to cook, and have to be stirred and watched so they don't boil over.  I normally soak them over night, and the last few time I put them in the crockpot because it seemed easier, but it took like 10 hours for them to get soft, and they turned out all faded in color, and not very tasty looking.  I did a little research, and read that using a pressure cooker can solve those problems, so I invested in the Instant Pot IP-DUO60.  I just got it, and here's how the beans turned out.  All I did was rinse the beans and put them in the Instant Pot with a couple cups of water, a ham bone and some seasoning.  I put it on the Chili/Bean setting and set it for 30 minutes.  And by gosh, the beans were DONE in 30 minutes!!  They kept their shape and color and were tender.  I would recommend a 2:1 water:dried beans ratio, or at least that's what I'm going to try next time.  I used a 3:2 ratio which was fine straight out of the pot but the beans soaked up the extra juice when I refrigerated them.  I couldn't be happier with how well and fast the Instant Pot works.  I also made shrimp Alfredo all in the Instant Pot.  I sauteed the onions right in the pot, braised the shrimp right in the pot, added the pasta straight from the bag into the pot with chicken stock, set it for just 7 minutes, then added some cream and cheese and simmered for a couple minutes...it turned out almost perfect.  The pasta was a little tough, so I put it back on for another 2 minutes, and all I can say is Wow!.  One pot to clean, and 9 minutes to cook a great meal.  What more could you ask for!!  I recommend Bob Warden's Great Food Fast pressure cooker recipe book to go along with it.  It's available on Amazon.  I'm totally looking forward to using this cooker on a very regular basis."
1.0 out of 5 stars,"I used it the day before, it worked fine. Go to use it the next day, and wasn’t on or would turn on. Changed electrical outlets and still did not turn on.This is the second time it has stopped functioning for me and I just got it Jan 2 2020. (The first one only lasted a month. This one lasted all of 2months and a few days)Want to return it, but no button/link to do so.EXTREMELY disappointed. When it did work, it was excellent."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Once you learn how this works, you'll love it.  I did not find the directions very clear.  I know others who've had the same impression.  However, once I learned from my niece (who is very smart and also had to get help from a friend), I'm happy with it. It's quite simple to use the manual timer, which is the way I like to use it.  I don't trust the preset settings to come out perfectly, but maybe they do.  The manual settings have always been perfect for me.  Buy it and ask someone who has one how to use it.  It's worth the effort.  Good features over old-fashioned pressure cookers = easy to remove and put on lid; when needed, has the ability to release the steam/pressure to open faster (but be careful - hot enough to burn you - don't put your hands near the steam jutting up); easy to clean; not a kitchen full of pots to wash for a good meal.  Liner can go in dishwasher.  A little heavy, but all pressure cookers are.  I didn't think searing the meat in it would work well, but it does."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I wish I could write a song about you!Get one, your life will be forever changed.It's my workhorse for beans, braises and steaming tough veggies (kale, artichokes, eggplant, etc.)It makes the best soups in record time and you'll end up being able to multitask on more fun pan stuff on the stove while the boring things like bean cook in the Instant Pot.I made an amazing congee as well and the steamed Hainese Chicken was off the hook. You can put a whole small organic chicken in this baby!The grass fed chuck roast I made yesterday is delicious as well. Still learning so much and I love playing around with it!The only things you can't do well in a pressure cooker--any pressure cooker, not just this one--are delicate veggie/fish dishes and I wouldn't bother with anything that takes under 20 minutes to cook in general.I've learned that pressure cooking is not as instant as people want you to think--but it does save a huge amount of time without giving up the flavor, and in fact, amping up the flavor most of the time!"
1.0 out of 5 stars,Bought this few months back. Just started using. It is showing C1 error. no proper response from customer support. There is a manufacturing defect and customer support says they will have an engineer contact and the engineer has not contacted. Have tried multiple times. Product is definitely good as I have another larger Instant Pot but this is an issue with the seller. Poor service.
5.0 out of 5 stars,The Instant Pot is amazing! Love it!  The main reason I bought it is because I had one and I put to much water passing the maximum amount causing the machine to burn. My advice to anyone is to follow the guidelines giving in the instruction booklet carefully to avoid future careless mistake. The Instant Pot is awesome that's the main reason I couldn't stay without one at home. Thanks!
5.0 out of 5 stars,"One of my new favorite kitchen tools! The instapot has really revolutionized how I cook some of our family staples, and is saving a ton of time as well. For instance, once a week I used to bake a whole chicken for dinner, which took an hour, then used the carcass to make stock in the crock pot over 24-48 hours, then used the stock and left over chicken to make soup on the stove, which took 2-3 hrs. Now I can accomplish all three tasks in one day in the instapot. Stock only takes about an hour or two, and I can sautee my veggies and make soup in the instapot in 30 minutes. I can even cook a whole chicken in half the time! It tenderizes tough cuts of beef, doesn't overheat my kitchen, and is super easy to clean. We still have a lot more experimenting to do, but I use the instapot so frequently that it has become a permanent fixture on our counter. We've had ours for 8 months now and we love it."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"So far I have cooked beef stew, pinto beans, roast beef, and the butternut and ginger soup from the included recipe book. I am just getting started. but this is the best thing I have bought in a long time. Most things get done in 30 min or less. It is smart. letting me cook with just one touch. There is not the usual fear from a ""pressure cooker"". It takes care of everything. However if you are more brave than me or an advanced cook. You can go manual or adjust the times as programed. I have used the sauté feature (very nice). I have not yet used the yogert feature. or the slow cooker. This thing save me so much time I used to waste hovering over a pan. My wife works nights and so I can set the instant pot to cook. Sometimes she gets up early or late. the food is cooked and kept warm for hours. If I buy you a Christmas gift this year it will be this! I might even buy another one or 2 just for myself."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Bought this a couple of weeks ago and am just now getting around to using it.  I bought two, one for the house and one for our camper.  I have used a pressure cooker and slow cooker for years, but this one is so much easier and faster.  I love the keep warm feature for am out of the house often, so is still warm without having to check on it.  Am very pleased and will undoubtedly buy more as gifts."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I’m a picky eater in adult form. My meals used to consist of frozen pizzas and fries. That changed abrutly after I bought my instant pot. I’ve found that it is soooo simple to use that even I, with the cooking experience of a toddler, make delicious meals. I even get excited to cook and I want to try new meals. So yes the IP has changed my life."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I don't use it every day like some other reviewers. I use it about 4 or 5 times a week. But every time I use it, it gives me the results I was looking for. So far I've done yogurt(it's simple and phenomenal), stews, potatoes, rice... I have used it as a pressure cooker and as a steamer."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I first tried another electric pressure cooker, and got used to the idea of having and using one. When my previous cooker (a GoWise USA) quit working after eight months, the company told me that while it was still under warranty, I would have to pay to ship it back. In the meantime, I'd heard so much about Instant Pot that I decided not to get the GoWise fixed. Instead, I bought this -- and I have been nothing but pleased. It's much better designed than the GoWise in a number of ways. I haven't had to use their customer service, but all the stories I've heard have been that the company is great at responding to and solving customer problems. As far as electric pressure cookers in general, once you jump in and try using one, you'll wonder how you ever got along without one. I wanted this model in particular because it's the least expensive one to include a yogurt-making function, and I have gotten to where I like making my own yogurt."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I can’t say enough about the instant pot It’s amazing. It has so many functions and options. Beans can be cooked without soaking in 30 mins. Soups and broths, 30-45 mins. Oatmeal, 10 mins. You can cook great tasting rice in the instant pot HOWEVER I am a total rice snob and I feel like a dedicated rice cooker (zojirushi) is always best for my needs. I have made Chinese hot pot with my IP, currys, soups, and have made chicken and other meats for friends in it. Get one if you don’t have one yet. It really is a one stop gadget."
2.0 out of 5 stars,"First off I'd like to say that the only reason for the second star is because I absolutely did love my 6 qt model. However, just under 3 months of once or twice a week use and the dang thing won't turn on. It just died in the middle of making a roast."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This appliance is truly fantastic! It's wonderful to be able to use pressure steam without having to monitor status or worry.There are videos on youtube by instant pot if you'd like to see how this device works. That's how I researched it first.I've only had mine a couple of days and so far have easily made artichokes, hard boiled eggs and steel cut oats with raisins. It's a dream! I recommend that if you buy it, get ahold of (if you don't already have them) a steamer basket and small pyrex or heat tolerant bowls. Many recipes I've read have you use the provided steamer tray and then set either a steaming basket or bowl on top and fill, so the food is above the steam when cooking (I think this method also reduces the foam for gooey foods such as oats).You'll also need to add additional time for cooking if you use stovetop pressure cooker recipes given the pressure is lower for electronic ones (15 psi stovetop and about 11 for electric)  - no big deal. Adding time is something like 5 minutes.I found the cookbook ""Hip Pressure Cooking"" (she is the gal who is in some of the Instant Pot videos, so that's how I found her book) and her recipes account for both stovetop and electric.This pot also has a stainless steel liner, which is wonderful. The large capacity is useful too.For my part, I read the manual (online), watched the videos, read through some of the recipes -- all while my pot was in transit. That way, I was ready to go out of the gate. It also makes it easier. There is a bit of a learning curve if you're new to pressure, but the user guide and cook book cover the specifics."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are a fabulous addition to any kitchen or camping setup (with hookup). The whole range of sizes work perfectly for soup, scrambled eggs, rice, stew, steaming - you name it! Inner bowl very decent heavy duty stainless grade. The cast outer rim collects any moisture and a neat little cup catches the fluid.  (It can be fussy cleaning this rim if you're careless about not overfilling the inner bowl.)"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"My friends have been bragging about how great instant pots are. So of course I ordered one and have been pleased. I have cooked chicken, ribs and other meals that typically take a long time in the oven but mere minutes in the instant pot. I find that it is easy to go on-line and find recipes to try. Simply add water and press a button. Easy as pie. I have found that meats usually come out tender and juicy. This pot even comes with a small book. There are also suggestions on cleaning and maintaining the pot.  The pot saves a ton of time. I'd definitely recommend it."
3.0 out of 5 stars,"Very easy to use and makes everything crispy as long as used correctly. The reason for not giving it 5 stars is that the lining of the basket started peeling off after just 3 uses... we don’t clean it using the scrub side of the sponge, just the sponge side and it still peeled..."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm am love love loving this pot! Unlike my plain slow cooker, I can saute my onions, garlic or brown meat right in the Instant Pot before turning the setting to slow cooker or pressure cooker. No more having to dirty a separate pan for browning and sauteing. I love how fast I can make a meal with the pressure cooker, but also how I can keep things warm with the slow cooker or keep warm setting. And it's so easy to remove the insert bowl and just stick in the refrigerator (I put a dinner plate on top for a lid). Then we can ladle out soup or stew as we need it.I have used this Instant Pot several times a week since I got it. If I have time to cook in the morning I use the slow cooker. If I need to cook after work, I use the pressure cooker. Pretty much the same recipes--just change the settings and cooking time. With this cold winter weather, we're just loving the soups and stews I've been making. I absolutely love the versatility and that just one appliance can do all of these different things. This is an AWESOME invention!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I just wanted a pot to make a lot of good rice, and I got a whole lot more. There's so many features packed into this Instant Pot, I will have to start trying other things out besides just rice. The pot is easy enough to clean and main parts are dishwasher safe, that's goo news if you plan on really using it much. I will say this, there's a bit of a learning curve to make this work right. A lot of options and timing go into make perfect dishes, but stick to the rules/instructions and you'll have it working great in no time at all. It took me about 2-3 tries to make perfect rice.I've only had it a few weeks but have no encountered any issues yet, I will say I have heard a lot of others saying theirs broke after a short time but so far mine is good."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've never been much of a cook, but due to dietary needs, I am having to learn.  I absolutely LOVE the Instant Pot pressure cooker!  I've had it for a couple of weeks now.  I've made a couple different chicken wings recipes - so quick, and the wings are moist, fall off the bones, delicious!  I reduced the sauce used to cook the wings right in the Instant Pot.  I've made hard cooked eggs (""boiled"" eggs), and I'm never going to hard cook eggs any other way again!  The eggs are so much easier to peel after cooking them with pressure, and there's no boiling over mess, no cracked eggs, no muss, no fuss.  It's so simple.  I've also made ""egg muffins"", cooking my choice of fillings inside scrambled eggs, in silicone muffin cups.  Just set it and forget it, and again, no muss, no fuss.  I've cooked brown rice a couple of times - no presoaking needed, as I've done when using my rice cooker.  just rinse the rice, add whatever seasonings you like (I like Better than Bouillon Chicken Base, cayenne pepper, turmeric, and crushed red peppers), set it for 22 minutes at high pressure, and walk away.  The rice comes out PERFECT, and cleanup is a breeze.  I made Jambalaya, browning the sausage and chicken directly in the Instant Pot, before cooking the rice, tomatoes, bell pepper, celery, onion and seasonings in the same pot.  Once again, easy cleanup.  I LOVE THIS PRESSURE COOKER!"
2.0 out of 5 stars,So far nothing I have made turned out as it said. I just made beans and they took an hour and still weren’t done. I follow directions for time and it’s never ever done except that one time I made pulled pork and it was mush.  Burn notice every other time. I have regrets but now I’ve used it so it’s mine I guess. I’m sure there is a learning curve but I get better results just as fast on the stove... it’s probably going to just take up space in a cabinet soon if i don’t find a good purpose...
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Really liking this little appliance.  Have sautéed in it, made yogurt, used as a slow cooker AND pressure cooked.  Made hamburger vegetable soup in 30 minutes instead of 2 hours.  Made a roast in 40 minutes instead of 4 hours (not quite as tender as we like but flavorful and great in a pinch).  Be aware though, the cooking times referenced do NOT include the time it takes to warm up and build pressure (average 15 minutes before the times start counting down) and also do NOT include the time it takes to release pressure so you can open it up (quick release avg 5 minutes and natural release more like 15 minutes).  So really the roast and soup each took an hour +- 15 minutes TOTAL cook time.  Still worth it in my book as I have been using it daily and never considered making a roast or soup after work and having it for dinner that same night until now!  Seems like good quality parts too, works just like the book says."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This has been a great addition to my Instant Pot. It addresses one of the drawbacks of pressure cooking - browning and crisping foods cooked in the instant pot (Macaroni and Cheese and Chicken Carnitas, for 2 examples).  I have also been very happy with the air fryer function for ""frying"" foods without all the oil and fats. It really works to make crispy fries, and other foods. I have not yet gotten around to trying all it's functions and have already convinced by sister to buy one for her instant pot. I also bought one for my nephew (along with an Instant Pot) who recently moved into an apartment without a kitchen. Looking forward to trying more recipes and uses with my Air Fryer."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Update:  I'm still in love with the instant pot. We have purchased 2 more as gifts.  The instant pot really is versatile. It has replaced my slow cooker, rice maker and is in use almost daily as a pressure cooker. My absolute favorite is homemade chicken soup. In 15 minutes at pressure using frozen chicken breast.I use my instant pot almost every day. The sauté feature makes one pot cooking very easy.  I have made stews, soups, roasts,chicken, fish, oatmeal, chili, pasta sauces and so much more. The pressure cooking feature is what I use most. I still haven't tried it as s slow cooker but you could. It is a good rice maker and steams veggies well. I love it so well we are giving them as Presents to our family. I really recommend this to anyone. It is such a time saver. There are a lot of videos and recipes available on the website and the Internet."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"You need to read the manual for proper operation and safety. The Instant Pot is very safe as the electronic system keeps you from making mistakes, mind the instructions on venting the hot steam for a ""quick release"" and a few other details and you will be fine. The inner pot is super heavy duty stainless steel and has not been a problem to clean; I don't own a dishwasher and I do wash my stainless steel pots and pans by hand.The fast cooking time and even results have been a joy. You can load it up, set it to cook on the timer and it will also kick in a ""keep warm"" setting so you can leave it alone like a slow cooker. I needed something to make hot food during the summer and not turn my apartment into an inferno. This unit gives off way less heat than my cheapo rice steamer or ordinary old Crock Pot. The 6-quart size compares to a large, oval Crock Pot. I bought the combo of the 6-quart pressure cooker, tempered glass lid and the cookbook for $125 (free shipping). The cookbook has a range of gluten-free, vegetarian and ordinary recipes that has been a good introduction to the techniques of using the pressure cooker. I made a curry dish and a risotto that was fabulous in the first week. Perfect hard-boiled eggs are a breeze. I grew up canning with my grandmother, so if you are a canner, maybe consider the larger size model as it will hold more jars."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Is there any greater invention on this earth than the instant pot?! I'm surprised that Steve Jobs didn't invent this, he was probably too busy with other things. I love this product and use it every week. It makes cooking so easy. I use it to cook larger quantities of food, then I freeze, and store for later. This way I always have something that I like that I can just take out of my freezer, defrost, microwave and eat. I don't know how I lived before without my instant pot. I have given my sisters instant pots as gifts and they love it too."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have always been intimidated by pressure cookers and complicated devices, but I am SO glad friends and family talked me into trying this!  It could not be easier to use!  I have had it for four days and I have already used it twice!  Once to make ""rotisserie"" chicken and once to make a bone broth from the remains.  Both items were VERY easy to make and clean up was a breeze!  I've used the saute and pressure functions and without spending a lot of extra time reading the manual.  Very happy with my Instant Pot!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have a 6 Qt. Instant Pot that I use occasionally and enjoy for preparing larger meals, but the 3Qt. Is just perfect if you’re cooking for just one or two people, or for side dishes.  I use mine daily.  It makes perfect boiled eggs that nearly peel themselves every time.  It’s very easy to use, gives consistent results once you’ve experimented a bit, and is easy to clean. It’s also very safe, a huge improvement over the old stove top pressure cookers we used to use."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Purchased on Prime day 2019 for savings on a device I wasn't hyped about like everybody else.I use it mostly to cook a whole chicken, make broth, and cook sweet potatoes without having to use a lot of water and heat up my kitchen in the summer. It requires a learning curve and it didn't seem to save time in the beginning but once you get used to it really saves time. It's really a SET IT AND FORGET IT thing without taking the whole day. It's perfect for meal preppers and batch cooking."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Many friends recommended the instant pot... I thought it was a ridiculous expensive cult-thing since I've never used a pressure cooker... but after dropping the mic and buying one... I think it's the greatest thing I've ever purchased in my life.  It's a game changer... recipes on Pinterest are endless.. (cookbooks for the instant pot have FEWWWW recipes and they're NOT very good.. go with the FREE recipes online... they're amazing!)  For example ---- completely frozen chicken breasts are cooked in 30 minutes and taste flawless...I have made meals I would never have attempted, but have not had a 'fail' with the family... this is one of those ""life changing"" products that is less of a 'bandwagon' and more of a Mom's 'dream come-true', this non-cooking-capable Mom's dream come-true, anyway!!!!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,This is our second instant pot. We had one of the original ones and this one has some nice upgrades like a slot to hold the lid. Well made product.
4.0 out of 5 stars,"Pros: It is such a versatile multi-function cooker. I own a 3 quart, but the 6 quart is bigger and have a few more functions. It also came with a steaming accessory with handles that a 3 quart does not have.Cons: The ""Saute"" fonction could make a mess, depends on what you cook. Because the electric base of the cooker is not dishwasher safe, I have to hand clean it, which I don't really like.Bonus: There is a lot of handy and creative accessories designed for instant pot in the market, which makes cooking more convenient and more fun."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love this thing! After hearing so many good things about the Instant Pot, I finally pulled the trigger on Prime day, and even with high expectations, I am not disappointed! I've only used the pressure cooker feature thus far, but since that's the main reason I bought it, and it's worked out fabulously. Chicken wings, salmon, shredded chicken...the possibilities seem endless.I like that the pot is easy to clean (I normally throw it in the dishwasher), and the instructions are pretty clear. Looks like good construction too."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I ordered my 8 qt. Instant Pot DouPlus on Sunday 8-26-19 and received it on Thursday 8-29-2019. I did my water test on Saturday and passed with flying colors! We are in the path of Hurricane Dorian, so I decided to cook my ribs as my first meal in this pot before the hurricane moved in our area along East Coast. The ribs were fabulous and served it with corn on the cob, which was cooked in my 6 qt. Instant Pot DuoPlus. I own the Instant Pot 3 qt. DuoPlus and continuously use and love it. In fact, I love all my Instant PotsThank you Amazon for the quick delivery and Instant Pot for your product."
3.0 out of 5 stars,"Pretty easy to use despite all the buttons. Keep in mind the cooking process involves pressurizing, cooking, then depressurizing. This takes time. Like anything, there's also a bit of a learning curve involved here. For example, I made a beef stew using a recipe I found on the web. It was simple to throw together and cooking was as easy as pushing the Meat/Stew button. The stew turned out to be very tasty but a lot of the meat had fallen apart. To make matters worse, if you like carrots and potatoes in your stew, you can't just open the lid and throw them in. You have to wait until the meat is done and the pot depressurized before you can open the lid to add the carrots and potatoes. Depressurizing can take 15 minutes. After you've mixed the carrots and potatoes into the stew, you have to go through the whole pressurize/cook/depressurize process again and this adds another good chunk of time. I'm still a novice with the Instant Pot, but I've decided I like my stew cooked the traditional way."
1.0 out of 5 stars,"we had the unit for 8 weeks, used it 4 times and then it would not power on.  Return window of this unit is 4 weeks.  When it worked it was great, but the warranty is lousy.  4 weeks for this is ridiculous.  I surly will not recommend this to anyone I know."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love love love! I bought it because the non-stick inner pot for my Korean Pressure Rice Cooker is all scratched up and there was no way to replace it and I didn't want to be consuming toxins. I have also been wanting a new steamer, pressure cooker and big-batch cook pot for awhile so this fulfilled all the functions and then some! I am not unfamiliar with pressure cookers, I use an old stove-top aluminium one (no tomatoes/acid unfortunately!) for curry mutton/lamb but it's a hassle babying it to pressure time + having to carry the heavy pressured pot to sink to run water for a quick release.Love the set it and forget it of this electric version, love the pot in pot cooking, love that the stainless steel inner pot is thick and easy to clean. It's so simple and intuitive to use that  I've been cooking in it almost every day since I bought it. I haven't tackled my curries, ribs, brisket and tough meat cuts yet but my my penne pasta in beef ragu and bone broth chicken soup turned out fantastic.You'll want to experiment with liquid amounts, food layering and timing for optimal results but there's plenty of support at the online FB community. My only hope is for durability and that it lasts me years!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Didn't want to write a review until had enough time to really try this out.  I have made one pot meals, ribs, chops, roasts and hard boiled eggs in this and find it very easy to use.  Chili or casserole type meals work well, but not meals where you're cooking like corn beef, potatoes and cabbage together.  Hasn't worked well for me.  Love doing hard boiled eggs this way! So easy to peel and quick too!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I loved this thing from day one, however there are definitely some myths to dispel when using this.  Pros: it's pretty effortless and can cook just about anything, including quick steamed potatoes with perfect consistency.  The only real con I can come up with... the lid/silicone ring is a complete pain in the butt to clean/get the ""cooking smell"" out of.  That said, this is not a ""quick"" cooking solution by any means.  Many meals require the vessel to depressurize naturally, which takes quite some time... the ease of use makes that minor issue easy to overlook. :)"
4.0 out of 5 stars,These Insta pot cookers are really an amazing thing to have if you work all the time and feel like you don't have time to make meals. I have found that this particular brand is that extremely easy to use and cooks the food  evenly. It's especially helpful if you spent a long day at work and you get home or you just want have some food ready for you in your crockpot. I've also found that it makes making healthier meals a lot more doable and easier in terms of like steaming  rice and vegetables. I definitely think it's a little investment but if you're looking for a good quality pot and you don't mind spending a little bit more on  it then I would give it a chance. Also I think it's worth knowing that I don't think there's any toxic or harmful chemicals in this particular pot which is something I pay a lot of attention to nowadays. So I do think it will be a healthier choice to go with this crockpot if that something you've been thinking about.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I LOVE this thing! It works as a crockpot too! I think if I were to purchase it again though, I'd probably go for a model that has fewer functions only because I don't need most of them. It's nice to have the option but I don't see myself baking in it or making yogurt in it. One piece of advice, a lot of recipes will say ""only 20 minutes"" but you have to remember that it takes time to ""de-pressurize"" after the timer goes off so sometimes recipes do take a bit longer than they actually state. I've made rice, curry, bone broth, stock, it's fantastic!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"My sister is the one who recommended this product to me, as she had read raving reviews about it.  I wasn't really that interested in buying a pressure cooker until I heard how fast it can cook things like dried beans or frozen meat.  This pressure cooker had the highest rating for the price, so I decided to give it a try.Never having used a pressure cooker before, it was a little scary to use at first.  I watched a few YouTube videos on how to use it, which was helpful.  After the 4th or 5th time using it, I felt comfortable that it wouldn't explode.  It is actually very simple to use once you get the hang of it.  Another benefit is that the settings can be used preset or customized.  It's also very easy to clean - the inside pot comes out and is dishwasher safe, while the lid and rubber ring just need to be rinsed with water and left to dry.I use it 2-3 times a week and am very happy with the cooking results.  The pressure cooker came with a few recipes and a chart listing the cooking times of common foods.  I reference this chart every time I cook with the pressure cooker.  Although I've noticed that some foods (like potatoes) I have to cook a lot longer, but I figure that's because I am at a pretty high altitude.  Other foods, however, will still cook in 1-2 minutes (like asparagus and other fresh veggies).  I'm still amazed every time.  Everything I've cooked in it has tasted great!  And the vegetables always look more vibrant in color too!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love this!!!! Both my husband and i work full time jobs and dont get home till the evening. This product has changed the way we organize and cook our meals. There are so many recipes online, many are just dump in and set. It has helped up prepare meals in fraction of the time, the type of meals we would wait to make during  the weekends. Makes cooking rice so easy and tasty. Makes meats like beef or goat so tender. Doesnt push the pressured air out like normal pressure cookers causing your whole home to smell. I been recommending this product to all my friends and family."
5.0 out of 5 stars,I like the convenience of this lid. Easy to use and clean the insert that goes inside the Instant pot. I would recommend if you do not want a separate small appliance. The insert is not very big so need to cook in small batches.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I put off buying an instapot for 2 years because i didnt want to pay so much for a glorified crock pot. Now that i have taken the plunge, bought and used one...... i will never ever go back to using traditional pots ever again. I LOVE this thing! I often debone/ prep and/or render entire chicken carcasses into broth etc. The process from start to finnish would take me 2 days and be a pain in my but, but the Instapot does it for me in a fraction of the time, with no mess and the meat just falls off the bones so easily. I barely have to prep. I can totaly understand why people who own Instapots usualy own more than 1.  I have owned it 10 days now and have cooked with it almost every night.  Cons: the instapot smart phone recipe ap is useless and small. They should not advertize it on the box when it sucks as bad as it does."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I was sucked in by all the hype, and I'm glad I was. This thing cooks frozen chicken in 12 minutes (minus the 5 minutes it takes to come to pressure). I love the ease of throwing things in & not having to babysit it. I've made soups, Italian dishes, yogurt, & cheesecakes, as well as basics like: spaghetti squash, boiled eggs, chicken breast, potatoes. I would suggest buying an extra sealing ring, as it's nice to have one sweet & one savory, because smells of previous dishes can linger on the lid & liner. After a few months of use, the only thing I'm concerned about is the fact that I need to push down for just a second on the lid as it's coming to pressure (I can hear the steam escaping loudly, & it seems to take way longer for the pressure pin to drop if I don't)."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"It's been 2 months since I purchased my 6 qt Instant Pot and I have not regretted my purchase for a second! I love that I can start my meal and leave the kitchen to do other things. I've used my range twice in the last month thanks to this amazing machine, and that was only to heat canned vegetables while the main course was in my Instant Pot. I've made whole chicken, fall-off-the-bone ribs, turkey, spaghetti, boiled eggs, rice, enchilada casserole, cheesecake, real chicken stock that was used to make chicken noodle soup (yes, noodles and veggies cooked together!), pot roast...the list goes on and on. I haven't tried the yogurt setting only because I don't know what I'd do without this machine for 12 hours! My husband also loves it because we're only using 1 dish to make nearly every meal. Less cook time, less cleanup, and healthier dishes? What's not to love?The only issue I've had with my IP is the cord coming loose from the back. I didn't realize this was the problem until after I'd thrown away a mean in frustration thinking my IP was broken. I wish the cord was fixed, but that is a minor complain for an otherwise amazing machine!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,This is a powerful  steel pressure cooker that cooks super fast. I liked how this is steel inside instead of aluminum or nonstick material. I ordered 8 qt which was too tall for my petite height when I cooked on counter top so I had to return it. The sellers picked it up next day when I requested a return and now I will order a 6 quart one hoping it will be about the right height for me while cooking.
4.0 out of 5 stars,"I like the options and settings on this model. What I do not like is that this seems to be finickier than my original 6qt. My kids wash the dishes and sometimes leave some residue of food in the pot. I have never had a problem with my 6qt but a couple of times now with this 8qt, it will tell me the food is burning and it turns off. I end up having to finish cooking whatever i am making via another method."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Wow! Loved it! Did a Sunday cooking marathon with it! Made Stuffed cabbage, stuffed peppers, and a meatloaf! All good and in a fraction of the time it would have taking me with the stove! Cooked a whole head of cabbage in 8 mins and rice in 11 mins! I'm really impressed! I was holding out, because I was afraid of the whole pressure cooking safety thing! It is was so easy to use and I have no qualms about it now! I might have to get the larger one in the future! I got the 6qt which is fine for a small family, but the large one would really be great for a party or holiday! Tons of recipes online to try!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I can't believe how much we use the Instant Pot. We bought it largely on a whim (on a great Cyber Monday sale if I recall), but we use it for dinner or a side dish at least once a week, sometimes far more. It's especially proven to be great for making Indian recipes, dishes that use dried beans, stews, and a variety of chicken options. Mostly though, we use it for Indian food. It's also a perfectly serviceable rice cooker, we've made cheese (paneer), chili, and I'm sure I'm missing stuff. The ability to saute ingredients before pressure cooking simplifies everything (especially cleaning up), though it's not quite hot enough to put a good sear on meat.The only issue we have is that it tends to make just enough food for the two of us if we're pretty hungry, not many leftovers, and not ideal for when we have guests (we use it for side dishes when people are visiting). If I had to do it over, I think we may have chosen the larger capacity version."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've had the Instant Pot for a few weeks. I use it to make yogurt, which comes out consistently good every time. I've cooked rice in it, hard boiled eggs, delicious white beans cooked without soaking, and delicious, tender chicken in a sauce. There are tons of recipes on the web I intend to try with different foods, including chick pea stew and fish stew.I like that I can sautee things in the pot and then throw in other ingredients before I close it up for pressure cooking; it's one pot cooking at its best. It's fast, and it's consistent. It's my new toy..."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Just got this air dryer and I love it!  It also acts as an oven and the display is really easy to use.  Just plug and play.I have made broccoli, brussel sprouts, and beans so far and they are super delicious.  The best of it is the clean up.  The packaging came with an insert so I just washed the insert and the pot with soap and everything came off easily.There is a strange smell from the insert so I am hoping that will go away soon.Overall, I am very happy with this purchase."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I feel like we've had the Instant Pot long enough to rate it properly. What an easy way to make a meal and easy to clean up! We have tried ribs, chicken, roast and vegetables to name a few. Getting used to cooking times takes time but we use the guide in the recipe book and the pre-programmed  buttons to get there and we learn a bit as we go. Cooking times are really FAST, it actually takes longer to get up to speed than it does to cook. Most settings are automatic; it starts the timer when it's properly pressurized, tells you when it's done, automatically goes to a warm hold and more. The preset buttons make it all pretty easy and you can add more or less pressure and cooking times depending on what you have inside. Clean up is easy, just remove the bowl, wash it and the lid and you're done. Pretty hard not to like this appliance. I have a hint for cooking some of your recipes. Instead of water we use chicken or beef broth.Oh by the way, the other reviewers are right, the sealing ring does smell especially if you use garlic and onions as we do. Sorry, there isn't anything you can do about it. Just enjoy the cooker, it's worth the smell."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love it.  Bought 3 more for sons and granddaughter.  Use it almost daily.  Especially the hard boiled egg feature.  They come out fluffy and no discoloration, Always easy to peel even if you do not tend to them right away.  Oatmeal needed time adjustment as I prefer mine al dente.  Dried beans are a breeze and turn out soft inside with skins intact. Use it for all my soups and meat dishes.  Pot is easy to clean up as dishwasher safe(stainless) although the ring does have an odor, it also goes in the dishwasher."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Rice cooker, slow cooker, pressure cooker.... I've always cooked rice on the stove in a 2 quart pot, always cooked beans after an all-night soaking, used the crock pot for soups and stews... Damn, this thing does all these tasks with ease! For rice, just add rice and water then hit the RICE button and the Instant Pot does the rest.... so far perfect every time. For beans... no soaking, just add beans, water and any other items and set your own pressure cooking time. Perfect pinto beans in 60 minutes! And add that I purchased during the Amazon Day Sale when it was $55.... soooo happy!!"
4.0 out of 5 stars,My boyfriend had ordered the 3qt for me by mistake. It was cute but way too small! It can't really accommodate much. Even for me who lives by myself i think it is way too small! You can barely fit one breast of chicken in there and if you wanted to put your vegetables...lol...there's not much room for much...do your self a favor and just go for the 6qt at least. We ended having to return and getting the 6qt which I'm very happy with BTW:)
5.0 out of 5 stars,Great appliance.  We have only used it for a limited set of recipes like rice.  It's pretty easy to use.  Our only item  of confusion was the digital display.  It was difficult to discern whether it was showing minutes and seconds or hours and minutes. The internal removable stainless steel pot makes it easy to clean in the dishwasher.
1.0 out of 5 stars,"I really wanted this cooker. Once I got it home to set up, read all the material, down to the last step and the lid wouldn't close. Spent 2 more hours trouble shooting and it never did. So disappointed. Don't trust to buy another one. So much hassel. Just not worth it. 😟"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I hate cooking but I usually eat clean and have a lot of kids so eating out isn't always favorable because it's not exactly healthy. I try to cook as healthy as possible for my kids too, but it is so time consuming. This pot has made my life sooooo much easier. It has so many functions but I mainly use the Sautée and pressure. Now you don't have to brown your meat or chicken in a separate skillet, you can do everything in the Instant Pot. Unlike other electric cookers, this one is stainless steel (not nonstick). It's easy to use and clean; and it's perfect for busy people, or people who don't like to waste their precious time in the kitchen. I use it almost daily so it has paid itself off in eating out expenses. It's also pretty big, so it's perfect for large families. When I come home from work tired, I throw in a bunch of frozen vegetables and ground beef, or fish and I have a meal in less than 20 minutes. For those that don't like to drench their food in oil, this is also good because the food doesn't stick to the pot, usually. Generally, the food is done even before the rice cooker finishes. One thing to note is that the time doesn't include the amount of time it takes to heat up the cooker and build pressure. I could go on about how much I love this thing, but I think you get the picture."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"The best and fastest Taco Soup ever. Three+ meals out of the batch. One with tortilla chips, one with corn bread.The whole chicken was delicious, but looked awful - needed to be put in the oven to brown after pressure cooking. I did not want to brown in the Instant Pot before pressure cooking because I wanted to cut the fat. Cooked the chicken with a little chicken seasoning (no MSG) from the 7th Day Adventist store. The stock (jellied, not liquid) was wonderful for soup later. I just put it in the refrigerator, it congealed, and I picked the fat off the top and gave it to the dogs. They LOVED it.I love the programmable features, and that I can walk away and not have to stay and watch it cook.Problem - When cooking the whole chicken, I let the pot steam release naturally and when I took it out it wasn't hot enough. The kids like to watch the steam release.Problem - The gasket retains the odor of whatever has been cooked, no matter how many times I remove it and wash it. I may try soaking it in a bowl of baking soda solution or buy and label separate gaskets for Mexican, Italian, and chicken/beef with no seasoning. My old (too small) pressure cooker with gray rubber gasket never retained odors like this one does. I store the Instant Pot with the lid upside down and the gasket removed to let it air out between uses, but the gasket doesn't release the odors."
2.0 out of 5 stars,"These pots are great when they work, but they're not very reliable.  I've used mine lightly, mostly to make yogurt.  It became unreliable14 months after purchase.  Now it *pretends* to cook, but in reality it sometimes shuts off a few minutes after starting.  If you're not there to hear the unexpected beep, you won't realize that it just skipped several hours of actual cooking.I've tried to use it this evening, and it's turned itself off twice so far.  Both times it pretended that it was all finished, but in reality the food was still cold from the refrigerator.  We're on the third try now, and I think it's going to go ahead and actually cook this time.Manufacturer provides a one-year warranty.  You may want to consider an extended warranty."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"We love this. We have steamed, boiled, saute, slow cooked and pressure cooked for over two months now. All have been perfect. I bought this to replace our broken slow cooker. I talked the wife into buying this even though it was twice the price of slow cookers we were looking at. My wife is glad we purchased the Instant Pot. It is a true all in one cooking pot. It even cooks rice perfectly.  In fact we final got rid of our ten year old rice cooker. It was as old as the slow cooker and on it's last leg too.Also the inside pot is heavy duty with a nice heavy stainless steel bottom. The control panel is easy to use and to adjust the temperature or time. The interior and exterior are easy to clean. Remember to remove the pressure ring when cleaning it.One other thing we love is the safety features, you can not open the lid if there is any pressure. The exterior is warm to the touch but not hot. even though there is a warning on the lid about being hot, ours is never too hot to touch. You do have to be careful about releasing steam. You have to make sure to use the lever and not be directly above the steam vent.We will highly recommend Instant Pot all our friends and family."
5.0 out of 5 stars,I love this its so easy to use and makes me want to cook cleaning is a snap.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"My new favorite kitchen appliance, for the old top favorite (instant pot)! Now I truly can make anything and finish it in the instant pot too. Does fries and reheats food so nicely.  I can make leftovers even better than the first. It was slow to make jerky, because it’s small. But perfect for 2 person meals. I use this almost daily! Oh, and a tip I learned to help get the dehydrated layer out when it’s hot is to use chopsticks—much better than tongs."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Every dish I cook , I like it better than the dish before. Make sure before you start that the silicone seal is on correctly and that the pot is well sealed. Depending on which model you have, make sure the knob on top is turned to seal. (Wash the seal after you have used the pot, soak in vinegar to remove any odor. I first cooked Swiss steak, still a unable to get the smell out. The smell will not affect the new dish you cook. I love my pot."
3.0 out of 5 stars,"I eagerl looked forward to receiving my Instant Pot.  I have now decide to ""bite the bullet"" and take the loss and buy a different one.  First, the instruction book that came with it had recipes for mouth-watering family favorites like TURNIP CAKE.  Seriously?  And, despite the buttons on the front for different kinds of foods, every recipe's instructions were for MANUAL settings and were quite involved.  I don't know about other people, but my point in buying is to accomplish a healthy meal easily and simply.  So I watched for recipe books to come out, and finally they started being released.  But guess what.  Their recipes were for MANUAL settings.  Really?  Are those buttons just decorative adornments?  So I contacted Customer Service about a refund and explained what I had encountered.  Their attitude could be summed as ""Tough luck, sucka!""  They did not offer any information about the buttons.  I woud have chosen fewer stars but I'm giving them the benefit of the doubt as a technologically correct product.  Just not why I buy a modern pressure cooker."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"So far as I have only used this product only a couple of times, it has been a very good product.  I really like the 2 quart size, for small meals.  It takes a few seconds to get use to the setup, the instructions are not totally clear on all the so called programming.  Easy to clean also."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"learning to use it is somewhat intimidating and i use a regular pressure cooker on my stove. the book doesn't tell you what you need, but if you start looking at pinterest and amazon kindle books as well as friends and blogs on the instant pot, you will learn invaluable information. i use mine almost daily now. i mean why use the stove when this pot does EVERYTHING? i made potato soup in this last night and it was fast, hot and delicious. no large soup pot to lift from the stove. i love the saute option. it's like cooking on the stove, but you can brown your meat and veggies then add your sauce and pasta, change it to the right option, and cook it without standing over the pot. i love that. with a stove top pressure cooker, i had to stay nearby to make sure it was ok."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"so good for hot weather cooking. our rice cooker died, our stovetop pressure cooker needed a new and hard to find gasket, and we had three slow cookers just sitting in a cabinet doing nothing. we bought this and replaced all those appliances with just one. it has satisfied every requirement, performs better than out stovetop pressure cooker did, and doesn't heat the house up while doing it! makes fantastic rice or all kinds, only wish there was a teflon coated insert available specifically for it but that's not a big deal at all. steams perfectly, browns onions and meat conveniently while not creating more dirty dishes than absolutely necessary. it's magical. can not recommend this enough."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This product is beyond description!!! The food comes out amazing, it doesn't heat up the kitchen, there are so many recipes for meals and desserts to be used in this...had about the best cheesecake from the Instant Pot and I'm fussy about my cheesecake!!!...and within minutes the food is on the table and delectable. I made St. Louis ribs last night and it fell off the bones, they were juicy and so flavorful!!! Looking forward to years of happiness with this kitchen appliance!!! Perfect for those that work, home school or are just tired out. Wonderful meals in minutes!!! You can even cook frozen meats and have it on the table in less than 1/2 hour. You can't imagine how wonderful this machine cooks up mouth watering meals in minutes. Can't say enough!!!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I just received my Multi Pot today.I became aware of the product while participating in a message board discussion about slow cookers.I own a very sturdy electric pressure cooker—one of the earliest models; I own a Fagor Multipot as well. Both work well for me.Why buy another? Because I was intrigued and impressed with the pre-programmed buttons of the Multi Pot. And after reading all the great reviews here, I couldn't resist.I've only used this appliance once—to make a hearty beef stew tonight. The stew recipe was for a slow cooker, and required preparation steps using the stovetop. I simply did all the stovetop steps in the Instant Pot on Sauté, then when everything was assembled in the pot, I put the lid in place, set the vent to pressure, and selected the Stew setting. 35 minutes later I had a perfect stew.I also bought the glass lid that fits the inner pot. So when the recipe was done, I speed released the pressure, removed the pressure lid, and put the glass lid in place. The cooker kept the stew at proper serving temperature until I was ready to eat.After eating and storing the leftovers, I found that the stainless steel inner pot practically rinsed clean. It was so much easier to clean than the non-stick inner pots of my other two cookers.This product is a solid winner."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love this thing.  We have not utilized anywhere near it's potential yet but we are having lots of fun so far.  Simple recipes and, especially quick made from scratch soups, are VERY fast.  The flavors including herbs and spices that are infused into meats are incredible.  My family is enjoying some far healthier meals because of the use of this cooker rather than the preparation of frozen processed food when we are all busy.  There is a learning curve with using this cooker, I suspect with all pressure cookers.  This cooker absolutely works as advertised so far and we will be having some fun with new recipes in the near future.  There are several good to great cookbooks written with this cooker in mind.  I am happy to have chosen this brand upon recommendation."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"For a single person, the size of this is perfect for stews, hard-boiled eggs (5 minutes!)... and other small quantity dishes.Only negative is that the rings tend to smell.Best to order an additional set and switch them out from time to time."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought this originally for my wife for last Christmas (she wanted one for months!). Since buying it I cook dinner 3-4 days out of the week and it's always with the instant pot! Recipes are easy to come by and the fact you can cook EVERYTHING in the one pot (sautee for searing meats and onions ect) is amazing, one thing to clean at the end minus plates. We bought one for my brother and his fiance, they love theirs too."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"The pot itself is great so far. I have no issues with it. The listing states that this comes with a rice spoon, a soup spoon and a measuring cup. We had a new unit sent to us, assuming those items were missing from our order. The new order also did not have them included, and there is nothing on the instructions or box to indicate they are supposed to be. I think the listing is not accurate. It's not a huge deal as we have a million utensils anyway, but just thought I would put it out there, in case someone is specifically looking for those items."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"It can get a little messy and the slow cook feature is not as good as a true slow cooker - my chicken usually comes out feeling a little rubbery instead of fall apart. But it makes killer steamed rice and amazing rice pilaf. I haven't had a chance to try out everything on it, but for now, it is a staple in my home just for the rice function."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"I replaced my five year old Cuisinart pressure cooker with this one.  The price was about the same.  The power cord is much shorter which is a negative - I'm researching alternatives for the cord.  I am not 100 percent used to the way it works and especially confused by the programmed buttons.  There is no documentation that I have found that explains exactly what each programmed cooking program includes  (e.g. how many minutes at each temperature)- so that is annoying.  On the other hand, I made my best chili ever using the pre-set chili button.  So I may up date this review in the future."
1.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased the item around December, and at first it worked fine.HOWEVER, 2 and a half months after my purchase, the instant pot simply stopped working. The real issue is the way that both Instant Pot and Amazon treated my pleas for assistance.Firstly, Instant Pot will not cover any of its' products to countries outside the U.S and Canada. This means that if you're like me, a resident of a foreign country that also has a malfunctioning instant pot, you're pretty much on your own.Now comes Amazon's part of the deal. Amazon WILL sell the instant pot to countries outside the U.S and Canada, yet when I've tried to ask Amazon for help replacing (not returning) the item, they offered a cut and paste response leading me to contact Instant Pot again, which is basically sending me to an endless loop without any help.This is exactly why YOU SHOULD NOT ORDER this item if you're a resident of any country other than the U.S andCanada. Should your instant pot stop working for any reason, you will be stuck without any assistance from neither party, Amazon or Instant Pot.Horrible service and a horrible policy (selling a product to countries which are not part of the warranty policy, as well as not providing support from Amazon)."
4.0 out of 5 stars,I like this cuz I can cook my soup beans in 20 minutes. Bake a cake if you know what you're doing. Unlimited options. Now the control board is not attached in the best so don't beat it up it's not a toaster nor does it have the price tag of one haha. Aside from that should treat you well I bought two if that tells you anything. Makes a good gift. Side note though use all the safety features or it will not cook correctly in pressure cooker mode could even be catastrophic.
1.0 out of 5 stars,"The lid to my old Instant Pot fell on the floor and was no longer steaming. I looked at replacing but the lids are just as much as a new IP, so I went ahead and bit the bullet. I had my old IP for 2 1/2 years and didn't have a single issue with it. Everything came out perfect. I used my new one for the first time last night and got a ""burn"" message for a recipe that worked completely fine in my old IP. I had no idea what was happening and had to look it up to find out that yes, it indeed was letting me know my food was burning.  I couldn't understand, I didn't even know that message was a thing. After doing some reading online, it seems the newer model are much more prone to ""burning"" than the older IPs. What a disappointment. I'm going to try the lid on my old IP to see if it works and if not I will be returning."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my second purchase of this same model. The first one had an unfortunate mishap with the stove top (burner was accidentally turned on and the bottom melted. Fortunately, it didn't ruin my stovetop and I got to keep the inner pot as an extra, which has come in handy multiple times (making rice to go with the meal I just cooked for example). I have taken this camping where I used it as an extra place to cook (browning meat for campfire pizzas, chicken tacos, as a slow cooker for breakfast casserole, etc.). I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE it! It makes perfect rice and boiled eggs, having the ability to brown first and use the same pot for cooking is awesome and with a busy family having a way to cook quickly (and from frozen) is a plus."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm horrible at cooking meats when it comes to an oven or a grill. Basically I'm not a very good cook in general if my husband isn't around. This thing makes me feel like a pro! It's so easy!My fave meal so far that I made is Hawaiian BBQ Chicken. I seriously just mix all the wet ingredients together, mix the chicken in it, and dump it all in my Instant Pot, push the poultry setting, and then I walk away! 20-25 mins later it's done. I've mostly cooked chicken in it, but I've never had to worry about it being undercooked, and the dinner I threw together in 5 mins is delicious!Cleaning up is also easy because you only need the one pot to do it all!! Ok, sometimes I cook rice in my rice cooker (Rice in the IP is so much better though, but I only have one IP for now 😉) to go along with the meal, but still, this really cuts down on the dishes!My husband and I always forget to take a meat out of the freezer in the morning to thaw by dinner time. Or are too lazy to throw a meal together in the crock pot the night before so that we can start it in the morning before work. That's literally not even a problem anymore with this thing. There are so many quick and easy recipes out there, it's a lifesaver for people on the go! Seriously, everyone needs to get one."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"It’s easy to use and pot material is easy to clean.  It can replace stove cooking,slow cooker and pressure cooker.  The only reason I give four stars, because it’s measurement chart is not inside of the pot.  When you put food and water, how can you know how much that you put, the pot is not glass and you can not see food and water level from out side.  This design is so wired.  If they can change it in future product, I will highly recommend my friends to buy it.  The price is reasonable."
5.0 out of 5 stars,I could wax poetic about my Instant Pot. I also own a 6 quart Duo and decided to pull the trigger when the 8 quart went on sale. I love this thing. It's great for making rich stocks/broths in a couple of hours. It's great for steaming sweet potatoes for mashing quickly with little mess. Pulled pork is quick and easy. The saute function is great...you can build a base and finish the meal in the same pot. I also have colitis and sometimes during a flare up need to limit myself to very well cooked vegetables and meat...the Instant Pot allows me to throw a couple of things in and have a meal quickly. I've started ribs in the pot and finished them under the broiler in under an hour. Pot roast. Pulled pork. Congee. Beef stew. I am personally responsible for the sale of three other Instant Pots after telling colleagues how much I love mine.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I haven't had the Instant Pot very long, but I have made three meals in it.  It is easy to use, cooks quickly and clean up is easy.  I really am enjoying  it!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"As a senior citizen, living alone in the state of FL, I do no enjoy using the oven or boiling ANYTHING for a prolonged period of time. I just can't say enough of this useful, mini (3 quarts) cooking pot. Used it the same day it got here...beef stew & steamed veggies. All cooked to perfection and with very little exterior heat. Safe, stays warm once it finishes cooking, perfection."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Having fun with this pot. Because it takes 10 to 15 minutes to heat up before cooking time, and another 10-20 minutes for it to cool down, the cooking time altogether is longer than what you see in videos. This is not a deterrent because it is faster and I don't have to be near the pot. Once I push the time for now or to start later, it cooks by itself. The settings are low, medium and high pressure. The temperatures are listed in the book that comes with the pot. Made a pork loin roast, chicken with vegetables and a chicken soup from the left over chicken and broth. Added noodles to soup and it was great. The delayed cooking means I can go grocery shopping and not have to run home to turn on the pot. I can run errands or shop and not worry because the pot will start even if I am running late."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought this along with Urvashi Pitre's Indian Instant Pot® Cookbook.  We've cooked 6 or 7 things already (2 from the cookbook) and they've all been pretty successful. My husband LOVES making soft-boiled eggs with it. Oh, and soup is more flavorful.The only failing was that I saw on a video that the pot lid can be made to stand on the side of the pot via the holes in the handles. After washing, the next morning, the handle was cracked on both sides where the lid was balancing.  The video warned of this, but we didn't touch it.  I think the cat was sniffing it and leaned on it.  We're going to fix it w Gorilla glue so it will be ugly but functional."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Hey so, I'm not a great cook and I've always been intimidated by crock pot recipes that are supposed to be easy. I'm a procrastinator and getting everything together early in the morn to have it for dinner isn't my thing.I recieved my instant pot in the mail today and with the temps being around 30° I wanted to cook something savory and comforting. I found an awesome recipe online and whipped up a turkey noodle soup in less than 30 min with prep work, waiting for pressure to rise, waiting for the soup to cook (noodles and all) and pressure release. The soup had a 7 minute manual cook time! Incredible.The instant pot came in a super sturdy box and was easy to unpack. The device is well made and from what I read is probably safer than a regular pressure cooker. I washed it and followed the instructions in making sure it was working properly. Easy as pie.I'm instantly in love with the instant pot. I'm so excited to make more fun recipes. I'd recommend buying yourself one... It'll pay for itself in time alone."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've only used it a few times, but it's a lot of fun when I do!  It's pretty cool how it works.  I've cooked eggs (though I found out that the 5 min. that is standard when you press the ""egg"" cook button is too long.  Mine turned out with a dark edge around the yolk.  Next time I'll try 3 or 4 minutes.  I've also baked potatoes which turned out great.  I bought the steamer basket and the egg shelves.  Haven't had a chance to use it much since I've gotten it, but I know it will give me years of enjoyment. It seems very well made, easy to use and wash.  I recommend it."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I am a life long pressure cooker and canner. I have several varieties of stove top PC and one other electric one. I by far like this 6qt instant pot the best. Its the perfect size for 4 or more people. I often use it for pitchin things so it holds more than enough. I am glad the popularity of pressure cooking has come back into fashion. But after viewing many ip sites and fb pages just keep in mind not everything can or has to be made in this. The art of cooking is knowing, in part, what tool best suits the needs."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased this really on a lark. I needed an extra crock pot for Thanksgiving. I heard about the Instant Pot but didn't have a clue what it was about. Well the day after Thanksgiving it was on sale and I thought I would give it a go. All I can say is WOW!  Since I've recieved it I've used it everyday!  Steel cut oats in the morning, spaghetti for dinner, clam chowder, baked potatoes plus alot more. My next ""project"" is yogurt.  There are some great videos on YouTube. There is a Facebook group as well.  All kinds of recipes are available on the web. I can't say enough good things about it. Read the manual, watch the videos and I promise you this will become your go to kitchen appliance. My wife loves it since I do all the cooking.  I even ordered one for both of my daughters for Christmas!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I started hearing about the Instant Pot a few months ago. Upon learning it was a pressure cooker (because I had no clue ya'll) I sort of freaked out. What if I blew up the kitchen? Well, nothing that dramatic has happened although I did end up with some soup spraying out the release nozzle once. What is my favorite feature? The manual button honestly. I use it most of the time so far. The other night I came to the realization that I hadn't taken anything out for dinner. Uh oh. But, I was able to put frozen chicken breasts, seasonings, and salsa verde together and within 25 minutes we had a delicious Salsa Verde Chicken. I shredded it and served it over rice. It was so delicious. So, if you tend to forget you need to cook dinner every night like I apparently do, this is an amazing tool. I am also looking forward to using the yogurt button on this because I have heard amazing things about it. I suggest you join some groups on Facebook so you can learn from others using the IP. Happy Cooking!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love our Instant Pot. It's a little daunting to figure out how to use at first, but once you get the basics down, it's our most used small appliance. We regularly make oatmeal, rice and steamed vegetables . Even hard boiled eggs, which are a dream to peel versus the mess I usually make when I boil them on the stove. I ended up buying one for my 74 year old mother whose old-school pressure cooker died on her.  Worth the investment!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,I really thought I loved my crockpot but this thing can do so much more! I made spaghetti in 13 minutes! All in this pot. No boiling water. This thing is amazing. It is intimidating at first but now that I’ve used a few times I can’t say enough good things. It’s a little confusing at first but the safety part and release features are what intimated me. Once I used them I got more comfortable. Just making sure your hand is not directly on top of the release valve when you manually release. It came with a recipe book but I’ve been looking online for ones that I like better. You will have so much fun with this thing.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love, love, love it.  I debated for a long time before investing.  I already owned a slow cooker, and a rice cooker.  I didn't see the need for yet another small appliance.  I use this EVERYDAY.I joined Eat at Home meal plan to try to save some money and eat healthier.  This is the perfect companion. (Obviously, I am still working on the saving money part when I am paying someone to plan my food and buying an Instant Pot.) I have been making soups with dried beans, and when I did not put on enough time, a couple of button clicks and I can pressure cook and finish quickly - soft beans - what a concept. I also use the delay timer, and the auto shut off.  I am saving money by not buying a ""replacement dinner"" (e.g., pizza) because I over cook or under cook dinner with my old slow cooker."
1.0 out of 5 stars,"I loved the results I got with this, but after using it a few times, the non-stick coating started flaking off the basket. I contacted the company, but they said they don't have just the baskets to replace mine and don't anticipate getting them any time soon. Since I don't want to risk the coating getting into my food, I have stopped using it, and I'm past the window of returning it through Amazon. I'll have to throw the whole thing away and buy a different kind of air fryer. I think one with a pull out drawer might be easier to use anyway. It's really clunky taking off the heavy lid and setting it aside when the food needs to be turned. Also, the capacity of this one is cramped, even when cooking for two people."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This has made my cooking life so much easier! I love having dinner on the table in no time - especially when I didn't pre-plan or prepare in advance for a meal. I've been able to convert some of my regular recipes to IP times too. For Christmas dinner, I made a traditional German Sauerbraten that would have taken hours on the stove top in 1 hour and 10 mins for a 6 lb top round roast. It came out falling apart tender and juicy. Worth every penny I spent on it!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Wow is all I can say.  On Thanksgiving, we made a pot roast to go along with the other dishes, but we started late and so we didn’t get to eat it until late. It took 8 hours, but it was worth it.  The next day, I ordered this Instant Pot, which was on sale for $105 for Black Friday.  It arrived Monday, but I also saw that the price dropped to $80 for Cyber Monday! I called Amazon and they actually gave me an adjustment because I was within the return period.The very first dish I made was the same pot roast, but instead of 8 hours, it took 60 minutes! I was a little skeptical, but after the 60 minute cook time, 10 minute natural release and then quick release, I stuck my tongs into the Instant Pot and to my surprise the meat just fell apart! I wish I’d ordered it the week before Thanksgiving instead of after! But if I had I wouldn’t have scored such an amazing deal...Anyway, if you’re looking to completely change the game in the kitchen, get the Instant Pot!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I’ve heard others raving for the past few years but didn’t bite until I decided to eat a more plant based diet and wanted the pressure cooker to help lower lectins in beans. I LOVE this appliance! It truly is a slow cooker, pressure cooker, rice cooker, and more with the sauté function. The only setting I’ve not tried is the yogurt maker. It extremely easy to clean and I use it almost daily. It has freed up space and relaced my crock pot, rice cooker."
3.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought this for our RV; there are only 2 of us and this seems to be a good size for 1 meal and easy storage. I have plenty of experience with stovetop pressure cookers, slow cookers, etc. This is a good amalgam of numerous devices, although there are lot of different opinion of how much liquid is required for pressure cooking. The manual is clearly wrong, way too much liquid. In the end, I won't use all of the programs and they are a waste. I would rather just have simple buttons to set mode and time."
3.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought this for my wife because here sister got one and raved about it.  So far I have not been impressed with the recipes that are giving this pot such a great reputation.  Yogurt is a hit or miss, stuffed cabbage ended up in the garbage but the cheese cake seems to work well.  Our pork chop meal was OK but nothing to rave about.  So far I see this as just another wheel in a different package.  I hate to see my wife so frustrated in the learning curve but I will still give it 3 stars for effort.  I hope I can give a better review when the learning curve is passed it's ramp up stage.  The overall use and cleanup seems to be reasonable.  Getting extra cover rings is a good idea.  Strong food smells seem to stay in the ring."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This thing has completely changed my life.I'm a slow cooker addict. No joke, I own 7 of them. I love hearty meals... roasts, stews, etc, so my slow cookers have been my BFF for years.Only problem is that I stink at planning. I won't lie, there have been so many days that I meant to cook, but by the time I made it to the store, it was after noon and I had an 8 hour meal planned.I was afraid to try this thing... but after weeks of searching out recipes, I gave in. After 1 meal, I was obsessed... I tried my beef stew. It takes me 8 hours in the slow cooker. After 45 minutes, we were sitting down to a delicious meal! I wasn't sure how the meat would cook, but it was PERFECT!We recently went through a 30 day diet... (not sure I'm allowed to say the name!) After searching the internet, I was able to make 30 compliant meals.... 22 of them were made with my Instant Pot! There's no way my slow cookers would have worked... most of the ingredients for those meals were purchased just a couple of hours before dinner!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,Product is durable & well worth the investment. Family was amazed as I was & meal time was cut in half for a hectic family schedule! Thank you!*UPDATE* 1 week after PURCHASE & Cook bookFamily wanted Caribbean dinner - Salmon was FULLY COOKED in 6 mins TOTAL! NO fish smell in house & everyone including chef (me myself & I) was happy!Every family should OWN ONE especially for after school & late activities! Clean up is a breezeWill NOT be disappointed.
1.0 out of 5 stars,"This item smells very weird like a metal, plastic or chemical.  I tried to cook 2 times and same smell. Can’t use this. Not sure if the seller accepts the returns, I don’t see return option in Amazon my orders section. Well I might have to throw this to garbage."
3.0 out of 5 stars,"I has a 6 qt Pressure Cooker XL which after replacing the pot insert with one from Instant Pot, I thought I would order an 8 qt Instant Pot. I can make chili and corn chowder in the XL with no problem, but when I do it in the Instant Pot is always says burn. So I cook larger piece of meat in the instant pot and use the XL for everything else. Not as happy with it as I thought I would be. I got it mostly for the yogurt maker, but that is an art in itself."
3.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought this to replace two appliances. After two expensive, failed slow cooker roasts, I actually decided to return it. Then I read numerous reviews stating it does NOT function well as a slow cooker. Times need adjusting, temp settings are not the same as a typical slow cooker. Hence the three stars. But as a pressure cooker, it's awesome and versatile. So I got rid of the pressure cooker with the top that jiggles and sizzles, and this is my new one. I love it."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Got this during Black Friday, have used it a total of three times since that time. Making ribs each time (have a few other recipes on the list to try next) and have to say this is my new favorite appliance in the house. Ordered when I was tired so did not realize this was the 8 quart size, so the price we paid made this an even greater deal than I would have originally thought.Can't wait to try some of the other recipes I have found in it, word to the wise, if you have an android or iOS device download the Instant Pot app, there are a lot of really good recipes in there that turn out really really good."
1.0 out of 5 stars,"I am very upset.  I ordered this Instant Pot Duo Plus 60 6qt June 5th for a late Mother’s Day present for my mother.  Due to her being a senior citizen I thought this would be a great cooking tool for her to eliminate pots and time.  She just opened up the package today for the first time (a senior that takes time getting to things) and when she opens it she sees scratches and water spots and residue/film on the lid.  The first thing she did was call me on her phone and say “Steven, did you know you ordered a used Instant Pot”? I said what!? Than she procedes to show me everything.  I spent just shy of $100 before spending another $40+ on accessories to be delivered a returned used product.  I am extremely frustrated."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This has become my go to pressure cooker for my husband and myself.  It is the perfect size.  I have a larger one, but this is perfect for two people.  Whenever I have company, I usually make my rice in this one (if that is what I am serving) and a main meal in the other one.  I bought this for the yogurt feature which works perfectly.  I am lactose intolerant and can't have most yogurts sold in grocery stores.  I was going to purchase a yogurt maker and then  spotted that the price for a yogurt maker and this were about the same...so I went with this for its versatility.  Happy camper here.  :-)"
4.0 out of 5 stars,"An excellent pressure cooker, and I've used pressure cookers for years.  The saute feature is very nice, but I really only use that on small things (browning garlic, or a single onion).  I brown bigger items in a cast iron pan on an induction burner, much quicker.  The ease of setting this pressure cooker is good enough that my wife will use it, without the fear she has of the stove top pressure cooker.  As a slow cooker it leaves a lot to be desired; if there was a thick walled ceramic insert that could only use a glass lid, then this might work, but the stainless steel insert just pales in comparison to even th e cheapest slow cooker crock."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"So many fun recipes to try.This is so easy to use and I was intimidated at first, but it's easy to figure out.Please note that the steam valve is wiggly, it is supposed to be, I had to call a friend to ask about this as I thought my pot was defective!  Once you turn it to seal, it really will be sealed, then it's easy to use a wooden spoon to move it.  If it wasn't wiggly, you'd get burned trying to undo the pressure valve.  Before you release the pressure, turn the pot so the valve is not under your cabinets.  It will release steam, spit a little water etc.  It's makes a loud hissing, so my dogs aren't fans LOL.Another thing is that the sealing ring absorbs smells from your food.  I have seen suggestions to have multiple rings for different food types.  I think I will do this. My sealing ring smells like honey garlic chickenI am so glad I went for it and bought one."
5.0 out of 5 stars,My sister got one for Mother's Day and she told me it was the best gift she had ever gotten. They've used it everyday. So I got one and we've used it and it was great. I learned midday that my niece was sick so I wanted to make them some chicken vegetable and rice soup. I wouldn't have had time if it weren't for the InstantPot. I was able to make the best chicken soup I've ever made and that was just the second time I used the pot so the learning curve wasn't bad. My first dish was meatloaf and potatoes and that went without a hitch too.
1.0 out of 5 stars,"This pot seems to be a fine pressure cooker. The selling point for me was being able to pressure cook and slow cook in the same pot I Tried using slow cook function twice since I bought the item. Even on slow cook “more” setting(Highest available) the liquid in the pot hardly gets warm. You can comfortably put your finger in the cooking liquid even after hours of “slow cooking”. I Wanted to return the item but amazon says the return window closed October 29th. Oh well, guess I wasted $180."
1.0 out of 5 stars,"Edit! My lid began working again. Idk why it wouldn’t work one day but it is going and haven’t had a problem since. We full time RV around the USA and I love having IP pressure cooker and air fry lid due to limited space! I love it!Original post: Ordered February 22, 2020. Today is May 13 and it has stopped working. Worked great up until today. Will not allow me to air fry or do anything however when plugged in it is on. Very disappointed"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I wasn't sure about using a pressure cooker after all the warnings my grandmother gave me about them, but after reading the reviews thoroughly and watching a video on how safe the electric cookers are, I took the leap. But I still expected meats to turn out rubbery. Not true. My first use of this was with boneless chicken breasts, browned in the cooker first, with a jar of blackberry brandy jelly I bought at a Farmers Market. I pushed the button to start it going, and ran :-) The unit didn't make a sound or a jiggle or shoot out threatening steam, and within twelve minutes dinner was ready. But I wasn't ready for how tender the chicken was (not rubbery at all) and how the flavor of the jelly had intensified rather than turning bland as often happens with slow cooking. Clean-up was a breeze, the kitchen stayed cool, and I couldn't be happier. I also got a few books to help me get used to this new/old way of cooking and look forward to making everything from yogurt to desert."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought it for my lovely wife and she absolutely loves it! She used it tonight to make Chicken Parmesan Penne (I think that's how you spell it!?!). It was delicious and thanks to Instant Pot Dou 80, she was able to cook dinner from start to table in less than 30 minutes. Normally this meal from start to finish is at least an hour. The Instant Pot Duo 80 also has a saute feature which is very convenient. The pasta was also cooked to the perfect amount of tenderness. It only took about 10 minutes to cook the pasta noodles. We cooked the noodles in the pot with everything else, no boiling the pasta and then draining it to dump it into another dish to finish. We only had one pot to clean as well. We were also pleased with how easy it was to clean.No, Instant Pot Duo 80 did not pay me to write this (I wouldn't be upset if they did ""hint hint"") but it seems like a very well built appliance. Would definitely recommend this to my friends!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm in love with this pot. To be truthful I was afraid to use it the first time. My memories of ""pressure cookers"" are of the day one exploded and food was all over the kitchen. The Instant Pot is a welcome relief. The first thing I cooked was hard boiled eggs- a perfect success!!! All of them were cooked to perfection. After not destroying the kitchen, I made chicken. It was frozen and still came out tender and tasty. I did find it a little difficult to find directions on how to cook chicken without a specific recipe. I did finally find directions on line and was very happy with the result. The ""cookbook"" that came with it is not the best. Thankfully there are  hundreds of tips and recipes on line. I highly recommend this pot."
1.0 out of 5 stars,"My 10 quart Instant Pot Duo Nova was delivered on May 6th. I opened, washed the inner pieces and did the 5 minute water test on it, which worked fine.I used it for cooking the first time, yesterday, May 15th to cook a whole chicken. Worked great! When I went to make chicken stock from covering the chicken bones with water (staying under the 2/3 fill line), at some point in the process it stopped working. The next time I went to check on it, the power display was black and it wasn’t on and won’t turn on."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Cooking is so much easier and faster with this thing, less mess and only one pot to clean! I wish it came with a cooking book to learn more recipes. Im going to have to order one."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is the second instant pot I've purchased; the first was for myself - this one was a gift (for a large household, always feeding at least four adults). The easy ability to throw stuff in the pot, and basically forget about it until it beeps at you is amazing. The versatility is great too, since it's also a rice cooker, slow cooker, etc. It also makes meal prep a breeze since it cooks things in a fraction of the time. Strongly recommend it to everyone."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I haven't used it long enough to really make a  good judgement, but I am having a good time with  trial and error.  I am 87 and used the old fashioned pressure cooker years ago, but this is more fun. I just wish I could  nail down the cooking times on a lot of  items I want to cook. It leaves too much guess work, and I don't personally care for steamed cake and muffins, but am dying to  try the cheesecake. I also think it would be nice to include a few recipes with the pot, some pots come with a recipe book and some such as mine does not. Wonder why that is?"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Still learning how to use it for all of recipes that I like but am very happy with it. They seem to be improving on all of their models regularly and that means that mine will be old in no time. But they are so well made and versatile I don't think that will be a problem.Really like for the pressure cooking feature, the price of meat has skyrocketed and so buying less expensive but tougher cuts of beef can be used where they weren't before.Very Happy, get one for yourself."
5.0 out of 5 stars,This is a great little product. It is the smallest in their lines and I use it to make yogurt rice and oatmeal. Super deal for a super product.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"After recently having a baby, I've loved having this. Couple things to keep in mind: it does take some time to pressurize so meals take a bit longer (you have to wait for the pressure to build then it starts the cook time). Also, the venting knob is a bit scary, I'd never use my hand to switch it over from sealing to venting as the steam comes roaring out like a steam engine. I usually use a spatula to turn it over so I don't get burned. Been a few times we thought we burned the bottom of the pot, but it always came off easily when cleaning. Would definitely recommend for busy families."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Very happy with my new Instant Pot. So far everything I have made it it has been great.It will be a real time saver when I want to make a roast, soup, stew or various other dishes.I was very impressed with how the hard boiled eggs turned out, cooked perfectly, not over done, and they peeled like a dream with no shell sticking to the white.I also like that this is not as big as my large oval crockpot, it's easier to have set up on the counter.I do wish that the recipe book that came with it had more recipes, but there are many websites to find ideas.It was shipped quickly and packed well.The six quart is plenty big for my family, if I had a large family I would probably want the larger size.So far I have used the pressure setting and the sauté feature, I have not used the slow cooker."
5.0 out of 5 stars,This thing is magic I bought it for my mom and she was upset she said it’s not the same as the pressure cook that’s a stove top. Well let me just say I buy her a lot of stuff this was the first time she tells me that it was the best gift I got her for the kitchen. Mom loves it and it’s super easy to use if you read the directions. Cooked lamb shanks and man let me tell you the flavor was amazing the meat was falling off the bone
5.0 out of 5 stars,I was hesitant on getting another kitchen gadget. Even after I had so many friends and family members who loved it. But now I am sold! This thing is amazing. The fact that I can cook meat from frozen and beans from dry without soaking makes it worth the money. I now no longer have to order out because I forgot to defrost meat. Love it! It is also super safe. So don't be scared! Just order it. You wont regret it.
1.0 out of 5 stars,"When I made my first potroast, I couldn't believe how tough it was. No way was it falling apart as my friend's did. I followed all instructions and it was almost inedible.  OK, so today I tried a whole chicken.  Followed recipe exactly and half of the breast was done and the rest of the chicken was not done.  This is a defective pot which does not pressurize properly.  I'm sure of it. I'm returning it."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"We absolutely love our Instant Pot.  There's not much more I can say that hasn't been said in the 12,000 prior glowing reviews, but I still wanted to confirm what everyone says.  I had not seen a pressure cooker in a kitchen since mother's many decades ago-- a fascinatingly noisy, steamy and potentially dangerous contraption.  Instant Pot is quiet, clean and safe as I could hope for.I often forget its proper name and call it ""Magic Pot,"" because I am amazed that in such a short time, liters of healthy satisfying soup will emerge from the ingredients with little-to-no added water or stock.  That rich flavorful Stews come from seemingly no-where.  That rice porridge, traditionally cooked for hours on end, just seem to materialize creamy and flavorful as if by Magic.We got ours at a great price during a Amazon recent sale-- almost everyone in our circle of friends got one too at that time.  Our Canadian ""cousins"" are really helping our cooking to Take Off, Eh!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"My son is a chef and told me he uses his Instant Pot regularly. He likes his so much he bought one for me during the Black Friday sale. I have used it almost every day since it arrived, making a perfect roast, butternut squash soup, pumpkin for puree, chick peas for hummus...there are countless recipes online and an Instant Pot app that helps me find recipes and shop for ingredients. I was always afraid of pressure cooking. This is fool proof and safe. Absolutely love it!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Never cooked in college - hated washing dishes.Someone recommended the instant pot to me since I am not a very good cook, and hardly make time to cook. I've had this product for only a month and I can say my skills and interest in the kitchen have grown substantially.This instant pot has opened up my eyes to a whole new level of cooking. The recipes online are so easy to follow and the fact that I only have to wash a couple dishes + utensils is amazing! I feel like I can cook anything with this machine. I've even looked up how to make traditional filipino dishes (and there are recipes out there!)"
4.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought this Insta pot when it was on sale. I ended up not opening it until a month later. By that time the return window had closed. When I opened up the package I discovered there was a huge dent in the outside of the Instapot. Since it was on the outside, it still functions fine, but I am very disappointed in Amazon’s quality control. Sure enough, when I looked back at the reviews I was not the only one who received a park with similar damage. As far as the Insta pot is concerned it’s a wonderful product"
1.0 out of 5 stars,"This is the third Duo Nova I’ve purchased in the past couple months and each one fails within the first 1-2 uses. It will show “food burn” during the initial 3 cup water-only test and you’ll smell melting plastic. Then if it doesn’t outright fail then, it will when you get 15mins into cooking something. What will happen is that it just dies and won’t come back to life. I had read that the issue was the temperature-based fuse but after taking the trouble to solder in a replacement higher-temp fuse it still died upon the first use. I’m now convinced that this is a defective model that they need to recall."
5.0 out of 5 stars,I purchased the mini pot and it is plenty big enough for 3-4 people.  I’m still learning how to use it but it very quick with easy clean up.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have a very small apartment and closet size kitchen, no counter space. My Instant Pot and my coffee pot reside on my counters, nothing else. I love the air fryer lid as it allows me to use an air fryer without taking up more space on my counter. As for how it works, another 5 stars! I have made salmon (I'll never go back to oven or pan searing again!), different roasted veggies such as broccoli, squash, Brussels sprouts - DELISH! I also made beet chips, they were amazing!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Well, i had a smaller instant pot before this and loved it. I decided to get a bigger size and give my smaller one away. I regret that so much. This one always gives me a burn notification and my other one never did this. If you have an older one that doesn’t constantly turn off with a burn notice, keep it, i am not happy with this purchase.I am updating this review because i did call Instant Pot directly and they replaced my Instant Pot right away. The new one works perfectly."
1.0 out of 5 stars,"I was loving it until it stopped heating up fully. At first I thought there was something wrong with the way I was using it but no, even when it says ""Hot"" - it's not. I would guess it operates at about 1/3 power now. Won't saute even small pieces of meat and won't come up to pressure to pressure cook. Too late to return it. Instant Pot support is a crock. I'm not sure there is anyone actually there. Don't waste your money on any Instant Pot product. I wasted mine so you don't have to. Anyone want to buy accessories or spare parts?"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I am glad I got this one. My mom got the previous version and it is good too. I like my Ninja Foodi with the Air Crisper better, but I often use them at the same time and this is still great. If I am at my mom's we just finish off the meals under the broiler in the oven and that works. I just try not to turn on my oven if I don't have to because it takes SO LONG to cool down. Rice is so good - I use Chicken stock and basically soy sauce with just a little water and the rice is amazing!"
1.0 out of 5 stars,"Returned item before use, decided lid was to heavy for a short 76yr old and don't often fry food anyway.  It look well made and sorry it was not right for me.  It came on time and was well packaged would would recommend it for any who eat fried food already use their insta pot often."
3.0 out of 5 stars,"I am returning this item due to not being able to get rid of the smell of what I cooked from the gasket seal.  I soaked it in vinegar for over an hour and it still smelled of the pot roast spices so I am thinking it might harbor bacteria.  I did like the stainless steel insert.  I put in a totally frozen piece of rump roast and pressure cooked it for like an hour, even tho my temp gauge read 200 degrees it was still a little tough so I programmed it to cook for 9 hrs on slow cook mode.  The next morning it was tender.  So I am thinking I could have done this in my slow cooker I paid $35-$40 for.  I like the little beeps that is made that signaled that you were locking and unlocking the lid."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I'd first heard about the Instant Pot from my friends on Facebook so I ordered this when it was on sale. I left it unopened for a few months because I was moving. After I unpacked it I still left it sitting there until I could muster up the courage to try it. My fiance and I are not cooks and we tend to order takeout everyday, especially since we both work 7 days a week. I bought fresh chicken thighs and produce and waited another week before I had time. Finally, I dumped everything in, sauteed a few seconds, then pressed the ""poultry"" button and had fully cooked, tender, juicy chicken, with veggies and mushrooms. I'd even rested a Pyrex glass container with rice and water (1:1) on the included metal rack above the chicken and had perfect fluffy rice at the same time.I'd first cooked 4 chicken thighs and the second time doubled the amount and everything still cooked at the same amount of time. I'd recall roasting chicken thighs in the past for more than half an hour and still having to worry about the inside being raw. I can't wait to try other recipes!  I'm going to text my concerned fiance's mother pictures of my creation and she will be so proud. She's constantly worried about all the fast unhealthy food we're eating.I ordered another Instant Pot during Black Friday and will gift it this Christmas."
3.0 out of 5 stars,"Even though it’s intimidating at first, it’s not that hard to use. I ordered one for my husband and one for my parents, for Christmas. The description says it comes with a rice paddle, soup spoon, and measuring cup. Sadly, that is not true because neither of us got those items. I’m disappointed in a big company not realizing they are offering items that don’t actually come with the item. For that reason I’m giving two stars. I added a pic of the screenshot I took when I ordered these. I highlighted where it said it came with those additional items."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have this 3 quart and the 6 quart both.  After 3 years, this little one is still rock solid and many times, (like this morning) I have both going at the same time.  Highly recommend this for yogurt, side dishes or small family meals."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"Final diagnosis on instapot-Pros- it's like a totally sped up version of crockpot. Things that take hours take less than 1 hour- most things under 30 mins.Haven't made a terrible meal yet. LolHas a saute setting so you dont gave to dirty extra pans cooking something else then putting it in, you cook it all in the potCons- when it says things like make potatoes in 10 min= not true. It takes time to bring pot to temp cook it then cool it down. Still a lot load faster than without it, but not a miracle.Things can burn- hasn't happened to me yet though thank heaven.Overall I'm pretty sure I like it. Has been super helpful with having kids. So basically you can plan ahead and do it crockpot style or just wait til end of the day and do it."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"After many recommendations for this appliance I finally purchased one. Now I understand what all the rave reviews were about. It felt a little intimidating at first but the directions were clear and we tried out a few easy things first. I cannot get over having a full meal ready so quickly. One of our first was a roast. Typically I do this in the crockpot but was able to sear, cook the meat, then the potatoes, and make the gravy all in the same pan in very minimal time. We are a busy family with four small kids and time is a hot commodity. Cooking good food quickly and only one pan to wash is a huge perk. I have done chicken stock multiple times as we use/drink this often. Very quick and easy. Only complaint would be the recipe book being of little relevance for our family but I have found many recipes online so this has not been an issue. So nice to not need so many appliances and it has done everything I have wanted. Love it!!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I had been meaning to get an Instant Pot since all my friends use it and are praising the efficiency and ease of cooking. After looking at reviews, this seemed like the best option both within my budget as well as features. I have made soups, chilli, rice, and one pot pasta dishes. It really is versatile and has everything I was looking for. It is also easy to clean. I'm looking forward to making more yummy dishes in this Instant Pot. 👍"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I like this better for rice than a rice cooker!  Also great for making beans from dried beans.  Versatile and easy to use.  Stainless steel insert has no teflon, which is great.  Good size for 2-3 people."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Was hesitant to purchase an Insta Pot.  Saw so many negative reviews from people who tried and didn't like,  but I thought why not, I will try and see how I feel.  I wanted a new crock pot - mine was 30 years old - and decided to get a new crock/insta pot in one.  I love it!  I've used as slow cooker a few times, nothing special about it but it gets the job done.  The Insta pot feature, however, is awesome.  Takes a little getting used to all the directions and different ways to cook things, but it's well worth it.  We love how roasts and meats come out so tender and flavorful.  I have not used as a rice cooker or to make yogurt.  I've only had a month and have used several times.  Clean up is easy.  It cooks quickly.  It just takes some time getting used to using it without fear of doing it wrong."

5.0 out of 5 stars,I was a chef for 20 years. I never used a pressure cooker. I drive for a living now and I bought this to cook in my truck. Alas it was not meant to be because the power requirements are a little to high for my current setup. However it does get a lot of use on the weekends. I prepare meals that I then portion and vacuum seal then freeze for the upcoming week. I have cooked a 6lb MOJO pork shoulder in 90 minutes in this thing. That normally takes 7-10 hours. Any roast takes on average 60-90 minutes. You can fully cook potatoes in 10 min without cutting them. In addition you can saute in this before pressure cooking so that the pot retains the flavor of the browned bits on the bottom. This has become my new favorite item in my kitchen and I'm kicking myself for not buying one sooner.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Instant Pot is all the rage.And with good reason.My reason for choosing Instant Pot is the stainless inner pot and lid lining. (Not a fan of nonstick finishes- they wear out and flake and have to be replaced- stainless is pretty much forever.)Yes, a pressure cooker cooks more quickly- but you need to factor in time for building pressure before and releasing pressure after. It's not magic, but it is pretty close. Instant Pot maintains a Facebook page to provide customer support along with 800# support.And, yes, there is definitely a learning curve.BUT there is also cheesecake. Incredible cheesecake. Just the cheesecake makes the Instant Pot a worthwhile purchase! ;)"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've always cooked from scratch and this Instant Pot cuts down on the time ten-fold. I only wish I had it when I worked. I've made things from roasts, bbq ribs, chili, cinnamon rolls, cheesecakes, applesauce and much more.After 8 months of continuous use, I got the dreaded C 6L error. I contacted the company and they were to ship me a new one. It took them a month but I did get a replacement and I'm very happy. I hope this one lasts much longer.Since I've had mine, I brag it up to friends, family and even strangers in the store that are looking at them. So far, 6 people I know have purchased one because of me talking about it. It's wonderful!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"The ease of the instructions and setup.  I have been known to blow things up, but this cooked magnificently the roast and then the vegetables.  Nothing was burned, nothing was cooked to mush and the ease of clean-up was appreciated.  My husband and dinner guests were generous in their compliments.  ( I wished I had had one when I last had company for dinner.)  I recommend this 3 qt pressure cooker, slow cooker without qualifications."
5.0 out of 5 stars,Cooking has become so easy since I bought this. Hands on cooking time is greatly reduced and I have figured out how to use this for dry cokked things for which I had to earlier spend a while on stove- checking and rechecking. Love the delay start feature.Earlier I had trouble many times closing the lid properly which would make the handle hot and water would evaporate out of the pot. I since then figured it was because of the gasket inside the lid not being in place.I LOVE this pot. Hope it works for a long time for us.

I’ve received items for addresses one digit higher than mine, one a digit lower and once five digits lower. That one was of medical supplies packed in dry ice. The person it was meant for has a physical disability, and could not have tracked down the errant package. Had I not been home at an uncommon time, the contents might have gone bad."
5.0 out of 5 stars,I use my instapot just about everyday. It is small enough for one or two meals. It does not take up a large amount of space on my counter so I have room to meal prep.  I love that its small enough to store in cabinet when done. I bought another pot to multi cook meals.
5.0 out of 5 stars,I didn’t get the Instant Pot hype before I got one a gift. It’s such a game changer. Not only was I able to get rid of my rice cooker and crockpot (using a smaller storage footprint). I also cut down on cooking length of time and energy consumption. I also now have containers in my fridge of cooked items I can use to toss together a salad or a little something to eat. I can buy beans and multi grains in bulk and cook them without them being hard or taking too long. So this also cuts down on container waste! Love it!!!!
5.0 out of 5 stars,"We've had this for just over a week, and I've been cooking in it nearly every day. It has revolutionized my home cooking, and already it is is saving us money. So far I've used it to cook a whole chicken (twice), to cook a pork roast for carnitas, to cook 4 different kinds of dry beans, and to make brown rice and two different types of white rice. Everything has turned out wonderfully. The Instant Pot is extremely easy to use, and the insert is very easy to clean. Suddenly I've lost my urge to eat out -- why leave the house to eat when I can make a delicious, FAST, inexpensive meal at home in the Instant Pot? My cajun red beans & rice with andouille sausage used to take 4 hours to make. Now it takes under an hour, and turns out just as perfectly. This is the best kitchen-related purchase we've made in years."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I originally bought this just to use pressure cooking as I'm forgetful and most times forget to defrost stuff that would need hours to cook. It has helped me save A LOT of time when making beef/pork stew, ribs etc.  I have made country style ribs in this and it was awesome being able to make fall off the bone ribs in half an hour! Also made yogurt and it was not hard at all.  Still learning the rice cooking method (still comes out a bit mushy) but thats an issue on my part.  Definitely would recommend this for anyone who is short on time and want to save some space in the cabinets."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"If 6 stars were possible I'd given them.  This product has changed my cooking life forever.  Makes the BEST babyback ribs ever, cooked in apple cider and finished of with BBQ sauce in the oven for 10 minutes.  They fall off the bone.Can take frozen meat directly from freezer with a small amount of liquid and defrost on no time.  My microwave died and I tried this.  It didn't dry put the meat, it didn't get those funky tough edges like when you defrost in microwave.Makes amazing Mac and cheese in 8 minutes.Make awesome dried beans into soup without soaking.Love the sauté function when I'm making spaghetti sauce from scratch.Makes perfect jasmine rice...every time.Stainless insert pot is super easy to clean and shines up like brand new.  Nice size for dishwasher.I would love to give everyone in my family one for Chriatmas.  Cookbook that comes with it is so-so.Lots of great You tube videos out there to help you get started, but a great Facebook group for sharing recipes and tips.This ain't your Grandma's scary pressure cooker.  Well done Instant Pot."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"After doing a ton of research on electric pressure cookers I decided to go with the Instant Pot and it's been nothing but pleasing and easy.  I know people say there's a 'learning curve' to these but I haven't experienced that.  I must admit, I'm not one to read manuals; I'd much rather watch the various videos out there.A big part of my decision, especially in not buying the XL one from infomercials, was the warranty.  Buyer beware of the warranty on the XL-it's only 60 days and on top of that you have to pay $24.99 shipping if you have to return it in those 60 days.  A lot of people have reported this infomercial company is hard to get a hold of and that's not cool!  Another factor was I saw many reviews about the XL and people reported chipping and peeling of the interior - stainless never chips/peels and I would be concerned if the coating was coming off into my food, with stainless I feel much safer.Getting back to the Instant Pot, I just received this on Friday and so far I've made the best Mac N Cheese, Chili, Beef Barley Soup, Baby Back Ribs and a creamed chicken recipe and they were all great.  I love the one-pot cooking, and easy clean-up.  If my stove/oven had a brain they might think they were retired!  One thing I need to mention is the size, the other one (XL) is 8qt and the Instant Pot is 6qt.  At first I was apprehensive about the 6qt size but I'm glad I went with the 6qt because I now think 8qt would have been too large.  Looking forward to so many more recipes and fun with this machine!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Simply obsessed!I originally received an item that had the entire bottom smashed to pieces, but Amazon’s return policy is best-in-class and I had my replacement shortly afterward.This IP is my first and so dang easy to use. It makes cooking for our family of 6 easy and quick. I no longer have to hate my life decisions when I forget to take out the meat for dinner, it cooks from frozen just as easily. Do NOT hesitate, just press add to cart (and actually check out lol)."
5.0 out of 5 stars,I have been shopping for an air fryer for awhile now. I've gone back and forth on several brands unsure of which one. I figured I would give this one  a try since I have an instant pot and 1 less kitchen appliance is a plus. I love love love this! It's super easy to use and the food comes out delicious! I am happy with this purchase and highly recommend.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I needed a replacement for my old stovetop pressure cooker, which had seen better days.  This unit is a little slower, but does a great job.  I haven't even begun to test the additional capabilities.  It cleans easily, but I can't get the smell of my last roast out of the unit.  It's not a bad smell, but the smell of cooked meat is always present, especially on the gasket.  Overall, I'm very pleased with it."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've had 3 different airfryers in the past and was never really happy with the results and with how little food I could fit in them. I just used this lid for the first time and I'm in love! I made chicken thighs (breaded in my own shake n' bake recipe) and they are just perfect!! The tray that comes with it has 2 levels, and I though that all pieces wouldn't cook the same way at the same time, but they did! I was also able to fit 6 thighs, 3 on each level. Very, very happy!"
1.0 out of 5 stars,"Excellent design, but terrible execution! I bought this I have to return a crockpot product similar to this. I like the design of this one so much better. It is intuitive And relatively easy to use. And it is so quiet when use it correctly.  It is so much superior than the other pressure cook I have in the house.  But it is either the Fabrication process that is terrible or the material used that is terrible.  No more the third or fourth time when I used it, I have noticed A rust spot at the heating surface, And there is almost like peeling effact inside the stainless steel pot.  At that spot, the surface is no longer smalls and shiny like the rest of the pot. None of this Defects  was very large, but I don’t think there should be any of such defects ct at all , especially given the fact that this product has been given so much publicity on Amazon as well as in the press.  Amazon is great by taking back the product. I am not giving up on this product just yet, because I like the design so much. I replaced it, with a new order . Hopefully second time it is a charm."
3.0 out of 5 stars,"I will update this review if I find myself using this more, but tried making some corn with pressure cook setting and it took forever to get up to temperature to cook the 3 cobs I put in there. I only put in 2 inches of water, so you would think it could bring that to a boil and up to cooking pressure quickly, but it took about 10mins and then you still have to wait for the corn to cook.My dumb pressure cooker on the stove can come up to pressure in less than 5mins and I can cook corn in no time.Anyway, we'll see how useful the other modes are."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Fast, of course. Also keep the nutrients in the pot! So easy to use and clean. I am eating better than ever & 100% vegetarian...  and i don't  like to cook! I have recommended the IP to my friends and they are very happy too! easy to modify and invent receipts. thousands are on line for anything I have searched. It is good to think of all the Farm animal lives this has saved. Steel-cut oats take 15 min total time, including prep. Took 2 hours in crock pot. And they are still firm, not mush. Love it!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This has seriously been a life saver!! I love all the different options and that you can cook things that would generally take lots of preparation and time very quickly. Some of my favorite things to make in this is FROZEN CHICKEN! Yup! No need to defrost for hours. Just dump in some chicken breasts with flavoring of your choice (salsa, BBQ sauce, etc) and turn it on. Cooks in about 15 minutes depending on your chicken size. Then you just shred and eat :) it's also very easy to make soups and stews and a quick baked potato in 15 minutes too! I have not tried to yogurt making feature yet but I'm definitely looking forward to that.It's also super easy to clean and the variety of different buttons makes it easy to cater the cooking as you need it"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I pressure cooked some beef bones for 50 minutes with the smallest amount of heat given off, and no noise, and no steam, and very little smell. Once I didn't put quite enough water in and it started to burn, and stopped heating and the readout said BURN (or maybe burned, i forget), so I pushed 'cancel' and the food was still okay (we ate it) and the pot was very easy to clean. It was easy enough to use the pressure cooking function without reading any instructions. Some of the other features might need some Instruction help. It needs a large cabinet."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Wow! I have really fallen in love with my Instant Pot. I use it at least 3 days a week to cook dinner. It's very easy to use, easy to clean up and cooks faster than most other methods.About once a week I cook a whole chicken in the Instant Pot. It comes out so tender and delicious. I stuff the bird with onions and celery, coat the outside with butter, sprinkle on some salt, pepper and season all. 27 minute cook time and enjoy."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"A little slower in cook and pressure release than my 4qt. Cook's Essentials, but uses the exact same counter space and gets the job done well. Also pleased with the stainless steel pot, which I didnt have before. Havent used all the features yet, but seems to be going well."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Saw this when it first came out and thought it was a hoax.  I steered clear of them for months.  However after working several double shifts I was almost desperate for a dinner solution that I could still get household things done while dinner was cooking.  I did a Ton of research,  talked to instant pot agents several times to make sure I bought the right pot for me.  I love this appliance! Unboxing is a bit overwhelming,  especially using it for the first time.  Not having ever used a pressure cooker I was scared to death.  I have managed to figure it out.  I've done hard boiled eggs,  breakfast steel cut oats,  chicken and potatoes..."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"A GREAT DEVICE.  We've used out Instant Pot several days every week for a year.  Convenient for rice and grains - even in small quantities for a meal for one or two adults.  Tough meats that require hours in a crock pot are soft and sweet in under an hour.  Add vegetables for ten more minutes for great stews.  We needed to replace the silicone seal after about nine months. Cheap and easy to buy on Amazon. We bought a second for us and at least one for each of our adult children.  They all seem to have been well made,  Not cheap but the convenience and all our cooking experiences support this as a terrific product."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"There's definitely a learning curve, even for sealing the lid.  It seems like a no-brainer design, but the first time we used it the lid never sealed properly.  No warning, and the indicators showed that it was heating and at pressure.  We were surprised when we pressed the steam release button nothing happened.When I removed the lid it looked like part of it had curled over.  I carefully removed & inserted the seal, and the next 2 times it worked perfectly.  Now we just need to experiment with tweaking the cook times according to the size of our meat.  Our corned beef was mostly amazing but could have cooked another 5 minutes.  Still, most of it was very tender after only 45 minutes of pressure time."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I was hesitant to get an IP at first,  I am stroke survivor so I had to have my hubby help me with learning it and was a bit intimidated at first but I am getting so used to using it now.  I have made egg bites, banana bread, roast, chicken, pasta etc!!  So far so good,  I really enjoy using it and with the heat of summer it keeps the kitchen from heating up!!"
3.0 out of 5 stars,"I really, REALLY wanted to love my Instant Pot... and I got a great holiday deal on it, so I was sure this would be a winner.  Sadly, I returned it... already had a rice cooker and crock pot, so I bought this hoping to make yogurt and meats/beans for quick dinners.  It is pretty bad at searing meat, or doing anything with meat other than turning it to mush (i.e., pulled pork, etc.).  If you want something browned, you'll need to put it in the oven under the broiler after cooking.  Not really a time saver.  It does the job of a lot of things slightly less well than each of those other items.  If you have a tiny kitchen with no room for anything except one appliance, this could help you out, but it's just not really the winner I thought it would be."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"How have i not reviewed this yet.  If you have any doubt, just do it.  We prepare at least four days a week in this.  In fact, we just made yogurt for the first time and will NEVER go back to store brand.  I can safely say I have used every function, have made sweet and savory, have purchased a glass lid as well as insert pans to do rice with the meat, to even more multitask an octopus of a machine to begin with.  HIGHLY recommend"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought this product to replace a dying rice cooker.  I intended to use this only to cook rice but ended up using the other functions as well.  I've made stir fried dishes, beef stew, chili, soups, etc.  It really is set and forget.  I can throw ingredients in and have a meal ready in an hour using the pressure cooking or I can set it to slow cook and have dinner cooking throughout the day while I'm at work. The presets really make it hard to mess anything up.  There is also a huge amount of information/recipes available online specifically tailored to using the instapot.  My only complaint is that when cooking rice it sticks to the bottom.  Cleaning however, is easy as cleaning any other pot.  I've recommended this product to all my friends and family."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love this Instant Pot.  It does the job of many of the small appliances I've amassed over the years.  I actually donated my crock pot and rice cooker to charity and now use this exclusively.  I was originally apprehensive about using a pressure cooker.  I heard the horror stories from my mom and grandmom from back in the 40s and 50s when they used the stove top style of pressure cooking.  Well, after one use I'm sold.  This post is safe, quick and makes those long cooked meals in a hurry.  I made a corned beef and cabbage dinner in under two hours.I've also used the slow cooker for beef barley soup and I've made rice.  Hint - go on line for the rice as there are so many varieties that the rice button may not always be the best choice to use.  Over all this is the best kitchen appliance I've made ever."
3.0 out of 5 stars,"Instant pot is a nice addition to the kitchen. Simply put it is a pressure cooker with a thin, quick heating internal pan and has many time selections for cooking.A regular steam cooker is normally a heavy metal container used over a gas fire and takes more time to get steam pressure built. Since prices are pretty even between the two choices, either ot is good for cooking. Being electric the Instant pot has the ability to keep food warm for many hours and can slow cook like a crock pot. So I guess that makes it a good choice overall but the timer controls seem too complicated."
2.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought it knowing I would use it a lot. It's fantastic the freedom to be able to cook almost everything.Pressure cookers are part of my culture, as in Brazil we do not live without beans. But here, in the US, there are not popular.It works great, it's easy to get ready, and reliable.But there are a lot of things I would change.And also I had a bad experience.First the glue used on the adhesive is annoying, the kind of you cannot clean well enough, specially the warning label on the lid top. Why use a glue so hard to get off?Then the burning lid. Forget it for one sec and get burned. It's 2017. Silicon. A X shaped plastic, anything. But that amount of free hot surface? It's to burn you.The bottom. That deserves a whole chapter. Everything is wrong. Oh, I hate the cable position. Could be lower, or at least, totally to one side or another. But it's 45°. Annoying. Connector in the bottom, 90° plug. Done.I had an accident with chickpeas. Cooking, overflowing, leaking. Yes, it leaks. Through the bottom. It's not a close pan. Under the inner pan, it's the heater element. Under it, access to the outside, to the electric parts. So if something leaks, goes directly o the electronic parts. There is no smart path, a drain, in the middle or corners, out of the way of the circuits in case of a leakage. If you pour water, for whatever reason, it goes straight to the electronic parts.So, never put more food or water than what is recommended. Good luck guessing if that food will increase a 1/4 or 1/2 in volume.It should have an emergency exist, a simple safe drain in the middle to exit the water, or even in case, like me, had to work clean the element. I saw my table full of water. And I couldn't believe it was from the pot!So, suggestions? Better materials on the lid, bottom, use silicone or expose less metal on the lid, put a drain, make the element cleanable, fix the awkward cable connector."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've never owned a pressure cooker. I was afraid of them. When a friend tole me she bought this one, I decided to try it, and I've never been happier with a purchase. I love beans - black beans, pinto beans, red beans - but they take 4-6 hours on the stove and just don't turn out right in the crock pot. So the first thing out of the box was a big bag of pinto beans. After soaking overnight, my beans were ready in less than 30 minutes, and they were perfect! I added in sauteed andouille sausage, onions, green peppers, and seasoning, and let them simmer in slow-cook mode for another hour and they were fantastic.The next day, I tackled a beef roast, and it was delicious in under an hour! the meat fell apart, and putting vegetables on top for 10 minutes after the meat was done made them perfect. I hate to cook and I'm absentminded. This is so easy to use even I can't screw it up. There's a simple valve to release the pressure, and you just put food in and push a button, for the most part. There are tons of recipes online. I'll be buying 2 or 3 more for Christmas gifts."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I couldn't love this Instant Pot more.  I had never used one and was a bit timid the first time I am so over that and am always experimenting with all the different features, now.  Sometimes I've used this twice in one day.  Definitely add this product to your weekly meal routine.  The biggest upside to it over my slow cooker is 1) you can use the pressure cooker feature w/ the addition of the ""keep warm"" feature which means you can pressure cook something first thing in the morning and head to work and it will on it's own switch over to the ""keep warm"" feature (145 to 172°F) when it's done for hours! 2) I like starting out w/ the pressure cooker feature and then switching over to the slow cooker feature on low.  3) Some people may not mind, but I work a lot from home and I find it nice not to smell what I'm cooking all day long.  The type of lid this pot has on it, keeps the smell in the pot!There's so many positives.  I would definitely recommend this product.  It truly is a favorite in my home!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Probably my favorite kitchen appliance ever!!!!!  I cannot say enough how much I LOVE my Instant Pot!!!  I have not used all of the functions on it yet (i.e., yogurt maker) but have sauteed, steamed, slow cooked, and pressure cooked.  I had no idea how much I would love having a pressure cooker in my life.  My husband and I bought 1/4 cow from a local farm and with that comes all different cuts of meat.  I don't typically buy tougher cuts of meat due to the long cooking process necessary in having the meat come out tender but this little baby can cook a perfect pot roast in 35 minutes!  Pulled pork?  Done! We even made chicken legs with it and they were fall-off-the-bone tender in 7 minutes.  Amazing!  If my house ever burns down, my Instant Pot will be the first thing I grab as I run out  :)"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have been petrified of pressure cookers since I was a kid.  Watching that little gauge with just a small bar which was to be in the center of the gauge as the whole thing rocked back and forth giving off steam and threatening to spray the entire pot's contents all over the kitchen from ceiling to floor.  Years later, my mother-in-law told me how her pressure cooker of beets literally did spray all over the kitchen and they had to repaint the kitchen!  So, here I am retired and I'm finally getting my first pressure cooker ever...and I LOVE it.  This particular item was very well reviewed and it literally has 10 safety features.  I read and highlighted the manual to be certain I understood how to operate it and off I went on my first pressure cooker adventure.  I made pork chops in gravy and they were delicious.  After I browned the chops, they cooked up in just 18 minutes.  The pressure cooker never made a sound other than the occasional soft click as the heating element clicked on or off.  I can't wait to try my next recipe.  YUM"
5.0 out of 5 stars,We love our Instant Pot. I used it quite a bit when we first got it. I got the 8qt because I wanted to make sure I had enough space to make larger meals. The first meal I made was a full rack of ribs and 3 full sized baked potatoes all at once. Everything fit and it all turned out great.We’ve had it for about 6 months now and lately we just use it on occasion but every meal we’ve ever made with it has been great. I have actually made almost all of the meals with it. My wife is afraid to use it still and thinks it’s too complicated. She still prefers to use the Crock Pot. Personally I like using the Instant Pot better since it is more versatile. I make a good chili in the Crock Pot and it was so much easier and faster in the Instant Pot.
2.0 out of 5 stars,"complete waste of money. Love my instant pot, wasted money when I bought the air fryer lid for it."
5.0 out of 5 stars,This isn't your Mother's pressure cooker. I wish I knew about these a long time ago but they don't advertise. It does most of the cooking functions I use all in 1 pot. I also have the 6qt but use this 3qt almost every day. Pressure up and natural release is faster than the 6qt. It's perfect for a 1 or 2 person family.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Previously I had a Cooks pressure cooker which was great and cooked meat in exactly 5 minutes.  However I would have to wait for the pressure to build up, then adjust the heat so the pressure regulator is not rocking too fast or slow, then set a timer so I know when to turn the flame off.  With the Instant Pot, the best thing is that once you close the lid you can forget about it and go about your day and the cooker will take care of itself.  I have cooked meat, rice, oats, beans in it so far.  I am not so sure about the usefulness of the function buttons since I noticed that in the Recipe book that came with the cooker the timings were all manually set. There is a bit of a learning curve when you are making your favorite dishes so you might want to test a few things before deciding what the best pressure and time is.  When I cook goat meat I use the Manual button and set the timer for 8 minutes and let it cool down naturally and the meat is quite tender.  For rice, I use a 1:1 rice to water ratio and set the timer for 3 minutes (on Manual function) and use the natural quick release (i.e waiting 10 minutes before releasing pressure through Venting).  I have found this to be the closest to making rice as it is made in a rice cooker. Overall it reduces the stress of having to stand at the kitchen stove and wait and watch for food to be done."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"The first time I used it I was following a recipe and all was going well until it said hit the ‘Manual’ button, imagine my shock when there was none! I called a friend who  explained to me that it was the Pressure button now. I was very nervous to use it but it only took that one time to get used to it and not be petrified of it. So far I made pork chops and then ribs, gotta say I will never have to buy ribs again! They were amazing, I cooked them on the rack provided instead of immersing in the broth. Love my instant pot! Oh and BTW  after reading the reviews I got the extended warranty from Amazon, apparently they break but it’s a risk I was willing to take in buying the pot because it’s worth it’s weight in gold"
5.0 out of 5 stars,I have two of this pots and use one of them at least every day. I love this pot and recommended it to my two co-workers. I have so many friends bought this pot and everybody enjoys to use the pot. I have used this pot to make Jiu Niang （fermented rice 酒酿）with Yogart low setting. Every time it turns out good result for 24 hours. I did find if I leave it for extra 8 hours without turning on pot that gives even better smell. I also use this pot to cook brown jasmine rice without pre soak. . Even my 96 year old mom enjoy to eat who did not eat brown rice before when I cooked with a regular electrical rice cooker. This pot gives very soft brown rice. I really appreciate the good design of this pot. I was luck to get this on sale for the price of $69.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I got this for a Christmas gift, and I love it!  I am going to love it even more come summer, when we can have good meals without heating up the entire house. So far the only problem I have had is in making yogurt. The first batch was inedible -- my fault -- the second batch perfect, and the third batch wouldn't set up. I thought maybe I hadn't heated it long enough and, why not, decided to heat it and put it into the InstaPot again. I ended up with cheese! I'm trying to figure out what I did wrong the third time, so I can add ""cheese-maker"" to my repertoire. I guess that makes my InstaPot an 8-in-1 though, LOL."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"You must get one of these! Changed the way I cook and eat. Healthy food is much quicker and convenient so I'm eating better. I've purchased 4 of these so far. One for myself and 3 others as gifts because I was so impressed! They take a bit of learning, but there's so much info out there that pretty much anyone can be successful with them. Bought one for my 20 something, bachelor son and he loves it!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is an amazing pressure cooker and we could not be happier!  We tried the recipe for the refried beans first and they were the best ever.  We did experiment making them without soaking but rather followed the recipe for un soaked beans which means you cook them first, empty the pot and then cook them according to the recipe.  The next time we tried it soaking the beans the night before and quite frankly I liked them better using the non soaking method.  Meanwhile we have tried many different things in this cooker and they all have been excellent.  Easy to use I highly recommend this cooker. The amazing thing about pressure cooking is that even though cooking temperatures are higher the greatly reduced cooking times result in less nutrient loss and more healthy food, at a greatly reduced energy consumption."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love the instapot and i am not a cook.  I have used it to make perfect poached eggs, some great lava cake and egg bites.  There are many recipes on the internet but you have to experiment as each pot seems to be impacted by altitude (pressure cooking) and model.  I found times to vary widely when using glass cups versus silicon cups.  I like the fact that this model auto seals.  This model is NOT wifi compatible, but it has not been a problem."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I am shocked that I am actually using it and enjoying it!  I was skeptical, but makes the best tender stews and meats and veggies in a short amount of time.  And the timing chart that comes with it helps tremendously!  Pay attention to that when you are just trying things without a recipe.  Haven't tried making yogurt or anything like that yet.  Only set back is that I find it keeps the smell of what you cook in it for a while even after washing (we washed by hand).  Overall good purchase!"
2.0 out of 5 stars,"You can only fry small portions at a time, the pot divider that is suppose to help you cook 2 different things at a time is useless because it doesn't stay up in the pot! If you want to air fry, my suggestion is buy an air fryer not the air fryer cover for the instant pot. Instant pot your pot steamer plate is useless."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm not a cook, but even I can make a perfect meal.  Follow the directions at first, then mark in a pad or book the changes you need for that meal.  The book covers 80% of the meals you will cook, the rest is the difference in the number of ingredients, the size of the ingredient, and YOUR personal taste.  Always keep notes... If you have a camera handy, video it and keep it in a folder for future use.  Be sure to order an extra sealing ring when buying this... no you won't need it right away, but with continued use, it will gradually deteriorate from the constant steam heat.  On youtube are lots and lots of videos covering the IP DUO60 and how to start up, use it for different meals, and general cooking ideas.  It's a win-win situation.  No need for lots of pans, it browns (saute), steam, etc.  7 in 1 and many more.  It's as foolproof as an item can get. When they make the 10 quart DUO I won't hesitate to buy that one also.  PS... only 1 hitch...Add enough liquid or it won't seal.  2 cups recommended."
3.0 out of 5 stars,"First of all,  I'm short, counters are high.  If you're like me you need to purchase a cart to set it on so it's easier to see in.The next problem is the weight. It's much heavier than the smaller one I originally purchased.That said,  It's a great product!!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"IN TERMS OF COOKING FOOD, THIS ITEM IS SEVER QUANTUM LEVELS ABOVE ALL OTHER COOKERS, ESPECIALLY IF YOU PURSUE WHOLE FOOD  PLANT BASED CONSUMPTION.  DO NOT KNOW HOW OR WHY, BUT THIS ITEM GREATLY ENHANCES ALL PLANT'S TASTE, WHICH IS GREAT ENCOURAGING CHILDREN'S PLANT CONSUMPTION.  MAKE SURE TO PURCHASE ALSO A METAL STEAM BASKET FIT YOUR INSTANT POT (AMAZON HAS BOTH)"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Why did it ever take me so long to buy one of these.  I had a pressure cooker I gave away..to cumbersome for a single person.  This is awesome, fast and easy to use.  In one week since I received it,  I've made yogurt, soup, chinese ribs, pot roast and now I'm going to try Orange Chicken recipe.  It takes such a short time and easy to saute and pressure cook all in one pot...Easy and Fast!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Others have written detailed reviews, so I won't do another one. My only comments is to say, having been using stove-top pressure cooker for a long time, I really didn't know how different it would be cooking with an electric. This thing is way easier to use than I imagined. Saves tons of time - just set and go. My only caution is, beware, this thing is super-efficient, particularly when using the ""non-vented option"" so watch the cooking time, it might not take as long to cook as you might think. It shredded 4 fresh organic turkey legs in 30 minutes of high pressure cooking...next time I would try half the time and see what happens. Another observation is, since there's almost zero water loss when using the ""non-vented"" cooking option, use very little liquid/water when cooking vegetables or any raw food. It conserves the liquid already in whatever it is you are cooking. I was really surprised to find out, it does indeed cook silently. 5 stars definitely!"
4.0 out of 5 stars,I have only used it once so that's why it's only 4 stars but it worked great and my meal turned out awesome. You definitely need to read up on the features and how to use it before you cook. It's way more complex than a crock pot but it saved me an hour cooking time which as a first time mom to a 7 week old I don't have a lot of time. I can't wait to cook rice and other things in it. The fact it can do so many things is awesome! Just do not buy this if you are afraid of pressure cookers. But this one seems to be way safer than any other one I have ever used.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Like everyone else--LOVE IT!  Wow--my stew tastes better. Split Pea soup in 40 minutes (that includes warm up and slow steam release time), chicken dishes in 30 minutes or less; the list goes on. Really brings out the flavor. Tons of recipes online.  I bought the glass top and steamer accessories. At first I was intimidated with pressure cooking, but the Instant pot is so easy to use. Really, just press a few buttons. Easy to clean too.  As a single person, it's hard to cook great hot meals for myself. I get lazy and want something fast.  With this product I can cook great meals in a short amount of time, and have plenty of leftovers (sometimes too many leftovers).  Definitely worthwhile. I was fortunate to buy the Instant Pot on cyber-Monday (which lasted a week!) so I got a great deal (69.99!!!). Highly recommended. If you're concerned about price, look for it on sale. Really, the cost of Instant Pot is already saving me money since I don't stop at the grocery store for hot food every day after work. It's also great fun looking up recipes online, and there are a ton of recipes online! Have fun with this product."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I use the instant pot everyday that I cook to make stock from bones, soup, curry, stews, roasts, rice, Vegetables (including mashed potatoes), cheesecake, cake. I have also used it to sterilize lids, bottles, etc. Clean up is easy. I highly recommend an extra insert with an accompanying glass or silicon lid (storing overnight) and to be able to make more than one item. I.e. dessert as well as main meal.Clean up is a breeze."
5.0 out of 5 stars,This thing will make your cooking easier than smashing your thumb with a hammer. Far less painful too. Seriously though it’s great I suggest you get it cool some pinto beans and fish with some veggies. You will love it. Only down side is it’s not very specific on water to beans or any recipes where you are making more than beans.What I’ve been doing is beans 6 - 8 cups water frozen veggies like broccoli and stuff chicken breast or fish fillet and pressure on high go 50 then let steam out check and throw in rice another ten or so.THE ONLY PROBLEM! Is when you go to depressurize. Sometimes water builds and it sprays condensed water everywhere. I just use a bowl over outlet when I let steam out.Be nice if they had a piece that domed over the steam release valve that drains into the runoff catch.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"What's not to love? The Instant Pot is the new IT appliance. I received one as a gift and have given two as gifts as well as bought one to use during a charity fundraiser raffle. I've cooked in mine often. The time savings is often in the fact that you can set it and forget it. There are nights I don't use it after work because a pot roast is still about 90 minutes start-to-finish, but the quality is excellent. I often cook something after work to use for dinner later in the week, but a quick soup is completely doable after work - I used leftover meat, a bag of frozen soup vegetables, broth and some seasonings and dinner is ready in a flash."
5.0 out of 5 stars,OK I love this lid wasn't sure if it would work with my Farberware 6qt 7in 1 model WM-CS6004W but it did all I needed to do was buy a stainless steel pot to replace my coated pot it came with which you can order right off Amazon. I made frozen Tatar tots and they were better then fast food ones. Going to try dehydrating apples next. Please not that my Farberware pot is a older model and does not have any Bluetooth technology. Also by using it with a none instant pot brand it will void its warranty.
5.0 out of 5 stars,The Instant Pot is a life changer. I know many people claim its a glorified slow cooker but it simply is not. It lets you simply cut some veggies up and throw them in with some meat and walk away. Come back an hour or two later and you have a delicious meal that your whole family will love! The meat is always so amazingly tender with their meat stew. So tender that you don't really have to chew because the force of your tongue pressing against the food makes it fall apart in your mouth. Older people in my family including my grand parents enjoy eating the stew I make because they mostly have dentures and such. They don't like chewing much these days and it makes it much easier for them to enjoy something they want.
5.0 out of 5 stars,Unbelievable pressure cooker for the price! The 6qt one is perfect for meal prepping or cooking for multiple people. The list of recipes goes on and the ease of use is as easy as tossing something in the microwave. Couldn't be happier with this purchase.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I put off buying an instant pot for years because I had a slow Conner and never used it. I've had the instant pot about a month and have used it once or twice a week to cook yummy nutritious meals when I was short and time when normally, we would've eaten more expensive, less nutritious convenience foods. I love it and even my husband finds it easy and convenient enough that he's cooking in it as well. Also, clean up is super easy and there are no toxic surfaces. We are vegetarian and eat a lot of beans and this has been a game changer as far as time, money, and the amount at trash we produce. I bought during a cyber sale, but it's worth the full price!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,I have to admit I was nervous about using an Instant pot. I had never used a pressure cooker in my life prior to buying this. It has turned out to be very very fun to learn new recipes and surprise my family with great meals. You really don’t need to buy a special cookbook as there are plenty of recipes on the Internet that you can get for free.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Well built and sturdy. So far happy with the purchase. As a South Indian we cook rice almost every day and grabbed this one during Thanks giving sale. I was little skeptical despite good reviews. This one cooks rice really well, the consistency of the rice is really good after cooking. We noticed that if we leave the rice for 10-15 min after cooking the excess moisture at the bottom will be absorbed into the rice and you will get a nice non sticky consistency.Pros:Extremely fast especially cooking rice in 12-15 min (My previous Aroma cooker which still works well takes 40 min).Well built and easy to clean as the vessel is dish washer safe.Cons:There should be a mechanism to alert the user if the cooker is in vent mode when we are cooking. We tend to forget to turn the black knob to seal mode when cooking.Making Yoghurt is not as easy as I imagined. Too many modes and options to play with. But I did not buy this for making yoghurt so I am not terribly upset."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This thing is awesome.  I make soups, pot roast, sauce and so much more in my Instant Pot, and everything comes out awesome. I used a traditional pressure cooker, prior to this, as well as a rice maker, and a crock pot.  This has completely eliminated having to keep so many appliances as it does it all.  I was skeptical at first, but I purchased one for myself over a year ago and love it, so I had to purchase another as a gift.  The added bonus is that you don't have to monitor the pressure like you would with a traditional pressure cooker, the cook times are much faster, and the presets are really accurate."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"The InstantPot is super easy to use. It is multi-purpose cooking and can be used to sear, as a rice cooker, slow cooker or pressure cooker. There are tons of online recipes available. I used this all summer when it was too hot to out the oven on and made lots of different dishes in more than half less time that it would normally take! I highly suggest getting accessories for your InstantPot."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"We use this a lot! Goulash, chicken breasts, chili, delicious pork chops! It's very versatile and we look forward to trying other recipes. It's not as fast as you'd think--some dishes take longer than they would cooked in the traditional manner--but taste better when cooked in the Instant Pot. The goulash, for example, just tastes better in the Instant Pot. But, if you need speed, the chicken breasts go from frozen to cooked in less than six minutes! You do need to thoroughly read the instructions and be careful, just as you should with any appliance. I'd recommend this product!"
4.0 out of 5 stars,"I continue to be amazed at how quickly I can cook items. I'm still getting used to the speed of this thing and I sometimes tend to overcook some things and they become a bit on the mushy side. I've also realized that some items come out better than others in this pressure cooker. I tried some butterfly pork chops. While they were cooked, the end result left a bit to be desired. Other meats such as wings, ribs, and rib tips are almost a no brainer. 15 minutes or less and they're ready. A quick pop into the oven on broil with a coating of your favorite sauce and your ready to eat the most tender ribs or wings you've had.I have had a problem with it shutting off from an overheat warning when doing anything with sauce that contains tomato. So I have to add lots of water for it to continue through it's cycle.I'll continue to check out recipes for pressure cookers and see what works for my family and what doesn't."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"After a few months, my instant pot started to leak steam from the vent at high pressure. The pot still worked great at low pressure, but I wasn't happy with the steam loss at high pressure. The company worked with me and determined that the steam sensor might have been letting the internal pressure get higher than usual, thereby releasing steam to prevent a safety problem. (The weight in the vent will never allow the pressure difference to get large enough for a safety problem to occur. The weak point is the vent and it will lift if the pressure goes higher than intended.) The safety features on this multi-cooker are very well designed and the customer service is fantastic. I have a new cooker (works perfectly), and I am sending back the first one. I am at high altitude, so the addition of pressure allows me to cook things that just haven't worked very well without this cooker. I will be getting the 6 Q for Christmas this year. I note that it adjusts the programs for altitude. I've gotten rid of my slow cookers and my egg cooker. Corned beef used to take all day and is done and tender pretty quickly now. Rice on the stove takes about 45 minutes, but is done perfectly in half the time with this pot. Being able to saute ingredients prior to cooking at high pressure (stews, risotto) is a great option. I'll be keeping one on my counter at all times. I've never bothered to write a review before, but I am just that pleased with this item and the company in general."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is the most versatile kitchen appliance I've ever used. It's also very easy to use. If you want to know how to use it, there are guides/cookbooks online. A simple guide is included, but some of the instructions might be a bit vague. Just looks up some YouTube videos or online cookbooks. My wife has successfully cooked some AMAZING salsa chicken very quickly. She was putting the chicken into the pot as I was leaving for the grocery store just down the street. I bought 1 item, and zipped back home, and the chicken was ALREADY DONE!!! WHAT?! I was only gone for about 10 minutes! We are now working on adapting our favorite recipes for this amazing invention. Many of our favorites take 1-8 hours to make, and they are being shortened to 10-60 minutes. Just wow."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This handy lid for your trusty InstaPot adds a whole range of air-fry functionality without taking up valuable real estate on your countertop. I donated my single-function air fryer to charity once I got this unit. A helpful reminder, you MUST use the inner stainless steel or other inner pot that came with our InstaPot, otherwise the switches that let the unit know it is sitting on the InstaPot correctly won’t trigger without it."
1.0 out of 5 stars,Rice was mushy and took longer than on stovetop and roast in pressure cooker mode was dry and tough. Didn’t save any time and food quality was much less. One of worst purchases I have made for it’s cost.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"If it's just yourself and perhaps your significant other using this machine, I think it's the perfect size. It magically cooks everything to perfection, sautés quickly and easily, cleans up in a flash, takes up very little counter space, doesn't heat up the kitchen, makes no noise and no smell (other than when it vents steam). The simplicity of use encourages me to try new recipes -- which are seemingly all over the internet -- and I would even give one of these as a gift. Great product."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love this one for making rice or pasta, smaller meals, steaming veggies, making boiled eggs, or baking potatoes. It is big enough to create meat for 2, but any more people-- I'd get the 6 quart. It's not really big enough to make one pot casseroles though. I tend to use this one for making a side dish and using the bigger pot for making the meat."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I really like my Instagram pot. It lives up to most of the hype. It is not practical for everything and when people say that something takes 3 minutes they neglect so say that it takes 10 minutes to come to pressure and 20 or more for the pressure to release so 3 minute steel cut oats is really 33. But the fact that you don't have to touch it is awesome. And making beans, chili, and hummus. Are simple and fast. I have never been able to make brown rice that wasn't gummy. The Insta pot made it perfectly. I have also made black rice and quinoa in it both have come out flawlessly. I would strongly suggest getting a cook book or finding some recipes online as well as reading the directions thoroughly. I had a mishap the first time I used it. I did not have the release valve in the proper position so I sprayed my entire counter top with the sticky oat liquid. Definitely user error that could have been avoided by reading the directions.Overall I would highly recommend it."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love everything about this IP except for 2 things. First the cord is so short it can barely be plugged in and clear my cabinets. Instead of it being a safety feature, in my kitchen it is a safety hazard. I see ruined cabinet finishes in my future and having to turn it slightly sideways adds a burn risk. Secondly, the 2nd thing I cooked in it is still the smell that I get when I open it. The silicone seal holds odors like you wouldn't believe. Need to buy some spares. (Vinegar soak did not help) I am still experimenting but I really like it so far."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"I love the small size of the mini pot that works like the larger Duo 6 qt. The only thing I don't like is when I remove the lid the entire inner pot comes out. I spashed hot liquid on my arm because the inner pot lifted up with the lid about 4 inches, then fell back down. My 6 qt Duo and Lux 8 qt have never done that so I was not prepared for that to happen. So, I will be contacting the company."
5.0 out of 5 stars,I have my instant pot since 2016 and recently bought the air fryer lid. I am in ♡ with it. I tried to add photos but it did not work.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"One of the top 4 selling items (solo cups no. 1 for reference) at Walmart.  We love this.  The 3 qt size is plenty big for 2 people.  Rehydrates beans, brown rice etc, in no time.  Same with frozen meats.  Amazing to have an electric press cooker that's so easy to use and clean.  The only thing I'd like to see is a cover for the pan, so you could toss it in the fridge. I think they sell those aftermarket thought.  We use a plate that fits on top, so no biggie."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love this product!! You can get a crockpot type meal in less than an hour as opposed to waiting 5 or more hours for it. We buy in bulk and freeze all our meat. I often forget to take the items out the night before to let it defrost overnight. Now I can take the items out in the morning, let it defrost and still have dinner on the table for 6 pm! I recommend doing the ""test run"" to get familiar with the controls and how to close the pot properly. The first day I got it I did the test run and soon after made chicken soup using only one large boneless skinless chicken breast. My husband even commented on how much more flavor there was to this soup than when I cook it all day in the crock pot. The next night I made a boneless pork shoulder roast with sauerkraut/potatoes. Cook the meat first for 30 minutes, quick release, then put in sauerkraut/potatoes and reseal for another 10 minutes cook time on high. Worked beautifully!! I let it rest the next night and for Saturday night I made a venison barley soup. I didn't sauté anything first though (just like when I do a crockpot meal). I put in all the ingredients, set for soup, adjusted time to 40 minutes and it was amazing!!I work at home on the computer but with overtime I don't have much time to spend cooking and minding the stove. I love to use crockpots but this is a crockpot on steroids! Love it! I recommend it for every busy family!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is one of the best things I've bought.  It is so convenient and versatile!  Everything from dinner to desert.  Hard boiled eggs to yogurt!  I have so much fun with this, and it's great for super fast meals!  Make up your meals ahead of time, put them in a bag in your freezer, if you need a quick meal, pull out the bag, put it in your instant pot and you're a hero!  Great little appliance!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love this pot!!! I use it a few times a week. It is amazing! I will try to update, with photos, and recipes. This was worth every penny!!!Cooking frozen meat, when you are in a hurry,  is great!Want to boil a lot of eggs for a recipe, or Easter? Easy in this pot!!!Tons of potatoes for potato salad? This cooks a lot of them quickly!So much you can do with this! I love it so much!It is easy to use!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I could write a positive review on this for days, but I'll save us all the time. My friend actually recommended this product and I love and use it all of the time! 45 minute oven spaghetti squash cooks in 10 minutes (and with perfect texture). Regular stews and chilis are about an hour from start to finish. I even cooked an entire chicken in a half hour a couple weeks ago! The only caveat is keeping in mind the time it will take for the machine to pressurize (for example, it could take soups up to 45 minutes—the more liquid in the pot, the longer it needs), but once you have that down, you can do anything. Definitely a blessing for busy, working moms like me!I do plan to buy a new o-ring for the lid given the amount of cook time this gets, but that's minor. And Barkeeper's Friend is what I use to keep the pot clean, as traditional soap and water don't necessarily cut through the food that's left behind. Easy to manage, easy to love. The next item on my list is to find a good Pressure Cooker Cookbook to explore all the ways I can use this!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I feel like an infomercial actor ever since I purchased the Instapot because I can't shut up about it. I frickin' love this thing. I cook nearly all of my meals in it and I do so very, very quickly. I do recommend purchasing an Instapot cookbook to go with it, it will really help with learning to utilize it to it's full potential. I cook all of my meals for a week in just a couple of hours. This specific size is perfect for myself and my husband, and leftovers for each of us. We plan our meals and waste a lot less now that we have this."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Absolutely love this thing and I’m feeling much more inspired for dinner ideas. Have made lamb stew, hard boiled eggs, chicken stock, mashed potatoes, pork shoulder, and more so far and it’s all been pretty great.  The recipes that came with weren’t to my taste and seemed a little inconsistent quality wise, but the internet has been super helpful. I followed advice and bought extra rings. One for ‘stinky’ foods and one for everything else, plus a backup. I may go back and buy an extra pot but we’ll see.  I got it on a sale price and I have zero regrets."
4.0 out of 5 stars,I've tried all the features now and they work really well; except the saute feature.  It's fine for sauteing but the browning aspect for meat is not one I'll use again.  My Instapot is only a 6 qt and there's just not enough surface area to make it worth the hassle. I brown any meat in the recipe in a skillet on my stove separately-it's less trouble.
5.0 out of 5 stars,I use my IP at least 2x a week. It cooks so fast and makes the most tender meats. I have a cookbook that also shows IP recipes and it’s absolutely wonderful. I have young children and it helps me get a good meal on the table in less time. I can make sweet potatoes for the entire family in less than 30 minutes or a beef stew in less than an hour. We love to eat the home style cooked meals and this IP makes life so much easier.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"So many people I know had one so I ordered one for myself.  It was the best purchase for the kitchen I've ever made!  I love this pot!  It's so nice to cook things so quick!  Especially late in the day!  It's easy to clean, easy to prepare your meal in,  it's just great!  If you don't have one, GET ONE!  I live alone and I wish I had bought one sooner.  I can only imagine how much it would help with a family!"

  What else is there to say about the Instant Pot that hasn't already been said? It's massively popular and a true culinary phenomenon. I heard about it from a friend who heard about it from a friend, and now several of my friends have bought one on my recommendation. This thing is spreading like the gospel.The Instant Pot is extremely easy to use and extremely safe. While there are a number of preset cooking options and it helps to read the manual, I find that I do most of my pressure cooking in manual mode. It is also very easy to clean.The Instant Pot has changed the way I cook. Recipes that used to take hours are done in a fraction of the time, and most of the cooking time is inactive, simply letting the IP work its magic. There is really no comparison to Crock Pots or other slow cookers—it blows them out of the water. I use it even more than I anticipated, and I can't recommend it highly enough."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"I love my Instant Pot Duo Plus 60. It's an amazing piece of cooking technology. My beef with it is it's learning curve. I'm not the smartest person, however I do have a few college degrees; and I'm definitely not a technophobe. Heck, I enjoy pushing buttons. The only thing is that there are so many choices when cooking and a need to understand basics ""pressure cooking"" facts, that it gets overwhelming. The best piece of advice I could give anyone who invests in this unit is: follow the recipes to a ""T"" and do not take any shortcuts. You cannot outsmart a ""smart cooker""!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"So I’ve had this for a few weeks now and I use it 2-3 times a week. I didn’t want to buy a separate air fryer appliance and I liked the idea that I just needed to buy the lid to turn my 6 quart Instant Pot into an air fryer. I love it! Yes, it is smaller than some air fryers but I just air fry more batches instead. I like that it can also bake, dehydrate, broil, roast, reheat, and air fry."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have had this instant pot for almost a year and I absolutely love it. Before I couldn’t even cook rice but this gadget had made everything so easy. It makes the best chicken breast and mashed potatoes. I have come so far, from eating out everyday of my adult life to cooking 3-4 meals a week. I only wish I would have gotten the 6 qt. I plan on getting it soon and using this one for sides only. This is a must have for any kitchen."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This Product is super fast, easy to clean, practical and I love it. The only down part is that there are some dishes that you cant make here, because its just not for everything. But Most of the basics you can do them super fast and easy, like rice, beans, cook meat, and veggies. We just have to find our way.  like like like"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"UPDATE!  I just discovered that my inner pot WAS NOT INSIDE!!  I so appreciate this safety feature even tho I’ve made the Air Frier Lid into the culprit - IT WAS ME!!  This lid has done a beautiful job of browning a whole chicken  - no need to turn it over.  Fries were a hit!  Baked spuds delicious and faster than oven. Toasted bagels, etc.  I’M SO GLAD THAT I DON’T HAVE TO WAIT FOR A REPLACEMENT. THANK YOU AMAZON!!!!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,As many of us do I made resolutions to cook healthier this year. I knew to do so I needed to cook more. I had no idea how much I was going to enjoy doing so in my Instant Pot. Being able to saute and then slow or pressure cook in the same pot saves so much time and cleaning. The speed that you can cook with the pressure cooker is amazing and the flavors when slow cooking in the same pot you sauteed are much better than a regular crock pot.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love the Instant Pot - I have made hard-boiled eggs several times.  In addition, I made Chicken Lo Mein.  I have also cooked brown rice several times.  When I do those things on my stovetop I have to pay attention to time and the burner level to keep from running out of water (which I have done with rice and eggs!)...with the Instant Pot, all I have to do is set it and forget it!  I am looking forward to trying several more recipes!"
2.0 out of 5 stars,"I love my IP. I have a 6 qt. This one I got to travel, and the minute I took it out of the box it didn't quite work right. I tried new seals, but it never pressurized properly.instant pot did right by me after I documented everything, and have sent me a new one. Which is very unexpected but incredibly appreciated."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Amazing.....simply amazing.  I am an extremely busy business woman and have had little time for the luxury of a home cooked meal until now.  Now with my Instant Pot not only do I get home cooked meals, but much better meals than I have been paying for in the restaurants, and for a fraction of the cost.  Wow it's just great!  I've already saved the cost of the equipment by being able to ""eat in"".The only thing that could be better is if a bigger cook book with more dishes in it were included.  I know you can go on line and buy books on electric pressure cooking but it would be more of incentive for people to buy this item it it had a more substantial cook book either included or for sale as an addition.  It's always better if the cook book is for the specific product being offered.  Little secrets that only the inventing cook knows, and insightful to this particular cook pot with all it's specific buttons and whistles. Think about it, supply a nice large cook book.  If you ever do send me one..!"
4.0 out of 5 stars,"As nearly all things I have ordered through Amazon, the pressure cooker arrived when expected in fine condition. With this purchase I am replacing a much loved Cuisinart electric pressure cooker that is still available, and is $30 less expensive. I chose the InstantPot because the Teflon coating was wearing hard on my 2 year old Cuisinart which is bad (and not because of metal utensils). Also, I'd had to already replace the silicone ring (expected), but most recently the pressure sealing pop-up value has been problematic so the unit never pressurized. I thought about replacing the parts (i.e. the lid) but that was $55 and it seemed better to replace the whole unit at that price. So I will compare (thus far) the Cuisinart to the Instant Pot (IP) and hope it helps others since I couldn't find a similar comparison.Many people note that the instructions for the IP aren't good. They are correct. IP seems to run home to its roots of stove top items and PSI numbers.  Cuisinart never did, so I never learned this ""language."" I used my stove top Fagor only briefly. And for an electric, you don't NEED to know that stuff. You only need to know what the machine's buttons do.  For my first try, I wanted to make just simple white rice. This unit is billed as a ""rice cooker,"" after all. But even the recipe in the booklet enclosed (for basmati rice) doesn't use the ""Rice"" function on the machine. I searched far and wide for what pressing the rice button meant -- how long would it cook? how much rice does the Rice setting function plan for you to be cooking, and how should you adjust timing up or down based on volume? Using Basmati rice and their ratio's of 1:1.5 grain to water, I did a manual high pressure for 8 minutes on 3 cups of rice. It was very, very good, but maybe a minute too long--the top was lovely and loose, but the bottom was clumpy and a bit further done than desirable. Now I am making a stew. Compared to the extremely hot browning function on the Cuisinart, even in a nonstick pot, the saute function in the Instant Pot's stainless pot (a major draw for me) felt a bit anemic.  It browned nicely, but took much more time than a fast browning sear should, and the heat level went from ""on"" to ""hot"" (Hot being the goal) when I added cool things to the pan. (And I was browning 5-6 chunks of stew meat at a time. Not a lot.  For both the rice and now the stew, the ""come to pressure"" time feels longer than the Cuisinart's. Still, I am charmed by the idea of making homemade yogurt, and that was an appeal to me on this unit. The rest I will figure out with time, because I refuse to be bested by a machine's clunky instructions when I believe we can develop a great relationship. I'll update on the Stew function.  I browned the meat, sautéed some aromatics, and dumped in your usual stew vegetables, wine, beef broth and hit the STEW function, which sets at 35 minutes under pressure. I would estimate it took 10-15 minutes for the IP to reach the pressure level to begin the countdown. Again -- no telling how much meat and vegetables their 35 minutes means -- and that's just too bad that Instant Pot isn't responding to make things more clear.  I will say that compared to the Cuisinart, the IP unit spews much less steam, is quieter, sits a bit shorter, has a top that is more intuitive, and the truly lovely design of dual lid holders to catch the lid liquid without having to set a hot, wet lid on the counter when you're dealing with a steaming unit. That is a very, very good thing. Amazon gets a 5 on shipping. Instant Pot has what I believe to be a great unit if I can maximize its functionality, which is not something I want to work terribly hard to accomplish. But I hear some beeping so the Stew has completed and the unit has gone into warming. Here's hoping!Adding on from several days later. The stew was terrific, but a minute or two less on the meat would have been fine. Since then I've made an awesome soup and a lovely lemon/basil skinless, boneless chicken breast I'm sure to make again. I figured out that the sauté function could be elevated and I am content that it is, while not my stovetop, not anemic. I still think the Cuisinart is hotter, but I did love sauteeing the chicken in a bit of olive oil and butter tonight with a perfect outcome.  My decision is to worry less about the function buttons, which I will learn over time, and focus on the basics I know and the recipes I love.If you are thinking about buying an electric pressure cooker, don't waste a second more time in thought. Just GET one. You will love the investment, you will use it, you will make great meals fast, and you will explore cuts of meats and vegetables that you might not otherwise have tried, and love them. These appliances are AWESOME. I had a love affair with my Cuisinart but feel like my second relationship with Instant Pot is already terrific.  I am delighted with the functionality and the more I use it, the more I love it."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"My wife asked me to write this comment. She wants everyone to try this perfect pot. She usually doesn't cook a lot of rice recipe. But this pot changed her. The rice is so soft and tasty, also very convenient to clean. We are not sure what kind of tech they are using, but it's really good."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This has revolutionized the way that I cook!  In one pot, I'm able to saute, steam, pressure cook, slow cook, make perfect rice and yogurt.  The pot is very sturdy and well made.  A few days ago I dropped the lid and nearly had a heart attack, but the lid didnt crack or chip!  The inner pot is solid stainless steal and also very sturdy.  For those who wonder about food sticking since it's not teflon coated....I've had nothing stick to the bottom while doing any cooking feature. So far, everything I've made has been absolutely perfect.  There are oodles of youtube videos to help you understand how to use the pot perfectly, not to mention all the on-line recipes to try.  There is also a Face Book group you can join to share recipes and ideas and they'll even help you when you're having trouble.  I am extremely satisfied with this purchase and am even trying to get some of my friends to purchase one too.  I'm also seriously considering a second pot!!  I'm used to using a 7qt crock pot and an 8 qt pressure cooker, but the 6qt Instant Pot has been the perfect size.  If I could give it more than 5 stars I would!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is the best kitchen appliance I own! I live in a ""tiny house"", so I don't have room for all the individual small appliances. It pressure cooks, slow cooks, steams, makes yogurt, just to name a few functions.With it I make yogurt every week and I pasteurize our goat milk using the ""steam"" feature. As a bonus, the company has a great website where owners of the pot share recipes.  I used the slow cook feature and my Thanksgiving turkey breast was amazingly moist, and I had flavorful drippings to make gravy.It's easy to clean...the stainless steel insert lifts right out. The insert can even be used to refrigerate the food.I would purchase this product"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Best thing to come out of Canada since the snowmobile. Love cooking with this. My family and friends rave about how tasty my food, stews, soups, etc. are. I tell them...yeah, old family recipe passed down for generations...and I sweat for hours over the stove. In reality cooking with an Instant Pot is so much faster and convenient. I have another excellent pressure cooker but it is a manual version. With the Instant Pot you hit the pre-programmed button and leave the kitchen. It's all automated. I also like the ease of cleaning. The interior pot just pops out so you don't have to wrestle with the whole unit when cleaning. Can't recommend this enough. Less power, better tasting food, in less time. What's not to like?"
5.0 out of 5 stars,Had another brand but time to get another pressure pot so got an Instant Pot. It can do so much and with all therecipes and You Tube videos I will be busy trying out everything! I recently tried the cold start yogurt and was amazed by how easy and delicious it was.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love my new Instant Pot.  I received it yesterday and used it yesterday.  I made a chicken pasta dish.  The pasta was cooked without being mushy and the chicken was cooked through while keeping shape and still being moist!!  My only drawback is not about the product itself, but my misunderstanding.  While pressure cooking, yes the the time is decreased significantly, but the amount of time it takes to come to pressure as well as release pressure, ended up being the same amount of time I would have spent making each element individually.  The good thing is that it was all one pot and super easy clean up.  I retract a portion of my statement... I used it again today and my pork tenderloin was done in ten minutes, that’s coming to pressure, cooking, and pressure release.  AMAZING!!!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I wanted a bigger one than my 6quart because I couldn't make enough food in it, but this one I think is a little too big. It takes up so much space and takes longer to build pressure (obviously). Its great quality! Just if you are looking for a bigger than 6quart one, just make sure you know that this one is HUGE. maybe go with the 8 quart. Also, it doesn't have many accessories you can buy for it."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Bought this at the recommendation of our neighbor.  We have found we use this many times a week.  My wife and daughter love steaming fresh collard greens and cabbage in 5 minutes or less, and I particularly like cooking dried beans under pressure in minutes not hours.  We have even started cooking chowders and other dishes we enjoy from our slow cooker under pressure in a small fraction of the time as well.  No more 5 minute quick rice for us, as this thing cooks better textured and tasting dried rice simple enough in minutes. We have not advanced to cooking meats, but have had some great meats and vegetables our neighbor has cooked in his.Wish we had bought one sooner.  We are already using this several times a week and advancing to using it for more and more meals as we discover how easy and quickly it is to use.Edit:After 5 1/2 months we are still finding ourselves using this several times a week.  My wife has been buying 2lb bags of frozen shrimp and we set this thing to steam for 3 minutes and it comes out perfect.  Chili is done in 30 minutes.  Still cooking a lot of beans. Our favorite chowder with dried blackeyed peas, celery, onions, peppers, sausage and broth we can fully prepare in under and hour.  Cooking a whole chicken to use for chicken noodle soup or with dumplings is done in record times also.  The prep time is the same for everything, but it saves a ton of time cooking.Only a few times have I seen the slow cooker out and we used to use it at least once a week.  When I see the slow cooker out now know my wife is cooking pot roast.  She still hasn't tried cooking her roast in the Instant Pot.  Many dishes we enjoy and don't typically fix due to lack of time, we can now prepare any time we want."
4.0 out of 5 stars,This lid works great and cooks the food well but by the time you put the basket in the IP there is very little space to cook. It's just my husband and I but even at that things like chicken tenders or wings have to be done in batches. I will probably eventually upgrade to a larger air fryer.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have a Cooks Essentials pressure cooker but this Instant Pot is absolutely the best.  So many safety features and you can get cookbooks on Amazon just for this unit.  I do recommend getting an Instant Pot cookbook.  Why?  Most pressure cookers cook at 16 psi.  Instant Pot cooks at 12 psi max.  That means that if you use a regular pressure cooker cookbook, you have to increase the times by 15%.  Not a big deal but I want to know when I start what time I need.  If the only thing you made in this product was rice it would be worth the price.  Perfect rice all the time.  One of the cookbooks told me how to do it.  Also, you need to know when to quick release or natural release.  I saute in this unit, I steam, I use it to make corn on the cob, soups, stews, pastas, ribs, roasts, chicken....everything.  A very good product, especially for the non-cook.  I am a non-cook and now my family gets some tasty dishes.  Oh, mash potatoes in a snap."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"While I love this as a pressure cooker (perfect size for 2) it is becoming a little temperamental to seal. The float and release valves need to be jiggled sometimes to fully seal. I’ve never had food overfill and contaminate those valves. I’ve not used this as a slow cooker because I can’t find a glass lid to fit this size ( not sold). I also can’t find official OEM silicon replacement seals. I wish instant pot would sell those for this size.  With all those warnings, I completely love the pressure cooking function. Deducted a star for this and lack of aftermarket accessories. Feels safe and once you’ve checked to be sure the cooker is sealed under pressure, you can walk away - which is great. When done automatically converts to warming setting. Very nice."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought this pressure cooker, due to the price on black friday, and mainly for cooking wild game that can be very tough to tender up.  I used the cooker this evening and was very impressed with my first time experience.  I thawed out and pressure cooked a venison neck roast (bone in) in exactly 77 minutes and the meat was falling off the bone.  It normally took me 3-4 hours of cooking by conventional pot on stove method to get this result.I added potatoes, cabbage and carrots which took 20 minutes, but next time I will try 15 minutes as they were a little mushy, but still intact.  The taste of the roast and vegetables was very good and much better than the old method.I'm sure I can beat the time above by using the high pressure instead of normal pressure I used this time.  Not bad though for the first time!Now looking forward to pressure cooking some tough old squirrels, bet it won't take nearly as long as before."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought this from Amazon Warehouse. The description said that the packaging was damaged, which was OK. However, the pot itself was dented, and I was not sure about that. But I tested it out and it works fine. And it's one of those rare gizmos that lives up to its hype. It's easy to use and there are a bazillion recipes out there.However, I would recommend buying an Instant Pot cookbook right away. The booklet that comes with the pot is pretty useless."
5.0 out of 5 stars,This thing is awesome.  I should of gotten a bigger one!  Next time i will.  I even got my boyfriend to start using it (although he only makes rice in it) it was still a success.  You can do so many versatile things with this and the recipes are endless!!
5.0 out of 5 stars,"As long as you pay attention to the directions and/or know how to use a pressure cooker you will not have issues with this item. My husband loves it and has always used a conventional pressure cooker so this took some getting used to but once he started experimenting with it he absolutely loves all the things it can do, including boiling eggs much easier than we normally do (which we do every week so a HUGE plus for us). He has made roast, shredded chicken, mashed potatoes and more with no issues - just pay attention to how the pressure should be released and you'll be good!"
2.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought this cooker specifically for cooking artichokes. It under cooked them and the time left to cook kept changing, so I couldn't figure our if they were done.  I tried the pot for rice and it was just as confusing. So I gave this pot to a friend who was willing to try it. She had the same issues but fussed around with it trying to guess the cooking time. Save your money. I have a slow-cooker and a pressure cooker that both work better. An all in one cooker would have been nice but this one isn't it!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I was reluctant to jump on the “instant pot” train because I wasn’t sure how much I would actually use it & didn’t need another “kitchen gadget” taking up space. After some research & talking to friends who had one I decided to go for it and I’m very glad I did. I use this pot at least 3 times a week but usually more. This thing is so versatile! If I forget to defrost something for dinner, doesn’t matter. I can still cook it in this pot and it comes out great! I can’t say enough about how many tasty recipes are out there for this pot. I love it because it makes my life easier and clean up is a breeze."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I do not know how to cook at all.  I have made pot roasts, rice, frozen chicken, thawed chicken, French onion soup, so much more.  It was delicious and no one got sick.  😂 So easy to use.  I love mine.  Even my husband has used it."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"The only negative I have is the amount of time it takes to get up to temperature.  Advertising 40 minutes to cook dry beans, for example, only to find it takes 30 minutes to get to temperature and another 10+ minutes to realistically cool off enough to open the lid when done, is a long time you may not have planned for.But this cooker is well built, with a nice thick gasket ring that prevents leaks, lots of buttons, and the all important manual button.  Easy to clean, too, and stainless steel instead of aluminum or nonstick put is nice.  Be sure you clean the interior vent on the lid or it will gunk up.  The piece pops off. For <$100, great buy.  But don't overpay."
1.0 out of 5 stars,"i threw mines away. it was too complicated to understand.. i tried to just make rice and it kept saying 7 minutes but when you adjust the time, it goes by 10s... yes, like 10 minutes, 20 minutes, 30 minutes.. it's probably a preference thing, read the instructions and i couldn't find it..after an hour messing around with it i just threw it away. nothing should be this complicated when you're making rice."
5.0 out of 5 stars,Thanks to a Facebook group for AIP followers I bought the pot for past Black Friday when someone posted it was 50% off on Amazon. Great deal and the pot has been so useful for cooking vegetables in about 6 minutes. Everything takes a lot less amount of time to cook and since you need to use a very small amount of liquid to cook veggies you don't waste nutrients.  Still need to try it to cook meats but I recommend it greatly!
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I thought I would like the slow cooker option but have so far only used as a pressure cooker. Anything that can take fully frozen chicken, lemon, water and the herb of my choice and spit out an edible meal in less than 30 min is a keeper.  Also have enjoyed taking a huge hunk of pork (7/8 lb) and producing pulled pork in 2 h.... enough to freeze and keep several servings. It is easy to clean. No complaints so far."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Did it meet my expectations? YES!!! OMG I love this little machine. It's simple, fool proof, efficient, easy to clean, easy to understand the directions, there are untold numbers of recipes just waiting to be tried and it makes my rice Hunan restaurant perfect! I'm on a calorie deficit diet for the next few months in an effort to save my knee (weight gain has exacerbated an existing issue,) and being able to prepare my meals on the counter using a single pot has made what could be a monotonously long experience into a fast and painless one. Having the ability to cook small amounts and quickly makes it a pleasure!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,My mom fell in love with this pot after using it for the first time in a friend's house and we decided to get it for my new apartment. This is the perfect size for two people. It does everything. Probably particularly great for Asian cuisine.
5.0 out of 5 stars,Instant Pot duo 6quart arrived in excellant new condition. Came with what was advertised Instant pot recipe book was full of good ideas and hints. User manual was very useful better manual than usual answered all my questions. Never used a pressure cooker before. So I dived right in and made a pot roast. wow how much fun this is perfect roast and vegies. So far all is great. Will update after I have used it longer. Give it a try .
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is a great cooker. Very versatile. Have made several things in it but my specialty has become NY cheesecake. I would buy this again.EDIT: Since purchasing this one I have purchased 2 more. The instapot is one of the best kitchen appliances I have used. The 2 that I have given for gifts are used more than we use ours. The chili Colorado out of the recipe book is overt the top. Shredded it, put it in a tortilla, cheese and enchilada sauce over the top and a quick bake in the oven. Made anasazi beans. Excellent.Easy to clean. Easy to cook just about anything with it. I would highly recommend the company and the instapot. Makes life a bit easier and we are all looking for that. Buy one. You will not regret it."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Where have you been all my life. This pot cooks my stew in a fraction of the time.  I cooked pot roast, potatoes and carrots in 40 minutes.  If you are looking for good meals and are a busy working adult with kiddos to feed, buy this.  I am skeptical about new products and am a traditional stove cooker but this is definitely a game changer. I love this pot, soups to roast to sautéed onions, I have used this for it all.  Love that you can use it as a regular pot and purchase a lid.  Plan on using this for travel and camping.  Easy to use, programmable and easy clean up."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love this so far, but there are a couple of things to be warned about.  I suggest right away you buy extra seals.  The seal picks up the smells of food and you may want, as some of the extra seal packages suggest, to have one for sweet food, one for spicy, and one for general.  I finally got rid of most of the smell by soaking in vinegar, then washing in dishwasher, then putting outside to air out.  This is my one complaint.  The only other issue is the manual is not really clear on some things.  You will find your best help online."
1.0 out of 5 stars,"We brought the Instant Pot and initially we were really pleased with it.  Cooking things such as Brown Rice, Beans etc becomes an easy automatic task and they come out perfect.However, the Instant Pot stopped working after 1 month.  We used it probably 10 times during this period.  A quick look through the internet showed lots of people with the same problem which was basically that the display says ON but there is no pressure building up.  We tried all the things recommended nothing worked.We reached out to Instant Pot three times via their support page and not once have they had the courtesy to write back to us.  We have seen from other reviews/forums that they basically fob people off and try to tire you out with long emails asking you to do things in the hope you will go away instead of allowing you to return the item.Potentially a good product if the pot worked for more than a month for which it wont from the reviews.  The support is non existent and we're now left with an oversized paper weight and the need to do a charge back on our credit card.  Very disappointing."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Bought in Nov of 2017 - almost 3 full years of use now. I use it for whole small chickens, portioned turkey, tough cuts of beef, and bone broth from leftovers. Makes amazing bbq ribs. Incredible pork shoulder for carnitas and pulled pork. Italian soups, ossobuco, oxtail stew, ratatouille, and I will never make grits any other way - perfect once you figure out your recipe. And anything I was using a crockpot for, I've been using this instead. Easy to keep clean. My mouth has been very happy with this purchase."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Really great if you already have an instant pot. In hindsight, I’d prefer a dedicated air fryer due to the size limitations of the instant pot"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I would have never thought I would buy a pressure cooker.  There are no chefs in our home, and the thought of my grandmother's pressure cooker hissing the whole time bring back annoying memories.  No thanks!  Then it happened... our weather guy at my squadron brings in this pulled pork he put together in about an hour and it was amazing.  A few days later he rolls in with some chicken, potatoes, and carrots he made in 30 minutes.  When I learned he was making meals in an electric pressure cooker I was floored.  We immediately bought one and use the darn thing all the time now.  No annoying hiss, no crazy 50lb pot.  I put in whatever we want to cook, press the button for the item (beef, chicken, rice) and press go.  The rest is all details to me.  It is no fuss, works perfectly every time, and is a cinch to get a great meal in minutes.  It even takes frozen chicken breasts and 14 minutes later, whammo... yummy!  There are a ton of recipes online to check out.  Oh, we made our pulled pork at home and it was delicious!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"So far so great. I had read reviews and was a little worried because a few people got products that didn’t work right, or work for very long before breaking. I was also worried about ease of use. I have had mine only a month but it’s still going strong. I have used it a handful of times and it works like a charm. I have even made bone broth. I am really happy I made this purchase. One thing is that I am very careful when changing from sealing to venting, it can be easy to burn your arm."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This thing is seriously amazing.  As a business owner, this is the only way we get to eat healthy food.  Not kidding.  I used to rely on my crockpot but there were too many times I got so busy that I didn't put frozen chicken or whatever in it in time to eat dinner at a decent hour, so I got this.  Dinner from frozen chicken is ready in 22 minutes.  Can't beat that.Read the directions on this one.  It's important. It's not intuitive.  Not hard, just not intuitive.  Love it and recommend it to everyone."
5.0 out of 5 stars,The size is perfect for me.  I don't get stuck having a ton of leftovers which is ideal.  There are a ton of recipes available online and it's really fun trying new ones out.  My favorite to make so far is lasagna in a springform pan.  Never thought it could be done in the InstaPot but it comes out great!
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have a larger Instant Pot that didn't have the yogurt function.  I bought this one specifically for that and it makes 12-14 4oz servings perfectly.  Great for my husband, step-son, and myself.  I also use this smaller one to cook side veggies and beans."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Pressure cookers make quick work of normally tough cuts of meat that would otherwise take hours in a low and slow oven or simmering on the stove top.  They are superior to slow cookers because the internal temperature in the pressure cooker triggers the Malliard reaction and breaks down collagen into gelatin.  Food cooked in slow cookers tends to come out watery and lack unctuousness, whereas the same ingredients in a pressure cooker have a rich mouth feel and deeper flavor.I've had this particular model for a couple weeks.  I've made enchiladas, split pea soup, a braised beef stroganoff, and beef stock.  Beef stock, in particular would normally take 10+ hours.  The results have been fantastic.  The controls are easy to use and the machine knows not to start the timer until after it achieves the specified pressure.  Food comes out great and it's easy to clean.  I haven't experienced any scorching or burned food on the bottom.The unit's capacity is the biggest drawback - To make a decent amount of beef stock I had to cook it in three batches.  Additionally, I haven't tested the saute function since I have a heavy enameled cast iron dutch oven that I've been using to brown food and bring the contents to boil (eg., for beef stock).  Even a cursory look at the cooking surface area of the cooking chamber lead me to believe you would not be able to brown more than say a pound or so of cubed beef chuck or short ribs simultaneously if you desire a deep golden brown.Having said all that, if you want to pressure cook large volumes of food and don't want to be limited in the searing department, you'd be better served purchasing a stovetop pressure cooker.  Stovetop units come in higher capacities and have heavier and larger cooking surface areas.  The flaws I'm talking about are true of the electric models generally, not the Instapot specifically.  For me, the inconvenience starting on the stovetop and pouring the contents into the Instapot is outweighed by the automation of the electric models.  This is definitely a set it and forget it situation to the extent you can say that about a pressure cooker.  I highly recommend the Instapot."
5.0 out of 5 stars,What a great idea for an attachment for the Instant Pot. I now have a totally different product. I have not used it a lot but I love it so far.
1.0 out of 5 stars,It broke after 2 years.  Junk. I’m going to look at other brands. You were warned. They have the worst customer service and don’t care. Consider something else.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This cooker is so  versatile & cooks in a jiffy!  Get perfect baked potatoes, steamed vegetable, rice, dried beans, soups, stews, taco meat, eggs, oatmeal from steel cut or rolled oats, chili and so much more.  My favorite accessory is the  ""Instant Pot Steamer Basket 6 Quart or 8 Quart + RECIPE EBOOK. Great Pressure Cooker Insert Accessory for Steaming Eggs, Vegetables and Fruits.

4.0 out of 5 stars,"I take a star away because the instructions are useless and only for the 6 or 8 qt Instant Pot (seriously... the instructions and buttons are different for this 3 qt pressure cooker, so why not provide an instruction booklet for the actual device one bought?  I had to get better instructions online from other people's blogs).  It's a nice pressure cooker.  Small interior pot (3 quart) but since it's a pressure cooked, the overall device is still quite large and space consuming. But it works well."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This lil contraption is a life changer!  We don't even bother putting it away because we use it almost daily and it takes little counter space.  We've donated our extra rice cooker & vegetable steamer to Goodwill - and are probably about to say bye bye to the crockpot too!  I've not used it since the Instant Pot came into our lives.The instructions that come with the IP are fair, but the online FB community is fantastic!  I've learned more about how to work this machine and good links to foodie blogs and making alterations to recipes from the community than from instruction manual.  As I've learned from the FB community, once you become confident in use of the IP, the desire to get a second pot becomes overwhelming.I've made the mistake of starting an IP meal and my rice cooker at the same time.  The IP is long complete with dinner -- and I'm twiddling my thumbs waiting for the rice cooker to finish.  Guess you could say the IP has made me both more time savvy and impatient."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Luv my new pot!  Watched and waited patiently for it to go on sale.  Was beginning to think I’d have to wait til Black Friday, but was thrilled to see it go on sale for Labor Day.  Got it at an amazing price!  I already own the 6qt. Duo and had been drooling over the 8qt. for quite some time.  It’s a bit taller and wider than the 6qt. version, but will work perfect for larger roasts and full pots of soup or chili, with plenty left over to save or freeze.  Thanks Amazon!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"After deciding to start a ketogenic diet, many sources online pointed to the Instant Pot as a must-have item. I looked at a few of the different models, and decided on the Instant Pot DUO Plus 60 because of its extra features over less-expensive models, and the fact that I found a great deal on an open-box item through Amazon Warehouse Deals. (One quick note on Warehouse Deals: I bought this item as ""Like New"" for about $50 less than new, and you could have fooled me. Fantastic deal!)Setup was easy, and the box includes a hefty recipe guide to get you started with your new appliance. First thing we made was white rice for the kids, which was a little stiff for my liking. Maybe a tweak in timing could fix this, but we have yet to explore that. Everything else we've made has hit the ball out of the park! I made some bone broth the second day, and was amazed by the results. Also cooked up some barbacoa and pulled pork, both of which were delicious and made meals for days. Another go-to for us is hard-boiled eggs, which is so easy and fool-proof that they have become a regular snack around our house.This thing also cleans extremely easily. My only main gripe with the Instant Pot is that the seal under the lid will hold onto odors from some of your cooking (looking at you, bone broth!). It is certainly not a deal breaker, but its definitely clear why they sell replacement seals. Might not be a bad idea to pick up a few and switch them out for certain recipes.Overall, I love this thing, and have been recommending it to family and friends. I'm almost certain you'll be happy with it too!"

I have used several one pot cooking recipes from the Internet and it comes out great. Does take a bit of getting used to and having a relative or neighbor with one would have smoothed some of the transition fron stove top cooking.  What I love is the idea of loading the pot, push a button and walk away - set it and forget it."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"If only I had a bigger one! I was NOT a slow cooker person as I stored mine for 6 years and used exactly 3 times. Instant pot is a mama/busy person’s bestie!!! I now make so many more dishes and soups! So quick! My only qualms are that I would have ordered a bigger one as I like to add lots of stuff and learned the max line the hard way... and that the seals tend to smell like the last meal. Other than that, the functions I’ve used are great and it doesn’t explode!!!...unless you do a quick release past the max line... yeah, my bad. I love my instant pot! I get it now!!!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I got the eye roll and sigh ""what useless appliance did you buy now?""  ""Don't we already have two of these?"" when it was delivered.  Now he's using it on his own.  It's so easy!  It actually does what it says it does!  So glad I chose the 8-quart.  Love that it's stainless steel interior - no deadly Teflon.  Cleans up as good as new.  I ordered extra seals after reading reviews here.  The silicone seal does retain a bit of the smell of your dish.  I tried Dawn, vinegar, and baking soda.  Extra seals were cheap and now I'm prepared.  This is the third electric pressure cooker we've tried.  The other two are gone now."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"Like this smaller pot in the RV. Hate the controls. Still trying to find manual mode, since it's not a hard key on the panel. I seriously like my big instant pot by another maker. But it's too large. So, I have been using the 3 qt in the RV for the month last year, and almost 3 months during a trip away as the shelter in place hit. Still cannot make it function as my big pot with manual choices."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"I've had my Instant Pot for a month or so now. I am happy with the Instant Pot's performance on the tasks I have used it for thus far. For example, I have used it once per week to make yogurt, and it does a great job. The first batch required a little more hands on time, as I figured out the process. But subsequent batches have required very little effort. I recommend draining the whey off of the yogurt if you like it thick, but either way, it is nice to be able to control the sweetener and flavoring of the yogurt, which always tastes very fresh. In addition, I have used the Instant Pot several times to make hard boiled eggs. They come out perfect after 5 minutes of low pressure, and are extraordinarily easy to peel. I have used the Instant Pot to steam veggies twice, and to make beef stroganoff once. Those came out okay, but I think will improve if I make adjustments to the cooking time and / or recipe itself. All in all, I am glad I have an Instant Pot. But I am giving it 4 rather than 5 stars because I think it has some limitations - I don't think chicken would cook very well, texture-wise, in the Instant Pot. Although it advertises a quick cook time, usually the cook time does not account for the time for the pot to come up to pressure, so it takes longer to cook some things than you might think, to the point that you have to think about whether it's just more efficient to use the stovetop or oven. And, given the size and shape of the Instant Pot, making many things (e.g., ribs, certain individual desserts, pork shoulder, etc.) requires either odd cutting of hunks of meat or odd stacking techniques. For that reason, I wish someone would come up with a multi-function electric pressure cooker that has shorter and wider design."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"It took a little effort to learn how to use this appliance, but once I got the hang of it, I fell in love with it!  I have made steel cut oats in 4 minutes, rice in 6 minutes, a baked potato in 12 minutes, made my own pumpkin puree in 13 minutes, and then there are all the delicious soups, stews, and even cheesecakes that can be made in this little gem of a time saver!  I found out about this Instant Pot from a friend on Facebook who raved about hers. I just went through breast cancer treatment and also work 2 jobs, so this was a total lifesaver for me, as my time and energy are so limited.  I am so happy to have this.  I highly recommend it.  Oh, and I would highly recommend that you purchase some of the cookbooks specifically for Instant Pot recipes to get you started, or join the Instant Pot Community on Facebook for more tips and recipes and ideas from other users.  Once you get comfortable with using it, you won't be disappointed!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Solid and well built product.  Really like the stainless pot.  Great instructions that are easy to follow.  Additionally the product is well supported by YouTube instruction videos.  First try I made brown rice that was light, fluffy and tender.  Then tried making cowboy beans from dry pinto beans - success there as well.  I read the manual (I know that's a bit strange for a guy to do - my wife has convinced me) and watched a few YouTube video's and found using the Instant Pot Duo Mini is quite easy!  Nice recipe book included."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I absolutely love my instant pot. I was worried when I first got it and after seeing people show pictures of their instant pot fails. But I have yet to have any issue with mine and it cooks perfectly. I use it at least 2-3 times per week and it is so easy to clean. There are so many possibilities with the instant pot. I have had it for 2 months and still have yet to try out all the options and settings. It’s so convenient when I’m running low on time or in a hurry to just throw my meat and potatoes or whatever else I’m making into the pot, turn it on, and in no time I’ve got a hot, fresh, perfectly cooked meal. Such a great appliance to have in this day and age of always having to rush. Can’t say enough good things about it."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I don’t know where to start because this cooker is so great, so I’ll just tell you the end... it’s a life-changer and I cannot get enough of it. You can make anything your heart desires in a fraction of time that it would normally take. Your husband will think you slaved over the stove all day when you really laid on the couch watching trash TV with your dogs. It doesn’t get any better than this."
1.0 out of 5 stars,I ran the test cycle with the 3 cups of water as instructed.  I then went to sauté some meat and the lights on the screen never lit up. I let the insta pot  completely cool down overnight.  I plugged it in and nothing happened.  I am so disappointed.  Reading previous reviews I see this has happened to others as well. Thank goodness I saved all my packing materials. It’s going back.
1.0 out of 5 stars,"I ignored the one-star reviews thinking they were just people who just didn't use the product as intended. I had my first Instant Pot for a year until it just shut off in the middle of cooking a pot of rice. Cable wasn't faulty, outlet wasn't faulty. It never turned on again. I bought another one thinking it was just a freak accident, and this time it didn't even last two months - it just shut off the exact same way when cooking something and would not turn on again.While I'm busy getting hungry again I'll be looking at some other brand of pressure cooker besides Instant Pot."
5.0 out of 5 stars,It's an amazing addition to the Instant Pot. It's so easy to eat healthy now. It does a great job giving vegetables an awesome grilled taste. I add a bit of smoked salt and a light olive oil spray to frozen veggies and 10 minutes later have a super healthy snack.The only thing I don't like about it is cleaning the fryer liner. The metal is stamped on the bottom in a way that traps food and makes it difficult to clean.
4.0 out of 5 stars,Decided on trying out the new Instapot.....Well I think dinner would have been amazing but.... I tried a new thing..... bone brothChicken bone broth.... “smelled like I shoulda listened to my nose”But I was like I got this...added all my usual seasonings....It looks wonderful...Smells amazingBut the taste.....I have never tasted something before that didn’t have a taste but still tastes terrible...1...2....3... chicken bullion later some extra seasoning..... All the things it tasted like1. If a chicken had turned into a zombie and then someone caught it killed it and decided to make soup2. What I thinChicken vomit would taste like3. What I imagine depression and bulimia tastes like4. What I am confident Frank Gallagher from shameless smells like....5. What I imagine  Crow stew would  taste likeWhat it did not taste like....Edible.... shit hurt my stomach...On the bright side it only took me 35 minutes to make what taste like the after wash an Exorcism of a demonic chicken... the meat was extremely tender.... great gift
5.0 out of 5 stars,"These have come down in price since I bought mine, but, at the time, this was a great deal.  I have to say the InstaPot is an amazing addition to my kitchen small appliance collection.  The first time I used it, I was a little confused and nervous about using it properly.  The instructions leave a little to be desired, and you'd hate to have the lid blow off!  There is definitely a learning curve in getting comfortable with using this, but once you are, it's fabulous.  I can take frozen chicken out of the freezer and make a meal in less than 25 minutes!  I would not buy any brand but this original one.  Highly recommend the product."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Why did i wait so long to purchase an IP?  I love it, I use it at least once a day and sometimes multiple times.  Everything comes out so perfect and especially the rice - wow!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"There is not a single thing that I don't like about this pressure cooker. Its the best kitchen appliance ever made.  Safe and ready with every untesill easily found to be used with it and everything is zoo affordable unlike The P.Chef models. I highly recommend this to anyone whether you know how to use it or not.  It is simple and cuts it mess, time and clean up There are recipes on YTube for anything you can possibly imagine. You are losing out if you don't have one on you kitchen,  especially if you have a busy lifestyle and most do."
1.0 out of 5 stars,stopped working after an year.Was good for a year.The unit started  malfunctioning after a year.The pressure cooking option would never turn on.when connected to to AC outlet every once in a while it goes to saute mode automatically.i cannot use it anymore. Also warranty is void after a year.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"If you are on the fence about this thing, just get it. I was on the fence for a while and finally went for it about 3 weeks ago. I've barely used my oven/stove since. This thing was made for working moms. I find that it does help to plan ahead and know what recipe I'm going to be making when I get home, but I can have good healthy dinners on the table for us to eat within 30 minutes of getting home from work. Good bye frozen chicken nuggets and frozen pizzas. We are done with you. (Except for sometimes when chicken nuggets are the only thing my 2 year old will eat, because ya know...2 year olds.)PROs:-Fast-Delicious-Easy to use and follow directions-Inner pot dishwasher safe-Hard boiled eggs peel SO easily-One pro specific to the instant pot brand as opposed to other electric pressure cookers, which I'm sure work just fine, is that this is the pot most people have so they write the recipes for the instant pot which makes them easier to follow and leaves less room for error for those of us who are newbies are pressure cooking-You can saute with this product, which is more conducive to one pot meals, which means less clean upCONs:-I need another inner pot because I'm wanting to use it every day so I'm continually washing it-Some of the cook times are a little deceiving because it does actually take several minutes for the pressure to build"
5.0 out of 5 stars,I use my instant pot all the time. From sauté to complete one dish meal it's really great and has helped me incorporate more bean dishes and veggies into my diet because they cook so quick. Safety features are excellent-never have to worry about it becausevau tomatically goes into warming mode when cooking is done. Comes with a great starter recipe book and there's a huge instant pot following online. I've had it for over a year now and still use it at least once or twice a week. Batch cooking has never been easier. SuggestIon: go ahead and order a second pot liner-makes it easier to cook multiple dishes in succession
1.0 out of 5 stars,"After all the great things I heard about the Air Fryer Lid I was so excited to try it. I am so disappointed. There is definitely a safety issue. After just 2 uses, the non-stick surface started flaking off. I use only a soft towel to clean....definitely no scrubbing at all. Am returning."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I was on the fence about buying an Instant pot, but I am glad I did! I have used it everyday since it arrived. I find it very easy to use and to find recipes my family loves. If you are like me and intend to add food to the slow cooker but forget until there is no longer time, this is what you need! If you are afraid to use a pressure cooker, get this! It does everything! I love it."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought this pressure cooker when it had a 50% off sale during prime day. I have been using since it arrived and I love it. I use it to make Chicken, Burgers, Shredded Pork, Ham, Steaks, and so on. This thing is a lifesaver most of the time. The rubber ring for the unit does have some minor issues when taking it off and on, but it still works great. I am hoping to get a few years of work out of it, so fingers crossed."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I put off buying this thing FOREVER! I had a pressure cooker and a slow cooker, why do i need an Instant Pot? I'll tell you why, because it's soooo much easier and takes up half the space. It does a better job, cleaning is easy, the options are limitless. I bought this on sale over Christmas and have used it multiple times a week since. I've made chicken, quinoa, rice, broth, and cake. Not bad! Bonus is that it doesn't heat up the house when I use it."
3.0 out of 5 stars,"I like a lot of things about this pot, the quick way to cook rice with pressure cooking and the pot is not coated with plastic. However, the silicon ring holds smells so it always smells like old rice or broccoli and there seems to be no way to get the smell out. This is a game changer for me. I don't like it. I'll go back to the cheapie rice cooker i had before."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I LOVE my Instant Pot! This is the 4th one that I have purchased in the last 6 months. Perfect gifts. This one was sent to my daughter for her fund raiser, which was a big hit. Everyone wanted to win it.As for why I love my pot, it is the ease of cooking. Everything comes out perfect and quickly. Even frozen meat can be added; it only takes a couple of extra minutes. Just amazing. I have received multiple compliments on meals done with my Instant Pot and how tender the meat is.Amazing pot. You won't go wrong. Buy now for Christmas gifts before the price and demand goes back up."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is the second Instant Pot I have purchased. I bought it primarily to be able to cook rice and potatoes at the same time as my main dish. Last night I made baked potatoes in it and they were perfect! Loaded 5 medium potatoes into it, after washing and poking them with a knife, and set the pot for 25 minutes. I was nervous opening the pot for fear they wouldn’t be ready when my roast was but they were perfect. Very moist! And the skins were very soft and easy to eat. I’m excited to be able to cook jasmine rice in this small pot while I cook an Asian inspired chicken or beef dish in my larger one."
1.0 out of 5 stars,"I cook a lot, but admittedly am new to pressure cookers, but purchased this for our motorhome thinking this might facilitate easy meal preparation with limited counter space...how disappointed I was to learn that most of the recommended meals can be made much easier on a regular cooktop stove. The instructions are grossly misleading and confusing.  I wish I could return it but apparently my ""free time"" has expired...total waste of money and time trying to figure out...very disappointed."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Good lord why didn't i get two of these ten years ago???  Just made a quick, easy risotto with the kids.  Pancetta, peas, arborio rice... 30 minutes to prep the veggies, dice the pancetta and saute everything up.  The pressure cooker comes up to temp and pressure in 5-10 minutes and it cooks for 6 without sitting and stirring constantly.  The rice came out with a perfect chew and didn't over absorb.  Easy meal.  I've made bbq ribs, I've made chicken, I've made beef short ribs, risotto's and we got this because I'm a single dad that needs to get reasonably priced, healthy meals made quickly that the kids will actually eat.  This is AWESOME.  I had a scare tonight when the unit didn't turn on when plugged in... the cord was loose.  I depend on this sucker to get food on the table after work."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Works well, just like every other electric pressure cooker. Electric pressure cookers have a lower pressure than stove top pressure cookers, so they take about 20% longer but you do not have to keep watching over them to keep constant pressure without over pressurizing. Really, ALL of the electric pressure cookers look almost exactly alike so I suspect they all come from the same factory, the only difference being more or less wiz bang electronic timer functions. This one, though has a stainless insert. All the others have non stick. I do not use non stick. If you do, I don't care. That is fine with me so don't respond about this and tell my why it doesn't matter. If you want a stainless insert, this is the only one I could find. Everything that I have made has turned out well, just as expected, and quite honestly, since you have to put liquid in to use it, even if I used the pot to brown something first, you essentially deglaze the bottom during cooking so I have not had any trouble cleaning the stainless insert."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought this in November 2019 as a quick alternative to a slow-cooker, and it works like a dream. I can use the programmed functions or I can use it as I would a stovetop pressure cooker by just using the ""pressure cook"" program, and setting the timer. I like that once the cooking process finishes, it automatically switches to ""warm."" Super easy use, and can cook frozen meats and veg. The 6 qt size is good for 4-6 servings if it's full."
1.0 out of 5 stars,Writing this review to warn others thag this may not be an original product! It does not deal properly and it overflows making it dangerous! I had the original one I bought from Walmart and it never gave me trouble the four years that I had it. So I am very well acquainted with how to properly use it. This product just doesn’t do what it should be doing!
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I just got this pressure cooker/slow cooker.  So far ive made pork, stew, whole chicken roast, chicken wings and bbq chicken.  ive used both pressure cooker and slow cooker.  So far everything has been really tasty.  I usually cook the meat either slow cooker or pressure (which is fantastic if you are in a bind and forgot to set the slow cooker before work).  Then I take the meat out, put it in a pan and broil it for a few minutes to get a crisp on and baste with BBQ sauce.  My husband and son who is 16 really has enjoyed the meat.  I plan on expanding and trying the other modes."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"So happy with this purchase!!! Everything comes out so tender & juicy without having to turn the oven on, which is a wonderful thing in the summer. I've made everything from pork chops, chicken, ribs, to even baked potatoes. So nice to set it and forget it. It  can saute and then cook in it's own juice without bringing out a separate pan, and have more dishes. Easy clean up too. Love this!! Even has a setting for making yogurt too, going to make some next and have frozen yogurt on hand!!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,Looks nice not too big. We got the 3 QT job.Some good recipes and will replace most rice maker functions too.  Just note that the book is for all pots and if you follow onedo not forget 3 QTS will never hold a 7 QT recipe. Ever!Good appliance.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"No need to rewrite all the great stuff about this product that is all ready written.  Get one...it is a game changer.  Only issue I have is the pressure valve sometimes has to be tipped, turned or nudged to seal.  So I feel a little uneasy leaving once I set it up and go do something around the house or outside until the pressure builds up.  Then all good!!!  I'm glad I bought the 8 Qt; there are only two people primarily in the household with two part-time.  I really like to cook a lot of healthy food on Sunday and eat on it all week and have the extra size to cook for friends.  Like I said..GAME CHANGER !!!!!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Very nice product. I researched and heard stories of how amazing these are, and I would agree. You can cook frozen chicken breasts in 10 minutes. What no one tells you is that it takes 5ish minutes for the pot to become pressurized before it starts cooking. I'm still ok with that, but it's just something to keep in mind. This cooks the absolute best hard boiled eggs. The Shell peels off like a dream. I do like that you can put food in, set a time and walk away. I tend to multi task and over cook things, so this prevents that. They should mention somewhere you need liquid in it before you put meat in it, or it will burn and turn off. Still love it though."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I was apprehensive to purchase this because so many complained about the customer service.  That has not been my experience.  The instructions state that you should run a test with the cooker right away.  I followed those instructions and I had Mount Vesuvius.  Water was everywhere, leaking all around the seal and dripping off the counter.  The popup never popped.  I called the 800 number in the book and a lovely gal talked me through the problem with another test.  The results were the same.  She indicated that the item sounded defective and that I should return it through Amazon.  She also let me know that, if I had any problem with Amazon, to call them back and they would handle the return.  I actually received my new pot the day that I shipped the defective one back- free shipping.  I have run the test and this one is definitely working.  So for those of you who are inclined to purchase gadgets and let them sit around until you are ready to cook something, I highly recommend that you run the test right away as directed.  Even if it is a gift, it is easy enough to repack after the test."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Super easy!  I'm a bachelor by trade and certainly not a chef.  However, I got this thing in the mail yesterday and put it to the test with some teriyaki chicken wings.  I started off by using the saute feature to lightly brown the wings in some oil.  Then poured in some marinade and switched it over to high pressure cooking.  The meat was so tender it was literally falling off of the bone it was so tender.  Two bones even fell out while it was cooking?!  I didn't know that was possible.  I can't wait to see what else this thing can do.  I was debating get a slow cooker for quite a while, but after having this I realize what a poor decision that would have been.  From pressure cooking to saute(ing?) to slow cooking and more, this thing is super easy and gets nice and hot fast.The lid makes a nice secure lock and the pressure relief valve is super easy to use.  Everything seems to be very well built and high quality."

1.0 out of 5 stars,"I think it is difficult to use. As an example the vent description is very hard to read. Or the description how to use it with vegetables is confusing. For vegetables you use the same time as on the stove and you out of control. It take space up, hard to clean. I would not buy it again. So far I had not one single satisfying experience. I bought it 3 months ago."
5.0 out of 5 stars,I absolutely love my Instapot and purchased another one for my best friend.  I’ve already made chicken soup with a whole chicken and beef stew!  It’s very simple to use and easy to clean. A great time saver and easy way to make delicious healthy meals or meal prep for the work week.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought my first instant pot a few years ago and it still works great after tons of use. I bought this one for my vacation home instead of carrying the old one back and forth. Same size as my old one but has a few new features that I like. A yogurt feature, clear markings inside the bowl, a nicer steam rack and a cord that disconnects from the main unit for storage. I love the simplicty and quick result for making soup especially. Throw everything in the bowl, set for 12-15 min and soup is ready!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I started with the 6 quart, but found I often struggled to make everything fit, especially at the holidays. Got this on a black Friday special and I'm so glad I did! It's nice to have the two do I can make two things at once (again, holidays). If you're out going to buy one, get the 8 quart! You'll never have to worry about room. I can go bone-in turkey breast, large chickens, and double recipes with no problems!TIP: If you're going to get ANY instant pot, get the ceramic pot! I almost never use the SS pot as the ceramic is easier to clean!"
4.0 out of 5 stars,"Thought this might be a great add on for the instant pot to avoid adding another appliance thereby saving space, but it takes as much room as a separate air fryer would.  The add on shelf for air frying additional food is really hard to use because when it's time to flip food it's almost impossible to remove and replace because it's hot.  When I'm just using the regular basket it's fine."

Too much time has gone by so I doubt I’ll get any credit for it. I suggest if you purchase more than one, open and inspect right away."
5.0 out of 5 stars,I now make yogurt once every couple weeks with a 1/2 gall of 1%milk and it is fantastic! Heat on sauté stirring constantly till 180-200 degrees then cool the milk to 110 degrees on the counter. Stir in a bit of yogurt from week before (or store bought) as starter and some vanilla if you like. Put back in instapot and push yogurt button to 8 hrs. Want greek style then when done strain with cheesecloth couple hours in fridge.
5.0 out of 5 stars,I have never used an air fryer but thought it would be fun to try. This lid did not disappoint. I made buffalo egg rolls last night and they turned out great! I can't wait to use it more. It was so easy to use and the parts go in the dishwasher which is a huge plus for me.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I am in love with this pressure cooker.  I had bought two from QVC.  The pressure release valve broke off the first one and the 2nd one just died.  So, after seeing reviews and joining a facebook page dedicated to this IP, I bought it the same day the other one died.  I love that this has a stainless insert that the others didn't.  You can brown things in this and then slow cook or pressure cook.  Pressure cooking takes a slow cook recipe and turns it into less than an hour for most things.  Frozen chicken?  Not a problem for this little miracle.  It has a setting for soup, rice, roasts, stew, beans and more.  You can always add or subtract time too.  It comes with an instruction manual and a separate small cookbook.  You can find recipes online all over the internet for pressure cookers and there's an IP cookbook on Amazon.  I haven't done it yet, but you can make cheesecake and bundt cakes in this too.  I look forward to cooking in this Instant Pot"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm new to pressure cooking so I was more than a little intimidated about using it. I found the package directions to be not very useful for someone who doesn't know what they're doing, but there are lots of helpful videos and blogs online. I've only made a few dishes so far, but the baby back ribs were outstanding and so much easier than waiting hours for them to cook in the oven or on the grill. People in the Instant Pot Community have provided lots of meal ideas. There are many accessories on Amazon such as egg stands and spring ring forms for cheesecake. I am going to try a cheesecake next.Update: I loved it so much I bought two!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I am an avid cook and can't believe I didn't know about this pot until very recently.  After reading multiple reviews and recommendations, I went with the 6 qt. size, and find it is just about perfect for a meal or even large quantities of meat that I freeze for future meals.  I have made it a point to use it often in the first month to make sure that it works to my satisfaction and I must say I have not been disappointed yet!  So far in the first week I have made baby back ribs, hard cooked eggs (which I always have trouble getting perfect), pulled pork, potatoes for german potato salad, a mexican rice dish, and steel cut oats in a few different ways (plain and with apples).  The pot is so easy to use and cleans up very easily.  I did buy a few accessories (an egg rack, a steamer basket, and extra silicone sealing rings).  The rings tend to take on the smell of what was cooked in the pot (especially meats), and, although it does not seem to affect the flavor of other foods, it is more appealing to have a non-meat smelling ring when cooking other items.  This way I can switch them out depending on what I am cooking.  I did try the recommended method of using lemons and water in the pot and turning on for a few minutes, but it did not take the smell out completely.  In summary, I highly recommend the instant pot for anyone who wants to cook quality meals in less time and with less appliances.  I have not used all of the functions yet, but this will probably replace my slow cooker, and I love not having to be near the stove to attend to foods as they are cooking."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Are you out of kitchen space? Do you have a ton of doodads, gadgets, and thingamajigs? Yep, us too. We've been married for 25 years and have collected all kinds of ""as seen on TV"" goodies... Well, at least now, I can get rid of some as this is a 7-in-one unit. It has all the latest technology with very little counter space! We use it for nearly every home-cooked meal (when we're not lazy, that is). It has worked exactly as it says and hasn't failed us yet. Love it and it's so much cheaper than buying 7 different apparatuses, just saying!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Purchased this to see if pressure cooking would add flavor without all the salt used in stove-top cooking. My son is on dialysis and salt is strictly limited.  This thing is perfect for limiting salt!  Every reduced salt or salt free recipe I tried was, well, boring.  The first thing I cooked in this was a pork shoulder roast with onions, some garlic cloves, wine, salt-free beef bouillon (kinda followed the recipe in the provided book for beef roast) and it was delicious and tender and moist.  My son was impressed enough to start asking what else could be made in it.  That's a huge endorsement since he had become bored with food in general.  So, a great product for quicker, flavorful meals, but a must for anyone who has to limit salt, but still wants lots of flavor.  I've only had it for a week, but I've used nothing else since for making a meal.  Thanks, Instant Pot!  Oh! And check out this site for some great info on the timing for different foods (I have it on my toolbar!): http://www.hippressurecooking.com/pressure-cooking-times/"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"What can I say - this is an awesome, versatile product.  Adding the accessories are  must - racks, egg cookers, cake pan.  Our cuisine has definitely improved with the insta pot. I've used traditional stovetop pressure cookers in the past - evening seeing the injuries of one blowing up and burning my Aunt.  I never felt safe using the traditional pressure cooker.  I have no worries with this Insta pot and its safety mechanisms."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Best purchase I ever made. Have had over a year and used 3 times a week. Whether cooking frozen burger, frozen chicken, ribs, rice, potato soup or split pea soup, this instant pot does it all in 1/3 the time of other ways. Texture not adversely affected as with microwave. After using for all this time, it still looks new. Am finding this is my go to cooking appliance so much so I’ve just ordered some accessories such as a steamer and replacement lid rings so I never have to stop using my instant pot for a broken seal. Highly recommended. You won’t be sorry."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This product is an amazing pressure cooker. It was very versatile, easy to use, and it cooks very well. This cooker combines the functionality of several appliances into one, so you can save on space and dish washing. So far, I've cooked rice, soup, raw vegetables, and sauces, and I've been pleased with all of them. I bought this on Prime Day for about $55, and at that price it's a steal. Would definitely recommend this Instant Pot."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm so happy with my Instant Pot!  First of all, I love the inner pot made of stainless steel.  It's light and easy to handle, it cleans up very, very easily, and I don't have to worry about aluminum or non-stick stuff in my food.  (These were problems with my old pressure cooker.)  I love the way you can stand the top on the side handles so that you're not trying to find a place for it on your counter. The pre-programmed buttons are great; I've used them for rice, porridge and stew and they did a wonderful job.  I've also used the manual button for my own recipes, and it's pretty intuitive.  I thought my old pressure cooker was great, but this new one is light-years better.  It's like going from an old beater car to a jet plane!UPDATE 12/21/19  It's been over 5 years since I bought this, at $150.39 (inc. tax) and I don't regret paying it, even though the price is so much lower these days.  I've used it about 3 times a week ever since then and is truly the most valuable tool in my kitchen.  It still is like new after over 800 uses!  I keep urging my friends to get one, and with all the sales, they finally are doing so.  Buy it; you won't regret it!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Overall this has been an excellent purchase. I bought the instant pot because I was getting home late and did not have time to cook a healthy dinner for my family. Also when I tried to use the slow cooker the food would be very bland and mushy after 10 hours of cooking while I was away.The instant pot has resolved both of these issues and had other benefits as well. Here's what I have used so far:1) pressure cooking feature- takes longer than I initially anticipated, keep in mind that recipes times start once the cooker has come to pressure. Although it may say ""cook chicken for 5 minutes on high pressure"" it takes approximately 15-20 minutes for the pot to come to pressure when it is filled (to max recommended). That said I can still have dinner ready in under 45 minutes and the food tastes DELICIOUS. It is the opposite of the slow cooker. All the flavors are intensified while still resulting in meat that is tender and juicy.2) yogurt maker- I have made yogurt in the past using a warm oven over night, but the results with instant pot were superb. It is convenient that pasteurizing and making yogurt can all be done in the same vessel. After straining/draining my yogurt through cheese cloth for a few hours you could not tell a difference form homemade to nice store bought greek yogurt.3) saute- This saves work on doing extra dishes. I saute my aromatics and onions first, brown my meat and then set to either pressure cooking or slow cooker. Anything that saves me dishes is great.It is easy to clean and comes with a quick guide for easy reference (I hate having to pull out the manual each time I want to try a new feature) I plan to by another one for my mother."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"If you love cooking, you’ll be passionate about the Instapot. And if you dislike cooking, the Instapot will be tour best friend. Perfect rice, perfect easy-peel hard boiled eggs, perfect pot roast. I was scared of it as my mom had nearly put one into orbit when I was a kid. The Instapot has safety features so no worries. The photo is of my very first cheesecake in the Instapot. It’s puffy cause  I had beat to much air into the batter, but delicious! We’re a family of two and I have an eight quart."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Stove top pressure cookers terrify me, but I thought I would be ok with this electric one.  I am not sure what the logic is behind that, but I have found a winner.  I've had it for about 4 days and made a roast, potato soup, rice and today we have fancy pork chops with potatoes, cabbage and gravy, all made in the same pot in less than an hour.  And the pork chops were slightly frozen too.  I also used it to make vegetable broth from the frozen vegetables that I keep in the freezer.  That took about 20 minutes and I used some of the broth in the pork chops.  We get a lot of produce from friends whose gardens are overflowing and sometimes it goes to waste, but this year I think I will actually get a lot more canned since I don't have to stand over the stove and cook this stuff.  There are lots of recipes on the internet for pressure cookers, so the list of food is endless.  We will probably be eating out a lot less, so even though we will be eating more meat, we will also be eating more veggies, so there are some more good points."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Since 5 Stars is as high as I can give, that is my rating. I would just like to say that this thing has made cooking last minute for a family of 6, so much easier, and way more healthy. I really love my instant pot! I just wish they sold them a tad bigger. I think I need another one because there are so many things I want to cook at a time. Here's a tip though, a couple of times the inside rubber liner got detached from under the little metal bar and my cooker wouldn't seal properly. When this happened, my food didn't cook right. After that event, I make sure that the rubber clear sealing thing is tucked securely under it's little wire before I put the lid on. Not sure why it is movable, perhaps for easy cleaning?"
4.0 out of 5 stars,Love all of it however I wish there was more direction as to how to use some functions and if you always need the air fryer basket or not.  I will figure it out but it would seem easier to have a manual explain the different things you can actually cook in it.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I had a previous 10 quart pressure cooker which did OK until the pot started chipping. I could not get a replacement because the company is out of business. I decided to buy this one since it had good reviews and seem to be popular. I used it the day I got it. I made some pork for tacos. It was great from the get-go.  I love that it has a stainless steel pot, it will never chip."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought a used one. As advertised the packaging was a little damaged. And the product has a slight dent as a result. But I will NEVER be sending it back! This little machine is awesome! We have a small kitchen in our apartment and the Instapot didn't raise the temperature in out kitchen at all. Very important in Phoenix in the summertime. It is also super easy to clean and takes up minimal counter space. I would recommend this to anyone, especially those with small kitchen spaces."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Yes!  Love it!  I found this electric pressure cooker super easy to use.  It comes with a book of instructions with cooking method for different foods, and recipes. One feature I especially appreciate is the stainless steel interior.The Instant Pot makes perfect rice.  Cooks a whole frozen chicken in less than 1 hour, fall-apart tender.  Makes the best barbeque ribs.  For beans, I pre-soak the dried beans overnight, rinse, dump in the Instant Pot and add water just to the level of the beans.  Press ""manual"" (30 min).  They come out perfect.You can culture yogurt, or use the Instant Pot as a slow cooker.  The Instant Pot sits beside my stove, quickly and silently cooking up the main dish while I prep the rest of the meal.  Or I can pop a side dish in there and presto!  Half an hour later the steak is coming off the grill just in time to enjoy fluffy steaming hot rice!  We literally use this thing daily around here."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This machine makes making dinner so much quicker and easier, especially for Full-time working moms I've only tried a few recipes in it so far but my family's favorite is Fall Off The Bones Ribs, I found the video for it on YouTube and it takes about 34-40 min. to make from start to finish and the Instant Pot is idiot proof which is great for me!  I didnt even read the manual, I just looked up recipes and tips on Youtube and Pinterest. I love this machine so much, I ordered another one (this time the 6 in one) for 60.00 on Black Friday so I could cook two things at once and teach my daughter to cook in it. The only difference between the 7 in one and 6 in one is the yogurt making mechanism which I doubt I'll ever use. This would make a great wedding or graduation gift and if you watch it closely, every once in a while the price drops dramatically on Amazon. If you buy this, I doubt you'll be disappointed."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"This unit works fantastic. The only issue is that the required amount of water to produce a pressure seal is WAY more than I like. I'm not a big soup fan so having to put in so much water that everything that it comes out like soup is not acceptable to me. Beans, (from dry in 40 minutes)  Split Pea Soup (15 minutes) , stews, are all good but if I want to cook veggies like squash, fresh green beans, potatoes, corn, etc... you have to put so much water in it to get a seal that you always have soup when you're done. Perhaps steaming is the way here.I have not tried the steam option with the basket though.  I'm sure that with a bit of creative cooking (steaming) , perhaps you could do fish, the veggies,  or a tough piece of meat to perfection.I do use it often and hope to perfect many recipes. A learning curve no doubt."
3.0 out of 5 stars,There is a large safety switch at the inside bottom center of the InstantPot. It's purpose is to detect if the metal 'bowl' is installed. If it's not installed then it should not allow the heating element to create any heat. On my InstandPot that safety switch has failed such that the heating element will produce heat without the metal pot installed. I've owned this InstandPot for about 4 months and have used it about twice a week. It should not have failed that quickly. Perhaps this failure is a 'one off' and not representative of the product in general.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Out of the box and into the rice pan.... ran the test run, then made long grain brown rice for dinner. Was perfect and ready in 20 minutes. Clean up was simple. Some kitchen products just make your life better... this is definitely one."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"THIS IS A GAME CHANGER.I’m in love!! I pretty much only use this thing to cook anymore and I love it. It’s soooo easy to clean and makes amazing food in such a short time!! I’ve cooked a ton of things in this but so far my favorites have been: Mongolian chicken, chili(BEST CHILI IVE MADE!), and a 6.5 pound turkey breast!!!!!!!!!! Can’t wait to make a cake in there soon. I absolutely love this thing!!!!! I haven’t even begun to use it to its full potential and that makes me giddy."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great cooker had this for about 6 months. Stainless inner bowl is a life saver as there is no nonstick surface to peel off. Totally replaces a slow cooker with the slow cooking option, but then can have beans, stews and roast on the table in an hour. There is a learning curve if you are not used to pressure cookers but is a real time saver. I highly recommend getting the Bob Warren cook book, Miss Vickie's cooking under pressure, and Americas test kitchen pressure cooking. all have differing levels and types of recipes for different taste and difficulty. Bob Warren is great for easy recipes but not a big selection. Miss Vickie's gets very complex but is good and some out of the realm of an electric pressure cooker. Americas Test Kitchen is more difficult recipes that are time consuming and need special ingredients but as always taste fantastic.As a down side Potatoes are difficult as the size always vary and cooking times are near impossible to guess. It will cook them to mashed potatoes consistently given enough time. Still this is only one of many foods for the pressure cooker and I love the set it and walk a way function.Over all I love this pressure cooker."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"My wife and i love this pot !!!! Instant Pot has been surpassing our expectations ever since we first started using it.  I always read reviews and i was more than sold by them and couldn't wait to exp. it for myself and 2 mos of using it almost everyday we LOVE it !!! I always used a traditional pressure cooker but my wife never had, so we needed to look for a product that would be safe for her to use, and the Instant Pot was the perfect solution.  She absolutely loves it, because it is so simple and easy to use.  There are so many useful preset programs and very easy to input it manually too.  We have been able to make so many food dishes since we have it and to be honest we have not ruined/burned any food.  The pot seems like it has a brain of its own. We love to setup a program with just a click of the button and literally walk away.  The instant pot automatically puts itself in ""warm food mode"" and equalizes the pressure. So you literally can leave it all day and your food would be perfectly warm.  We love the recipes that come with it and i have been able to find many more on their official website and just by searching on Google for Instant Pot recipes. We have been recommending this awesome product to all our friends and family !!!"
2.0 out of 5 stars,"Meh.  It can cook some foods much quicker, but with a pretty steep drop in quality.  We tried a bunch of recipes when we first got it—Chinese, Indian, stews, meat and potatoes—and were almost always disappointed.  Not terrible, just slightly blah.  Meanwhile other recipes, like for yogurt and oatmeal, take just as long and with as many steps as making them the old fashioned way.  I can see this working for people who don’t have a lot of time to cook and/or need to feed a big group.  But if you enjoy cooking and a great tasting meal is important, look elsewhere."
5.0 out of 5 stars,I am amazed at how quickly foods cook! Frozen meat to delicious stew in less than an hour cooking time means great meals even when I don't plan ahead. Unsoaked dried beans done in 30 min is unbelievable. Couldn't be happier with how our menu will now be expanding. I selected the 8 qt because I like to make big pots of soup & often cook for gatherings. Was tickled to get it at 1/2 price as an Amazon lightning deal. Highly recommend!
5.0 out of 5 stars,"With a fantastic sale on the big 8qt Instant Pot why not? But would going that big be too much for just me and my partner - no it wasn't! This is a fantastic machine and I've used it every day since I bought it. It's not made me younger, thinner or any better looking (the Mountain Three Wolf Moon short sleeve tee did all that) but it has managed to make a fantastic holiday meal, boiled eggs perfectly and is about to make some delicious soup. I've been told it makes rice better than the expensive asian rice cookers (of which I have one, I love a uni-tasker sorry Alton Brown) so I've been anxiously awaiting a reason to make some basmati.But there is only two of us - why do you need such a big pot for only 2 people? First, if you're going to cook something, you're going to probably want to cook for more than one meal. Leftovers are a god send. Bigger also gives you more working space. You can always have space and not need it, but if you need space and don't have it you're out of luck.The only ""bad"" (used lightly) thing about this machine is that ITS HUGE. It takes up some serious real estate on my counter. I had to move a bowl of oranges and some decorative oils that my mom gave me (I can't bring myself to throw them out) in order to make space for it. However if it comes down to bottles of dubious gift oils from TJMaxx or this Instant Pot - the pot is going to win every time. Buy the big one - you won't regret it."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I was a bit intimidated by this appliance, but I decided to dive right on in. My first dish was lasagna soup. I failed to realize tat it takes a few minutes to pressurize before the cooking count down actually begins. So I kept pressing the start button. After waiting several minutes, the cooking counter began I was good to go. Still a little confused on how to clean the lid, as I didn't want to submerge the entire lid under water. I later realized that the rubber seal could be removed along with the metal pressure cap. Overall, it was a good first experience making lasagna soup."

4.0 out of 5 stars,"This is a real review by a real person in real California...The short:I threw away my rice cooker and pressure cooker. This thing is super versatile!The long:Everybody knows that rice cookers are expensive for what we really use them for. Yet we continue to spend hard earned dollars purchasing these specialized tools knowing full well they'll take up far too much counter space just to cook us the two cups of soggy rice that we were praying would pair well with the five dollar roasted bird we just nabbed from Costco right before they closed. It's rice. Learn the knuckle method, keep the lid on and save your money.Pressure cookers are another story. Want super tender beef hoof to simmer in your stew? Try using one of these ticking time bombs that nobody seems to know how to close properly or is just a fruit ninja distraction away from third-degree steam burns on your forearm. That's right...it's 2019 and I just referenced fruit ninja.This Instant Pot DUO60 6 Qt 7-in-1 Multi-Use Programmable Pressure Cooker, Slow Cooker, Rice Cooker, Steamer, Sauté, Yogurt Maker and Warmer by contrast performs multiple food preparations with ease and grace. Rice? Light and fluffy. Beef? Fork tender. Steamed vegetables? My 13-year-old will eat them now. Baked potato? Light and fluffy.French fries? Not so much. But that's why it's important to learn how to cook. You can't expect these machines to do EVERYTHING for you!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"We used our slow cooker, rice cooker and pressure cooker pretty darn regularly.  We are a family of 6 and ""quick"" and easy are key terms for us :)  I bought this because I like how easy it is to function and I can have two items (kept one of my other pressure cookers) where I normally would have 4.  Hooray!  More cabinet space.We use this item all the time and it is very easy to use.  Love that you can braise and then slow cook/pressure cook in it.  It isnt any more or  less wonderful than my other digital appliances -- just very convenient that it takes the place of multiple items."
2.0 out of 5 stars,This pot takes FOREVER to pressurize. Not worth it. I could cook my barley the conventional way and it would be done quicker
1.0 out of 5 stars,"You will feel ripped off when they reduce the price by half as they did recently.  Actually, you will feel ripped off at any price.  The attention this crappy item gets is all hype.  It has only disadvantages compared to a stove if you are not pressure cooking.  It is hard to clean.  It takes a lot of space to store.  The silicon ring will hold the smell of whatever you cook in it.  If you use the pressure mode, good luck.  There is no way to check how done your food is without waiting for it to cool enough to let out the high pressure steam.  Then if it is not ready, you are screwed.  I've only been able to ruin artichokes in it, turning them to mush.  Unless you are willing to let out all of the steam manually (careful not to burn yourself or make a huge mess), then you will be cooking your food for an extra 5-20 minutes while you wait.  Hope that is okay."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Best purchase I could’ve made just before the pandemic! I’ve made beef stew, steamed cod, bbq pork ribs, tender pork chops, and homemade yogurt. It’s been a life saver while under lock down, having to cook almost everything ourselves. Totally worth the money!"

There is a massive dent in the back. It smelled like curry. It also did not come with the trivet. I didn’t return it because it was a hassle but I wish I would have spent the extra $20 and got it brand new. It does work as it is supposed to."

   I was super excited about the product, but once I got it the cook/pressure time and the amount of pressure built up wasn’t what I had expected. Took me over 1+ to cook some pre soaked kidney beans. And when tried beef it just made a mess as the pressure was released. Maybe I got a bad apple of the batch, maybe something was wrong with it. I had to return it and it was a smooth process."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"OK, so my girlfriend and I had been reading about these, and of course we wanted to see if there were any alternatives that were cheaper or perhaps more feature-laden.  I have to say, there's a couple cheaper models, but none with the following (ie RECIPIES!) that this one has.  It's dead-easy to use, cleans easily, and is more useful than I could have ever imagined.  We make bone broth, curry, rice and other grains whole grains turn out great, roasts are AMAZING, tomato marinara sauce is always best home-made.  The list is extremely expansive - google it and you'll be floored by how much this thing can do.  If you're on the fence, let me tip you over!  This thing is without a doubt one of the best kitchen appliance I think I've ever purchased."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"Great product. So far I've used the yogurt, rice, sauté, and slow cooker functions. Had a little trouble getting the timing right on the rice function for brown rice, but that was my mistake. I wish there was better documentation for how to use each function as well as more documented recipes, but there are some good tutorials/instructions online.Experiences with each function so far:Yogurt - works great, made thick Greek-style yogurt. Followed online instructions and then strained the yogurt through a tea towel/cheesecloth.Rice - works alright, still working on finding the right timing for brown rice.Sauté - gets plenty hot enough, gives meat a good sear. Only complaint is that the bottom of the pot isn't flat, it's rounded, so when I put oil in the pot it tends to pool around the sides.Slow cooker - works great, you can set the number of hours you want it to cook at Low/Normal/High heat, and when that time is done it will automatically leave it on Keep Warm.Overall, would recommend. Hope that the next model has more basic recipes and more detailed documentation."
1.0 out of 5 stars,"I am so disappointed and frustrated. The first one I ordered I experienced the same problem. I sent it back because I thought something was wrong with it but the second one is doing the same thing. Every time I try to pressure cook, i get FOOD BURN. I have tried everything: sauteeing first, using the metal rack, warming before pressurising....everything. And each time, FOOD BURN. you have to remove everything, clean off the burn on the bottom and try again.  oftentimes, it happens again...and again...and again...and again.  It must be this brand but i DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS ITEM! By the time it FINALLY works, I could have used my original slow cooker and it would have been finished at the same time."
5.0 out of 5 stars,I adore my Instant Pot! I have used it a lot this winter. It really does live up to the hype. I used to use a regular pressure cooker but it was such a pain and very messy at times. This is awesome because I can use it to pressure cook chicken vegetable soup and then make dumplings in the same pot using it as if it were on the stovetop with the sauté setting. Makes perfect rice and cooks frozen chicken quickly and it is nice and juicy. I can not recommend this highly enough. I will be able to cook hot meals this summer without heating up my kitchen. Love it!!!
2.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased this 3qt unit to use primarily as slow cooker, and occasionally cook rice.  Was looking forward to using pressure cook function.  This is a huge fail as a slow cooker.  After 4+ hours highest setting contents only reached 150F, meaning it is not safe for cooking meat.  I thought it might be defective yet other reviewers have mentioned similar issues.  Am returning unit."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Just used it for the first time.

We were able to eat ""hotpot"" with it when we added more and more stuff into the pot.I'm so happy that I got it!"

3.0 out of 5 stars,"I really really love this ..I""m not one to cook so I only use it for a few things I have learned how to make in it..plus it saves room being a rice cooker and slow cooker all in one..However..my first one came with a cracked handle. No problem..other then having to be patient waiting for a replacement  all was good. I use it probably 5 times a month..maybe less..and now the buttons on the front are starting to not respond. It did it a couple of weeks ago..I thought it was a fluke. Now it did it yesterday and today. I have to unplug it and let it reset. I store it unplugged so it's not always on. I bought it in Nov 2016 and my window for returning ended in Feb. Super unhappy that two in a row were defective and conveniently just a few months after I could return it to amazon. I would give it one star because it's totally unacceptable..but I know I love the product..IF IT WORKED! Amazon..please take a look into these..are you having a problem with them?..I don't know why I would get 2 in a row with problems."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"The perfect pressure cooker.  It's also programmable.  The most useful feature is the yogurt maker.  If you like yogurt, this is a must.  It makes perfect, really delicious yogurt (esp if you use Noosa as the culture starter).  Also very useful for chicken (11 minutes flat) for a quick meal.  Indispensable.Only problem?  unlike a traditional pressure cooker, i can't plunge it under water faucet to cool it quickly.  I wish they add a feature that enables that."
5.0 out of 5 stars,I don't know why it took me so long in life to get a Pressure Cooker. I remember fondly the meals my Mom would make in them during the 70's. Meat would fall off the bone and the tastes were outstanding.  We decided to get one in order to make cooking meals easier and healthier. We stopped using microwaves about 16 months ago and have not missed it one bit. After some research I decided on the Instant Pot. It has great features and looks sleek. I think we ate nothing but Instant Pot meals for the 1st week after getting it. We are constantly amazed at how well it cooks things and just how easy it is to cook delicious healthy meals quickly. Clean up is very easy which is a big plus as well. The complexity of the flavors in the meals is unbelievable. Meals taste like they have been slow cooked for hours when in reality they are done in under 30 minutes in mot cases.  Absolutely love this product. Highly recommend it and Chicken Thighs cooked in it. :)
5.0 out of 5 stars,"The Instant Pot is an excellent machine. Initially I was concerned that the Instant Pot might not do as good a job as my old Fagor pressure cooker. What is really novel and superior in the Instant Pot is that it doesn't have escaping steam. All of the flavor stays locked inside the Instant Pot and not wasted by escaping steam. Another advantage to the Instant Pot is that it never has scorched food on the bottom. All around, the Instant Pot is the way to go once your conventional pressure cooker konks out."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love my Instant Pot.  I'm a bachelor and was intrigued by all of the positive reviews and YouTube videos.  I already own a stove-top Fagor pressure cooker, but hate using it because its such a pain to clean.  I love the Instant Pot because you can put everything in the cooker (even saute/brown the ingredients prior), then push a button and walk away.I am by no means a cook and so far I've made some baby back ribs that came out amazingly well.  I was also a little skeptical about a one-pot pasta recipe coming out as good as it did. It's so easy and in 15mins the pasta is al dente.  I put the leftover pasta in a baking pan and stick it in the oven the next day for baked pasta!  Tonight I finally tried the slow-cooker mode.  I made black-eyed peas with smoked ham hocks and collard greens.  I used dried beans and 5 hours later, perfection!An added bonus is the clean-up.  The inner pot is very easy to clean, food does not stick to it because of the cooking method and the pot doesn't have any protruding handles like my Fagor, so its easy to wash.  I highly recommend this to anyone who wants to be able to cook delicious fast and easy one pot meals."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I am Paleo and have been for years.  The Paleo community often raves about this appliance but I hesitated since I really didn't need another kitchen appliance. BUT, oh my goodness! I wish I had tried this before. I will get rid of my rice cooker, and my various slow cookers, because I no longer need various appliances! I have this AMAZING appliance. It is primarily a pressure cooker - which, by the way, may be the single best kitchen appliance ever, but also a rice cooker and a slow cooker. The slow cookers I had were for different types of things, including small and larger and then large. This instant pot can slow cook small quantities as well as larger amounts with ease and without incident. I used to have to use a small one for things like steel cut oats, but this does it beautifully, the oats were cooked perfectly even though it was a small amount in a large pot.  Rice is cooked better than in my rice cooker, and much faster too! BUT the best is the pressure cooker, I think I am addicted to pressure cooking, it is so fast, the food looks beautiful and tastes delicious. I made Beef Bourguignon the other day, it cooked in less than 1 hour (versus 6-8 on the stove) and tasted delicious. My kids even commented that it tasted much better than the slow cooked anything.  I am hooked, you need this appliance!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I am a male old timer who loves to cook, how did I ever live without this beauty! I love using my Instapot , its safe and so easy to use and clean. I cook hard boiled eggs , two dozen at a time for pickling,and boiled peanuts in half the time as before. There is no limit as to its uses, I make the best Carolina BBQ with my pressure cooker. I had this one for 6 months and can't imagine cooking without it .  Great buy."
1.0 out of 5 stars,"The pot will burn on the bottom within seconds when making beef stew even tho it has enough liguid. Burn mash keeps coming up, no clue why. Each time you have to take insert out and scrub it down. Pain the butt."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have to say that this pot is worth every penny! I bought it with some doubts because back then in 2015 it was 150 bucks including tax. So I was afraid that I was not going to use it as much. Boy this thing is simply magical in the way that it cooks food. The food always comes out good and full of flavor but best of all, it is fast and efficient. I have cooked beans, soups, chilies, steamed vegetables, cooked one pot meals or meat by itself. I lended to my mom a few weeks ago because she wanted to cook beans and when I asked for it back. She would not give it back to me! I did not have the heart to just take it back from her. She has a childcare and cooks meals at her house so I know it will get used up more often I used it and trust me I used this thing a lot!! Now I'm without my baby and boy life has not been the same. I'm thinking in buying another one again."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"First off, I'd like to say this was a Treasure Truck purchase and I was very disappointed because the offer said this would come with a $10 coupon for whole foods, but of course they were out of them. The ad didn't say first come first served on the coupons, I could've picked it up on the first day had I known, if they ever really had those in the first place. I feel tricked and I hate that. It was to much trouble to return the item as I bought it for a gift and needed it the next day.As far as the instant pot itself, my friend loves it! I got one for Christmas, haven't used it much yet but what I have made in it (rice, spaghetti sauce, stew) was easy and turned out well. And just as important to me, it's easy to clean! Even when I sauteed the meat it cleaned up just like a nonstick surface, but without the negative health concerns with actual nonstick pans."
3.0 out of 5 stars,"Kinda caught in the middle on this product.It is my first pressure cooker and the actual performance does not match what the manufactures statements show.The main concern is the amount of time to reach pressure takes significantly longer that stated in the included booklets.During the initial test and several usages since then, all have taken much longer than expected to reach pressure.The good thing is the product works good after reaching pressure.  So overall I'm caught between a 3 and a 4 star rating.Cleanup is a pain.  Not sure why, but food sticks to the bottom of the pan.  I would have expected it not to be so bad with all the moisture.So my  conclusion is the product is slow to reach pressure, but seems to pressure cook foods okay.I like the results so will plan on the extra 10-20 minutes to reach pressure when cooking."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"The Instantpot is one of those items that you hear so much about that it makes you wonder if you're missing out by not joining the club. I was a little hesitant to first make the initial purchase because I didn't want another kitchen item just sitting around collecting dust. I also kept stumbling on recipe after recipe for pressure cooking and I decided, why the heck not? I watched a few YouTube videos before I started it, which you will find some that are more informative than the instructions the pot comes in. Not only does it cut cooking time in half but a lot of meat cuts taste so much better when they've been pressure cooked! I keep experimenting with so many vegetables, legumes, and meats and I haven't been disappointed."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"Overall, the Instant Pot is terrific; however, I gave it 4 stars because it would be nice if the manufacturer would include instructions.  I thought I was purchasing an Instant Pot similar to the one I already have and that setting the timer for pressure cooking would be the same - well, it wasn't and no instructions were included in the box.  Needless to say I had to Google how to set the timer!  I shouldn't have had to waste my time doing this as the manufacturer should always include an instruction book with every product that they sell.  It's just common sense."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Pros: Arrived on time packaged well. This pressure cooker is truly user friendly.. I am shall we say culinary challenged... However this was very easy to use. Like infomercials show, you can literally throw stuff in the pot and great food comes out... Read the User manual - its pretty short and explains all the key things. I also watched the review video... I love that this replaces a slow cooker as well but I will probably always use it in pressure cooker mode.Cons: being new to pressure cooking this was probably my fault but I tried to do the accelerated vent mode...stupid me tried to grab the vent from the top and rotate it to the venting position... don't do this.... :-(  Thank goodness I had used a dishcloth.. It still kinda hurt for a second..  use tongs and grab the end of the lever... Steam vents directly out the top of the valve...  or just wait the 10 minutes to let the unit vent on its own..  Otherwise there are no cons that I can see.."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"I love my instant pot with one exception, sometimes it wont seal properly and it will make a hissing sound. This is easily fixed by quickly opening and closing the lid, but if I walk away and forget, it can cause problems with the cooking process. It may just be my individual unit."
5.0 out of 5 stars,We finally decided to give this item a try.  Boy was my wife surprised.  It takes a bit to learn the features and how to use it but now that she has she really loves her Instant Pot.  She especially likes how much time is saved and how quickly she can cook things that previously took hours to cook.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I got rid of my pressure cooker, rice cooker, slow cooker and didn't buy the yogurt maker I was looking at.  This one DOES IT ALL!  I make hard boiled eggs in it, the yogurt turns out well, the rice comes out perfect and it's a much better slow cooker than my old one.  I don't wince when I use it for pressure cooking, it never makes me nervous to open the lid.  I love it, it's easy to use and easy to clean.  It is very big, but I have a spot for it now that I got rid of all the other things!!I purchased this in July of 2017.  The inner pot started having some issues.  I contacted Instant Pot customer service and in two days they have shipped a brand new inner pot to me - ZERO COST!  Great product - GREAT customer service!"
4.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my second review.  The first was glowing, but reality has set in.  The inner pot, although 18/8 stainless, is hard to clean.  It takes a lot of scrubbing to remove food stains, which is strange for ss and would seem to indicate a lesser grade of ss.  Perhaps it is recycled ss.  It also seems to be pitting, but when I contacted Support about the issue, I was told that I had voided my warranty by using it in Australia, outside their warranty area.  Before the discussion reached that point, it seemed that pitting was not unusual, so be warned.  I had only cooked chicken bone broth once, before noticing the pitting.  Nothing acidic."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Oh, my goodness! Buy one! I have used mine about 8 times now and it's perfect every time. I have made a roast chicken, BBQ Ribs, a pot roast, a blueberry bundt cake, boiled eggs (twice), and Guinness Stew in it. Each time the meat has come out fall off the bone tender and flavorful. Everything is moist, intensive in flavor and just all round delicious! And it's quick. Things are done in no time. And it's SO easy. I never got the hang of the stove top pressure cooker but this thing does everything for you. It sautés, boils, roasts, bakes and more that I haven't tried yet. You're just gonna love it. Oh, and did I mention how easy it is to clean? Like a snap. That's because of the high quality stainless steel pot. We plan to take to the road full time in our RV this fall and I will NOT leave my instant pot behind. It's going to be my go-to kitchen appliance."
3.0 out of 5 stars,"I would give 5 stars because I love Instant Pot, have a 6 qt. too. I couldn't figure out why my condensation collector wasn't staying on. I've had this for 7 months and realized one of the plastic clips that holds it in place broke off. We keep it on the counter so nothing can bump it and the location of the side clips are so far underneath that nothing could bump against it and break. The only thing I can think of is it wasn't well made and it just fell off when I wiped with a damp cloth. Disappointed for sure, don't want to use it in case the collector is needed and condensation drips all over our counter. We loved our mini, just made beets in it and always use it for rice."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"A learning curve to this appliance and it can be a bit fussy getting the lid on.  For meat products time saving is amazing.  Another great benefit is that it doesn't heat the house for the summer months.  For non bean vegetables it seems actually slower.  Great for a 4/6 person household if looking to freeze portions I would need a bigger one.  I would buy this product again and consider it for gifts.Update 2 plus years later for the last 3 months I use it almost everyday needing  large quantities of no salt  or spices chicken broth and also flans for easy eating. I have done meatloaf,chicken recipes ,potato,egg and corned beef,ribs etc.  Still do not see the use for steaming vegetables etc except for potatoes but it has become more necessary than a oven or stove. I do  not care for the sauté function and have never used anything but manual high pressure . When it breaks I will replace it immediately the only kitchen item  I use more frequently is a small kitchen knife."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"My wife uses this pot around 2-3 times a week. We have a family of four with 2 hungry boys. She uses it to make mexican, indian, korean, chinese, italian, soups, stews, etc. It's way better than a crock pot because it cooks much faster and this is the biggest deal. It tastes great. Way, way, way better! So as I guy, i'm a big fan because it tastes as close to restaurant quality as it gets. As a matter of fact sometimes, my wife's cooking tastes better than restaurants. And I know she didn't spend a lot of time in the kitchen to get that quality of flavor."
5.0 out of 5 stars,Probably the best thing in my kitchen! I wanted to try this appliance since I’ve heard so many good things. I’m so glad that it came out to be true and I actually get excited to cook and try new recipes. I have a pretty busy schedule with school and work so it’s always nice to come home and set this thing to make dinner while I hop in the shower. Everything comes out tasting great with minimal effort in cooking. Was tricky to learn at first but now I can’t cook without it!
5.0 out of 5 stars,"My first Instant Pot - and I love it so much.  I use it often.  My favorites are mashed potatoes, beans, lasagna soup, baked potatoes, and rice.  It really does lock flavors in and it’s so fast.  It was extremely helpful for holiday dinners and the keep warm function is one of my favorite features.  The best tip I have is to purchase a good cookbook featuring Instant Pots-I bought Kathy Hester’s The Ultimate Vegan Instant Pot Cookbook which has an excellent how-to section that walks you through each step.  Having a good instructional cookbook was very helpful to me and helped give me confidence to use my Instant Pot."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Sorry, can't rate durability since we've only had our Mini Instant Pot for a month.  But, having used the saute, pressure cook, and slow cook modes so far, WE LOVE IT.  It's just the right size for the two of us and doesn't hog counter space.  With apps like Yummly and Pinterest, there's a wealth of recipes and usage advice specifically for this machine, and your diet de jour."
5.0 out of 5 stars,I purchased an 8 qt. earlier.  I purchased the smaller one to cook rice and grains in and off the stove.  I purchased a pot-in-pot and make muffins and cake in it now.  Love this little cooker.
3.0 out of 5 stars,"Overall its a good product. You do have to play with the recipes to get what you want. Comparing to the ones I have used in other houses this was my least favorite. The bowl is not nonstick but it's not that hard to clean. I wouldn't choose this one again, but I'm not trowing away either."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've used this 8,000 times since I've gotten it. I use it for simple recipes and complicated ones. I use it when I have no idea what to make for dinner. I just search for ""instant pot"" and whatever I have in my fridge, and I've got tons of ideas, most of them ready in under an hour. It's a miracle! This is as close to a Star Trek replicator as I'll ever get in my lifetime."
5.0 out of 5 stars,The Instant Pot is an outstanding kitchen appliance. I bought 3 of them- one for me and one for each daughter. I have used it with great results and have only watched You Tube videos then tweaking with some ingredients- the manual is still in its sealed bag.I highly recommend spending $20 and getting a non stick inner pot- it was money well spent and gives a good back up if you need an extra pot.
5.0 out of 5 stars,If i'da known about this product before-I might have become a chef :-)  Now people actually think I can cook. I find it super easy to use and you can always just watch a quick YouTube video if you don't want to read manuals. We do super simple things with it that we especially love- like cooking frozen chicken breasts in 15 minutes but we also make pulled pork and loved the braising capabilities. The possibilities are endless. This would have been so amazing to have when I lived in a really hot climate because you don't have to heat up your house in the summertime.  It really  makes the food tastes so much better and especially Meats where it seals in all the juices.  I now make the best homade chicken soup in my instapot from  a recipe i found on the internet. Another favorite is a recipe cooking brown rice that I found online and it's the best brown rice I've ever tasted so we are eating a lot healthier too now.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"The IP works better than advertised. I have the mini.  I’ve done ribs, roasts, chicken, beef soups, bean soups, etc with great results for a guy who’d yet to cook beef I’d serve to people.  Easy to use, big buttons, constructed well.  Its now my go-to kitchen accessory.  Heed the safety directions when pressure cooking, the included recipe book is great too."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Makes the best beans ever.  I have been using a recipe from Food Network for Black Beans but just hitting the Beans button for timing.  Speed is phenomenal I hated soaking beans over night this takes care of that.  I used to be scared of using a pressure cooker now I use it everyday for rice, oatmeal, beans, lentils, vegies and cooked fruit; if I have a dislike in using this device it is for meat.  I think it sucks the flavor out of the meat even if I brown it first, cook in wine, broth or saute onions with it.  I have tried numerous recipes and they all have that watery non taste even with great tasting sauces.  The sauce tastes great but meat YUCK.  I have made some awesome soups.  Brown rice is always perfect."
2.0 out of 5 stars,I still can't figure out how to use this thing. I found it doesn't really work with Alexa and the 4 things I have made weren't good. I am discouraged - and I have been cooking for a very long time.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"We love this.  We use it several times a week.  I've read negative reviews and I don't understand them.  It's easy to clean and if you care for it properly its amazing and I see it lasting a long time.  We've never had a problem with the seal.  Read the directions and clean everything you are supposed to clean the way you are supposed to clean it and you will be very happy.  Cooks in minutes, cleans up in minutes and everybody's happy.  The pot itself is the real deal.  They didn't cut corners there.  Be careful not to drop the pot as the top rim is what seals in the pressure with the silicone gasket and you don't want it kink or get bent.  So don't tap your utensils on the rim of it to clear them off either.  I'm happy we got it.  If it craps out at some point in the future I will surely get another one."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Versatile product. It takes 3 hours without watering before the beens. Its is an amazing product that will help u a lot at the kitchen. We are a housold of 2, but my husband eats for 3 lol, and we prefer not cook every day, intead of try to cook once a week. With this huge one, it still have more space. When we cook with this pot, it is for more than a week and also we do not use all its capacity. This is for an extensive family or an industrial kitchen."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased this to replace an good ole pressure cooker that I received as a wedding gift.  It still worked great, just not on my induction stove.  So... I researched and ended up with this brute.  Awesome sauce!!!  Love the amount of styles of cooking it can do.  It is big enough to hold a meals worth for my 4 teenage boys and 1 darling daughter, and my wife and I.  Sometimes we even have leftovers.  I've slow cooked a fantastic pot roast (I put it in from the freezer), some sesame chicken (again from the freezer) and pressure cooked it to tender perfection, and a few other casseroles that included sautéing veg and browning meat before the slow cooking.  I love that I can do some of the precooking in this before setting it up as my crock pot... LESS dirty dishes!  Who doesn't Love that!?!  I really like this thing, so I'll be buying again for Christmas gifts and birthdays.  Sweetness!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I LOVE, LOVE this item..if you haven't tried these new electric pressure cookers,try this one,they're SUPER fast and easy to learn( after the first use you'll totally get it) ,if you can unplug things and turn buttons you can learn to use this...LIQUID is the secret,they're nothing like the old explosive pressure cookers,I've cooked full meals in less than an hr. thanks to this instant pot.My "" I hate cooking"" Daughter in law turned me on to this appliance,I didn't think there was much about cooking ,I might learn from her ;)., There are many to choose from,I did the homework,this one was no better or worse than its competitor name brands  and the top of the line ones rating weren't so much better for the price differences,. as I said ,I do love mine,its reviews are true.this truly a set it and forget it appliance"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I’m a mom and I don’t really have time to cook so this is the best thing for me. I use it for baby’s food and for our food to. Wake up in the morning make oatmeal for us and than just wash it, put lunch (rice, chicken, beans, beef or whatever) and go out shopping or do whatever I have to and come back to a nice ready warm lunch it’s just amazing. I love it! I’m so sad I didn’t have this before in my life."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I am recently getting back into cooking (my husband past away and he always took me out to eat). I had not cooked for 30 years. It is like learing to cook all over again and the Instant Pot makes it much easier for me. I love it. My grandmother, who raised me used a pressure cooker (the old fashioned kind). I got tired of TV dinners and wanted real food. The Instant Pot allowed me to cook and it tastes wonderful. I even bought a 10 quart and cooked a turkey and the works in it. Fantastic Christmas meal. I wish the Instant Pot made a 10 or 12 quart. I had to send the 10 qt Gowise back - the lid was not working properly. I have had NO PROBLEMS with my 6 qt instant pot. ""LOVE IT"""
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Despite the fact that you’re basically cooking with an IED, this thing is awesome! Did my test run and after that cooked a fantastic corned beef brisket with cabbage, carrots, and white potatoes in less than 45 minutes. I’m a single dude who was looking for healthier eating opportunities without the hassle and this is it."
5.0 out of 5 stars,I love love love this instant pot. I have made some yummy stuff with it and it cut cooking down half. Recommend this for anyone with a family of 5plus
1.0 out of 5 stars,Great tasting food however after second use the silicone around the lid absorbed all the smells from the spices that would not come out. I used it several times after and the smell became unbearable that I had to store it in garage to avoid spousal conflict. I wanted to save my marriage so I returned it.
5.0 out of 5 stars,I love my Instant Pot.  This is my second one since the last one died after 7 years.  I have bought them for all 4 children because I think they are so convenient.  They replace so many other appliences that I have had in the past -- rice cooker; crock pot; steamer.  I use this appliance at least once a week from making whole grain cereal to making a pot roast.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is yet another review praising the instant pot. So I will be brief, please see below.Pros:x. Literally ""set and forget""x. A lot of settings to choose from - I haven't even gotten to use some of them yetx. Distinctive sounds for functions such as: lid on, lid locked, lid unlocked, lid off, power connected, power on, end cookingx. Bonus, the handles on the sides can actually be used to hold the lidHeads up:x. It's not their fault and this didn't affect my review, but during quick release, the steam escaping is rather loud"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"We use this all the time for many things. This is a good brand and better made than some of the cheaper brands, this is our 2nd one and we love it. Much better than our 1st one which was a cheaper brand and did not last long. We were able to return 1st one and replaced it with this one which is a better quality. Our 1st one was purchased at a retail store so when we needed to replace it we wanted this brand. After pricing them, this was the best price we found and made the purchase. Glad we did and to hope have many good meals from it."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I make bone broth in this monthly, and it's so easy. I'm sure it does many other great things, but this is what I wanted it to do, and it does it well. I just throw in a bunch of bones with a cut up carrot and celery, 1 tsp apple cider vinegar, 1 tbsp fish sauce, and fill it 2/3 full with water (covering bones). Run the soup cycle for 120 mins. I pour it into a beer pitcher and the rest goes into a silicone muffin pan that I freeze and have a bag of broth discs for later!"
4.0 out of 5 stars,"Wife didn't ask for it and I didn't tell her I was buying it for her. There wasn't any occasion so I scored 100% on the surprise-her-with-a-no-reason-gift scale. She loves it and won't stop trying new recipes. Minus one star for the steam release design. Tiny lever lends you to open the steam with your fingers in the path. Learned it once and won't forget it. Note to manufacturer: ""ouch"", consider redesigning the steam release lever into a larger paddle so we can flick it."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have wanted one for a while now, but my husband was totally sceptical about getting one and that we would actually use it. We use it all the time and I think he is now an instant pot convert. So versatile and easy to use. Don't be afraid of pressure cooking. It is safe and easy if you follow the instructions. give it a try, you won't be sorry."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have used the Instant Pot for over 1/2 the meals that I cook in a single week.  I cook chicken, pork, beef, rice, vegetables and I've end done a brownie. Quick and easy! Did you forget to start the crockpot for dinner tonight? You can cook a tender pork butt for carnitas tacos in 40 minutes or veggies in about 74 minutes. The heat-up time takes about 14 minutes. I have yet to use the other buttons on the machine.  Also, the pan is easy to clean.  Make sure you have at least 1 cup of fluid in the pot or it will not work."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I highly recommend this product.  I am seriously considering buying a second one so I don't have to carry this one back and forth to our vacation home which is at high altitude.  The unit performs flawlessly as a slow cooker, too; the saute feature REALLY works (not a wimpy temp) so I can efficiently brown meats and some ingredients for better color and flavor before starting the slow-cooking process.  Oatmeal and rice have come out tasty with no fuss.  It is very easy to clean.I have had pressure cookers in the past, but I greatly prefer this one because it is more versatile, doesn't have to be monitored (yeah!) and is helping me simplify my possessions:  Bye-bye rice cooker, slow cooker, and prior pressure cooker :-)  I hesitated (who really needs yet another new kicthen appliance???) but the enthusisastic reviews urged me forward.  I am happy and relieved to report I have absolutely no regrets about this purchase."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"Bought a 3 qt version for my husband and I.  Seems to work well.  Have used several recipes, some as slow cooker, some as power steamer.  Makes good yogurt, which should pay for itself over time.  Does take a bit more time than I thought as it often takes as long to remove the steam as it does to cook."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I use this several times a week and love it, for example it has replaced my slow cooker for making stews and soups and is better because you can't smell your food cooking for hours. You can't smell anything from the pressure cooker until you let the steam out. It is very easy to use too, for the pressure cooker you can choose preset times like Stew/Soup that will auto set to 35 minutes which you can alter to have more or less time or just choose Manual and choose how many minutes you need. Once you choose the time it changes to ON and after a few minutes building up heat and pressure it then starts your time counting down. I must admit I am a little scared of usual pressure cookers that you place onto the stove, I worry about how much pressure is building up but with this machine it does it all for you and takes all that uncertainty and worry away."
4.0 out of 5 stars,Bought Duo 6 qt to replace old pressure cooker and to add to my mini. Mini isn’t large enough to cook a whole chicken. This size is perfect. I won’t be replacing my mini with the 6 qt. It is much heavier and uses more wattage. Probably great for a family or for larger quantities or large roasts.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I'd wanted an Instant-Pot for awhile but was afraid it would just be one more unused kitchen appliance (like the juicer) and this 8-QT beast is large enough to collect dust.  I was wrong to worry.  There is almost always something going on in the pot: beans, beef stew, pumpkin chili, lentils, chicken & dumplings, SO many soups.  I still prefer rice in a rice-cooker, but might try baking in there soon."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I got this product in January 2018. I am still learning new ways to cook. So far, I love the taste of potato salad cooked with Instant Pot for the first time. I chose the steam function to cook the potatoes because steaming is always better than boiling. It is supposed to make the food taste better without losing nutrients and umami. Then, I successfully made Greek yogurt, pork ribs, azuki bean paste and so on. What I like about the Instant Pot is that it pressure-cooks by programming. You do not have to stay with the pot to keep checking. It cooks so fast and powerful. Food is usually much tastier than conventional cooking. However, I prefer the rice cooked with Japanese rice cooker (Zojirushi).  Instant Pot rice was more sticky than Zojirushi rice, and I lost lots of rice stuck in the inner pot."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This has been a very happy purchase. It was my first pressure cooker ever. I like the safety features, because it makes me feel like I cannot mess it up. It cooks well and you can control the time and method of cooking. Also, easy to clean. I am contemplating purchasing a second one for when I travel. Its good for cooking large portions or just a large meal in general."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"All of the other reviews describe it better than I can. I was looking to purchase a cheap crock pot for roast/chili/soup and decided to splurge a little and buy this instead. Oh man, it's amazing!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have used this appliance more than any other gadget I've owned. I continue to be amazed at how many things I can cook in the instant pot. Tonight I steamed salmon, in 3 minutes, to make salmon patties. I quickly cleaned it and cooked 4 lbs of chicken breast meat for the freezer. I love that I can saute' onion and meat in the pot, then add other spaghetti sauce ingredients to cook and know that it will automatically kick in to the warm cycle until I'm ready for it. Rice comes out perfect every single time. It is also very easy to clean.I found it most helpful to get cook times and ideas from the instant pop website, as well as you tube videos people have done.You won't regret this purchase. A friend of mine just bought a second one so she can have a couple things going at once.My sister has Huntington's Disease and hasn't been able to chew meat for about 3 years. I got my BIL an instant pot for Christmas. He pressure cooks roasts and other meats that are so tender that she can safely enjoy meat again.There's only one thing I would change if I could: the words on the lid ""venting"" and ""sealing"" are just embossed in the plastic and very hard to see for more mature eyes:) I'd love it if the letters were silver to stand out a bit more."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Works as advertised!! Made perfect potatoes, hard boiled eggs (which basically fell out of the shell at start of peeling), and fantastic black bean soup all within 24 hours of purchase.  Recommend using web to find many good recipes & learn about detailed use.  Not difficult to use at all!!  Who knew there is an IP world out there??!! Will review again after more use of my new IP with complex food recipes."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I am very happy with my instant pot. It cooks meals quickly and nicely. I had older pressure cookers that would have to be watched constantly and must say the instant pot is much easier to plug in and leave. I have often, because of it's larger size, doubled a recipe to freeze leftovers for another meal or meals. The slow cooker and rice cooker have now been eliminated from my kitchen. I recommend purchasing. I would also recommend purchasing extra rubber rings. The odor from my lamb roast has still lingered on the original ring though I've soaked the ring in lemon juice, baking soda and dawn detergent and let it air dry."

5.0 out of 5 stars,"I can't say enough good things about this product.  I jumped on the bandwagon after friends raved about this item, but sometimes I'm disappointed to actually try things like this for myself.  Not this time.  I am so impressed at the quality of the food that can be made here, the speed at preparation and the versatility.  For me, one of the highlights is being able to put in frozen items and have them done within an hour (including the time needed for pot to heat and pressure to build.) I now have my freezer filled with meat in the right quantities to have dinner on the table quickly even if I have forgotten to thaw.  It has opened up a whole new world of recipes, though I have made some of my favorites in here too. There is a bit of a learning curve to using this appliance but well worth the time and effort. This will be a much used appliance in our household!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love, love, love the Instant Pot.  I did the test run for the steam function and it took longer (by a few minutes) than expected, but worked exactly as described.  I've used it twice as a slow cooker.  What set this apart from the standard slow cooker is the saute function.  The saute function allows 3 different settings, low - normal - high.  The normal was good for sautéing onions and garlic with relatively minor attention.  The high was, obviously, faster, but required more attention to stir to avoid burning.  The removable pot is a sturdy stainless steel, which is one of the reasons I selected the Instant Pot in the first place.  I did not want a ""non-stick"" surface which many of the other ""comparable"" pots are made of.  I love the ease of use, the variety of settings, and the flexibility.  I am excited to use the remainder of the features, but so far I am sold.Hopefully this review isn't premature, if anything changes with more time using the Instant Pot, I'll update the review."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I though I might be able to use one of these, but wasn't sure. I hardly ever use my stove anymore. You can cook almost anything in the pot. One suggestion I would make is to buy extra silicone gaskets immediately because they really take on the scent of your food."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"Massive learning curve to make this work. About as intuitive as PC-DOS 1.0. Once you get over the learning curve I suspect very satisfactory results, I am not there yet. Your first couple of meals may not just be a PIA but you may want to send it back. TIMER has little to do with cook time, it is for delayed start but you would never know that unless you dig deep into the instructions, I never did. I suspect however this may be a great way for me to cook with the right cookbook. Tonight's diner was a total mess. My son ended up making vanilla pudding for diner. I dumped the beef stew out before my wife got home, just did not want to hear it tonight while watching the Cubs beat the Indians in game two of the World Series."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Holy cow.Listen, if you dont have one of these my heart aches for you. THIS THING. Is enormous. And it does ALL THE THINGS. our first meal was a 5lb roast cooked from frozen in 20 mins. It was fork tender and delish. We have 5 boys and this is literally my saving grace. Hubs works days and I work nights. With school and work schedules we dont have hours to prep and cook a meal. My family can have hearty healthy meals in MINUTES. super duper easy to clean as well."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Oh my goodness! This is actually more like ten stars! This has made cooking so much easier, especially on those rushed and busy days...um, every day it seems! There is a learning curve for an electric pressure cooker, but there are online community groups ready to answer questions. Once you take the plunge, you'll wonder why you didn't do it sooner. Really. I got this on a Black Friday sale, so I was fortunate in that respect. Who doesn't like a sale? It really is worth its weight in gold. And have I mentioned that not only can you make supper, etc, you can make CHEESECAKE. Yup cheesecake. And it comes out creamier than any I've ever made in the oven. C.H.E.E.S.E.C.A.K.E,  Need I say more?"
1.0 out of 5 stars,"Used this about 8 times and it stopped working. Piece of junk. Just went to use it one day and nothing, no power at all, no reason either. If you are like me and thought you would keep it around for certain things be careful, by the time you use it a few times the warranty will be up. Too expensive to only work 8 times. Thumbs down."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I LOVE my Instant Pot! I live in Europe due to my husbands military career and use it on a large transformer with no issues thus far. My only word of advice is to let the pot cool naturally instead of venting it while the pot is full (it did not pass the ""max"" line, it was maybe two ticks under it) as you might end up with the juices coming out the top. I've never used any product like this, not even a pressure cookie, so this was apparently a rookie mistake, so heads up to any other newbies out there. This did not sway my love for this pot. I have a very busy life and sometimes being on the Paleo diet can make cooking dinner a bit of a chore when I get home late and need to get dinner done. Being able to cut time off the amount of time I spend cooking, waiting for dinner to cook, and the number of pots and pans I have to wash is amazing! We will be recommending to friends and giving it as wedding gifts! I just can't say enough about this product!"
4.0 out of 5 stars,"I do love my Instant Pot, but I did want put a word of caution out there.  I have used my Instant Pot 4 times since purchase, 2 out of the 4 times I have cut myself on the lid.  The first was a small scratch as I was installing the rubber gasket after washing it.  While I was putting it in place, I rubbed my finger around and scratched it on the the metal where the lip sticks out farther to allow for the locking motion.  The second time I was trying to unhook the guard on the steam release valve to make sure it was not blocked and my finger slipped, causing a deep gash and resulting in 3 stitches to the side of my middle finger.  My hand slipped causing it to slice right against that stupid lip again, this time quite deeply.I am a normally very careful cook, but wow, that metal is sharp!  Be careful!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Wow, I love this Instant Pot.  By brother got the Air Fryer lid for me and they both are wonderful.  I have used it 3 times since my purchase a couple weeks ago and so far everything is coming out great.  And the air fryer lid is awesome.  I have not used it yet for air frying, but I have used it for baking after pressure cooking my meats to give it that baked look.  Great purchase!"
2.0 out of 5 stars,"The instructions for the different cooking method ie slow cooking, pressure cooking are not very useful. The stainless steel insert is not stainless. The pressure cooking function is nothing like a pressure cooker used on stovetop. I would not recommend for foods that you want cooked soft."
1.0 out of 5 stars,"Ok people, this is not a do all appliance, don't get suckered into this fad like I did.  This is an electronic pressure cooker nothing but a pressure cooker.  let me explain.  Crock Pot, NO far from it.  This unit only heats from the bottom in a stainless steel pot, not the sides.  I have placed a fully thawed boston butt in it for 10 hrs and it did not cook it like a crock pot.  Crock Pot heats on the bottom and the sides of a ceramic insert which heats evenly which makes it more effective in cooking large pieces of meat, which we all know crock pots work, they've been around for awhile and their cheap. I can put a frozen boston butt in a crock pot for 10 hrs and it will be cooked with no issues.  Pressure cooking meat is not the same as grilling, broiling or slow cooking.  The only piece of meat that I,ve had success with is back ribs which only take about 25-30 minutes, but there not as flavorful as slow cooking, why, it forces almost all the flavor out of the meat.  I grill them after that.  Its still not the same as slow cooking in the oven or on the grill.  3lbs. of frozen hamburger, NO, don't waste your time.  I can cook 3lbs. of frozen hamburger on the cook top, in a pot with a lid faster and I will challenge anyone to that.  Ok lets get to pressure cooking, can this unit pressure cook, yes only if you use 16oz jars, 32oz no.  3 32oz jars will fit but the lid will not go on.  I have the old pressure cookers that have been handed down to me and I used them.  Anyone who has canned before in a pressure cooker knows that a trivet is placed on the bottom so that the jars don't come in direct contact, keep from burning the bottom portion of your food.  This unit comes with a trivet and if you remove it, the lid will go on. Not worth the money.  6-1, 7-1, 8-1, 9-1 units, it's all BS.  You can cook everything that this unit cooks in a crock pot but 10x better.  And don't watch YOUTUBE, their just wanting viewers.  DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is one of the best Christmas presents I ever bought myself! Instant pot makes such great rice, soups, slow cooked stews, steamed veggies, steel-cut oats, pressure cooked meats etc.and a no non-stick pot to flake off in my food! I'm in a little bit of heaven! Whoot!I love, love, LOVE having so many different functions to play with!TIPS:You do NOT need a glass lid for the slow cooking method (just be sure the pressure valve is in the 'unsealing' position).When doing thick dishes such as sauces like pizza or spaghetti sauce or thick gravy like meals like Swedish meatballs or pasta dishes (etc.) use the low pressure setting because there will not be enough liquid to come to full pressure at the high setting and your R2 unit will have a spittle fit trying to come to pressure if you attempt high pressure with those types of thicker food recipes.Cleaning is a breeze and if you *do* burn something a bit on the bottom of the stainless steel pot, just soak overnight with some vinegar and baking soda and hot water and then gently scrub clean.Yes, the silicone gasket will smell like whatever you cooked for a few days so after you wash it, keep the lid slightly askew so that it can breathe and air out a bit. No worries though about flavor transfer from the silicone gasket to the next food you prepare. Trust me, it never happens and I've been using pressure cookers with silicone gaskets for years.When doing the quick-release method and you don't want steam soaking your ceiling (or your recessed lights above your cooking island), simply order a pizza (yes, you read that right) and save that little three-footed, white plastic thingy they put in the center of the pizza in the box to keep the cardboard from sticking to the cheese. Place that white plastic pizza thing right over the top of your instant pot steam vent and then drape a medium to light weight kitchen towel over that and it will control the steam a bit better.Happy cooking!"

Does food get wasted because by the time you get around to making dinner, everyone is too tired and not hungry any more?  WE LOVE OUR INSTANT POT!  It is incredible and so versatile.  It was a great gift and we use it all of the time!!!  HIGHLY recommend this product!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This replaced my 40 year old crock pot.  It is an extremely versatile item, one of my favorite and most used machines.  It makes soups quickly, even using dried peas or beans.  I like the ability to brown meat before making stews, cooks and tenderizes ribs although I prefer to finish them on a grill.  Give this a 10!!!!!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,We have had our instant pot for about two months now. We had a pressure cooker Xl that we bought thru the web site. Did not like it. Was cheaply made and hard to clean. Used it about five times and gave it away. So we were skeptical about the instant pot. Long story short we love it . It is a high quality item. The stainless pot makes clean up a breeze. There are literally thousands of recipes on line. As with any new toy- there is a learning curve. My advice is to buy the large size as you can only fill it 2/3rds full. Get one- you’ll be glad you did
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This thing is just awesome. One of the best kitchen gadgets we've ever bought. Have used it weekly for 3 months now and no problem. Great quality. Main thing we use it for is chicken wings, pulled pork, mashed potatoes, and pork ribs. I feel like we've just cracked the surface, though. Here's your perfect wing recipe. 1.5 lbs chicken. 3 cups of Frank's Red Hot. Manual timer for 5 minutes, after it beeps let it rest for 5 minutes. Release steam. Place on a wire rack and put in the broiler oven for 5 minutes. Flip pieces over and cook another 5 minutes. Perfection. It takes a bout 40 min total accounting for the time it takes to build pressure, but they are delicious and super easy. For an even better treat, finish them on the cool side of a charcoal grill for 5 minutes each side instead of the broiler."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I, as I'm sure many other have, saw the Power Pressure Cooker advertising but, after further investigation, I saw how disappointed many people are with that product. Wanting to experience that kind of cooking I sought out reviews of other electric pressure cookers and the Instant Pot received glowing reviews.Upon receiving the Instant Pot, I put it through its paces. I made a wide variety of soups, meats, complex meals and yogurt. I could not be happier. The function and speed are wonderful. Just yesterday I made a terrific corned beef brisket in an hour and it was amazingly simple. I do particularly like the pure, fresh yogurt in the mornings; knowing that there are no additives or fillers and it's exceptionally easy to make.The stainless steel interior cooking pot is heavy duty and very easy to clean.The browning (sauté) function works exceptionally well. That was a huge complaint about that other product.There are a number of excellent online pressure cooker websites. There hasn't been a single recipe I've tried that hasn't turned out wonderfully.The only complaint I have is that the manual could have more detail about the functions and provide better explanation but I have found my way.My employment requires me to work long and often random hours. I was resorting to a lot of fast food. The Instant Pot has given me a route back to healthy eating and I am sure I will continue to use it for a long time to come."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm in retail and have been telling all my customers, friend and family about this glorious pot!! I should get a referral fee lol. This think has made my life so easy. Like I said... in retail..so.... subhuman work hours and long stressful days..needless to say I don't feel like standing over a stove for an hour or two when I get home...  with this.. I can take a whole frozen chicken, some seasoning, bell pepper, onion, garlic, a few carrots, red potatoes and celery and add a little water, close the pot and an hour and 10 min later have the best soup ever. The other day I cooked a five pound pot roast for an hour!! Usually take 5 in the oven..and it was so juicy and nice... literally falling apart....I could've made pulled pork tacos... also like the fact that u can leave the top off and saute in this pot and it's big enough to fit a wh ok let slab or two of ribs. This is a must have for all u busy ladies."

I love being able to pop rice, veggies, potatos, or small portions for a great dinner.  I appreciate the warming feature that, instead of continuing to cook, it keeps it warm instead.  Simply an awesome feature.  So easy to use with the cheat sheets included."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"My new favorite appliance! I had been waiting to get an instapot for a while and glad I grabbed this one. It’s the best machine I own. The vesatility is wonderful and the time it saves me is a great help. As far as safety goes it’s perfectly safe IF YOU FOLLLOW THE ONSTRUCTIONS. I can’t stress that enough, I’ve used traditional pressure cooker/canners(stove top type) and the risk is the same.That being said, if used responsibly it’s not a danger.The yogurt making setting has to be my favorite setting on this too. I can make thick Greek yogurt at home for a fraction of the price I’d buy it and in my opinion it tastes better too. The other features I really like are the ability to sautée in the pot too, saves me from extra pots and pans. There are lots of other preset options too that are helpful but these are my favorite."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"We like this pressure cooker a lot.  Made baked beans and yogurt so far. Both my wife and I like the safety features built into the pot.  As stated by others the seal now smells like baked beans hence only 4 stars.  When I decided to buy a second seal as recommended by Instant Pot and others I found out if I just wanted one, because I live in Alaska, the shipping would cost me $55.00 for a 4 ounce seal.  However, If I bought a package of two for just $4 more I could get Prime shipping for free.  This seems very strange to me even though I am used to being charged more for living in Alaska. To their credit Instant Pot does show a shipping charge of $55 for one item shipped to Alaska or Hawaii. I do think the inability to manufacture a seal the doesn't absorb the cooking odors shouldn't be that hard to overcome and would certainly enhance their product greatly."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Yep, you need this!. I had 4 slow cookers, 1 pressure cooker, and a yogurt maker. Now I have this and couldn't be happier. It is easy to use and a God send. I don't have to soak my dried beans overnight anymore. Beans go from dried to perfectly cooked in 45mins :-) I LOVE BEANS! Tough cuts of meat? They can be perfectly tender in under an hour with this pot. The only cooker you will ever need. Also, you can sear your meat in the pot then turn it on slow cook; how great is that?  Definitely my best buy of the year (also I am 3 years behind the trend) I would recommend it to everyone. Even those who don't know how to cook."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love cooking again. I cook most of my food from scratch....beans, grains, veggies etc. Before the Instant Pot all of this took a very long time and did not always turn out successfully.With the instant pot cooking takes a fraction of the time and the results are so much more satisfying. Everything cooks to perfection whatever function I choose.There are many Instant Pot recipes available on the internet so it is easy to get started. I have even begun cooking Indian food which I would never have tried before the Instant Pot."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"So what you say?  I have my own chickens and those of you who are lucky enough to get fresh eggs know that they are incredibly hard to peel.  Five minutes in the instapot and they are perfectly done and are easy to peel!  That alone is worth the purchase price.  But then again, I really like hard boiled eggs.  Have made really good rice and a few other things.  Not a great cook, but this takes the place of my other crockpots, rice steamer, etc. so I am happy."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Took a chance and bought a 6qt Duo IP for myself and really like it.  It’s changed my life in a way because I cook differently now with it.  Over many years, I typically cooked the same things - the same way.  I consider myself a good cook but traditional perhaps.  This thing offers more variety and the dishes have been outstanding.  I’ve used it probably a dozen times now with very good results.  If you’re hesitating, don’t.  My first attempt was beef stew — came out so good I’ve been asked to make it again & again!  Fun!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"My only complaint is with the instructions. They leave a lot of unanswered questions. Such as:  When cooking meat and vegetables together, which should go in first?  Exactly what is the purpose of the strainer/basket inside the pot?  I cooked pork chops in the pot with Good Seasons Italian Dressing on them. They were delicious and the meat fell off the bone but I would like to brown them next time. When and how is the best time to brown them?  If you could issue new, more comprehensive instructions, they would be appreciated."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I really like cooking with the instant pot. I love being able to pressure cook a meal in less than an hour. I just finished making a thick chicken barley soup in 14 minutes. I let the pressure come down naturally and voila a nice comforting soup. The book comes with instructions and some recipes. However, you will find a tremendous amount of demonstrations and recipes on youtube. In my opinion, much better than the recipes supplied with the instant pot. The instructions are simple and the instant pot is easy to use. When you order this, start watching some of the youtube presentations so you can be ready to use your appliance. We all have appliances that don't actually get regular use. However, I think once you start using this appliance  it will be one of  the most used appliances in your kitchen. In my house the appliances I use the most are my vitamix blender, Cuisinart 3 cup food processor, and now my instant pot."
5.0 out of 5 stars,Easy to use and clean. It makes perfect brown rice (24 mins on high with vegetable stock yum) and it came with a handy reference sheet for various food cooking times which is now hanging on my fridge. I wish I bought one of these years ago.

JUST today for dinner,  literally in 35 minutes a full pot roast with two huge potatoes,  carrots,  onions,  garlic,  celery  -  cooked and ready to eat.  P E R F E C T L Y  D O N E  !  The potatoes and carrots were really nice and soft.  The meat was 100% done throughout and the taste of all the flavors together......  YUM !The day after she got it,  she had made a dozen ""hard boiled"" eggs.  She said it took 7 minutes start to finish and were the easiest eggs to shell she has ever made.  PERFECT and the shells came off easy in large pieces.... something you want for deviled eggs so they don't look partially eaten !  :)"

5.0 out of 5 stars,"Recommended by friends - and I thought, even if it’s all hype, at least so get a good rice cooker - after using it for 3 months (for 4+ main meals a week) I can honestly say the hype doesn’t do this kitchen tool justice -Simple things like hard boiled eggs are perfect with yokes cooked to perfection (and we adjust it for family members tastes) - rice is perfect - but the meal possibilities are out of this world and cots cookingbtimes way, way down.Even the more complicated stuff like yogurt becomes easyI put of getting one - don’t make that same mistake - this kitchen tool is a real game changer"
3.0 out of 5 stars,Would love to give this five stars but the lack of instructions explaining settings and not even a good reference for cooking different meats as an example is a shame great it has a button for poultry are we talking a whole chicken or wings definitely a learning curve that could easily be solved with simple instructions
5.0 out of 5 stars,"At first I was afraid to use this because of the old pressure cookers exploding. After I read the instruction booklet and an internet article written by Simplyrecipes.com, I had full confidence in using this lityle cooking robot!  The first item I made was Spanish rice. It came out perfectly!  I am looking forward to using my Instant Pot in the future.  I know it will cut down on cooking time and we will be eating much healthier. I highly recommend this item."
3.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm sure it works well, but I unpacked it then returned it. I like to cook and freeze large quantities, so I bought this 8 qt. heffalump. It's huge, and my kitchen is probably average in size and storage. I analyzed my main cooking methods; gas range and saute, steam, wok, or dutch oven for slow cooking. I also work from home and don't need an appliance with an automatic timer or the speed of a pressure cooker. Many people love their instant pots, but I love working the flame while I cook and would not use it enough to give up the space."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I used stove top pressure cookers for many years then decided to upgrade to an electric model. The first one I bought was not an Instant Pot, it was a different brand. I liked it, but it quit working about a year after I got it. I decided to try a different brand and went with the Instant Pot based on Amazon reviews. So glad I did. The IP is definitely better made than the previous brand I had.I cook a lot of long grain brown rice, yet I could never get it just right in the first electric pressure cooker I had. I have had 100% success in the IP. 1 and 1/4 c. broth (or water) per cup of rice, 20 minutes on high pressure, natural release.My one concern was that the pot would be difficult to clean as my previous cooker had a non-stick interior pot but I have had no issue with anything stubbornly sticking in the IP, not with rice, BBQ ribs or anything else I've thrown at it so far. It's also awesome for hard boiling eggs. No muss, no fuss, perfect every time and the shells peel off effortlessly. This is one of my favorite kitchen appliances."

After the testing, I did a pot of brown rice, and it turned out quite well.  I like to make refried beans, so this will do the job very well.  I got it for a decent price, so I really can't complain.  Nice product."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Ever since I bought it, my mom has been using it everyday.  It's super fast to cook for Chinese food which usually takes us 3-4 times of time.The only reminder for user is you might want to season the food after done with cooking.  My mom once made Chinese beef stew soup.  She accidently seasoned the whole pot too salty which she found out afterward.  And it results the beef tasted like rubber.  The heavily salty sauce made the beef harden.  Traditional way of cooking, we ""fix"" the taste while cooking.  However, you can only know the result after you are done with pressure cooker session.  So be careful on the seasoning/saucing..."
1.0 out of 5 stars,"I know, everyone loves them, but I hate this thing. If it actually worked, it would be amazing.  I’ve had 2 different ones and neither consistently come to pressure. Sometimes I have to mess w the lid, sometimes I have to mess w the valve.  It is so annoying bc by the time you notice that it is randomly venting somewhere, your food has basically been boiled to death.  There are like a million tips on what to do if it won’t come to pressure.  Why don’t you just make a product that works."

5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is hands down my favorite pot in the kitchen.  When people visit, I show them this appliance - it is that good.  I love red beans but I hate to wait half of the day for them to cook on the stove or all night in a crockpot.  I can now take dry beans and serve them in an hour's time.  Tender and full of flavor because the flavor is not lost by boiling it out.  So far I have also made roast including being able to brown it in the instantpot.  You will be able to cook a whole chicken with meat falling off of the bone in 35 minutes after it reaches pressure.For so long I used to be afraid of pressure cookers because as a little girl, my mother ruined two ceilings when her stove top cooker ""blew up.""  This pot has so ,any safeguards that I am not concerned at all.  It is simply set and forget.  Since the food cooks under pressure, it is hard to smell the food while it is cooking another plus for certain foods.I looked at a lot of cookers before deciding on this one.  I am extremely happy with this purchase.  When I get some more money, I want a second one because with this pot, you can eliminate your slow cooker, steamer, rice cooker, and not be tethered to the stove when making soups and stews."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I am really enjoying this pot. I had wanted a pressure cooker but had been waiting because my Mother's old pressure canner had to be so carefully watched, and I had heard of the dangers. When I saw this I finally decided it was time to give it a try. I am very glad I did, I put a roast (or whatever) in and go about my other work. When I come back a great meal which normally takes hours and observation is done to perfection. No more tough roast beef for us! Any cut comes out tender. The only thing that still gives me pause are the reviewers who claim their pot didn't last. However, I suspect they didn't read the instructions. I noticed that the book says if you make items that are thick like gravy for instance, it sticks on the bottom and overheats the pan ruining the sensor. Not the pots fault the operator who doesn't read."
4.0 out of 5 stars,So far so good. I'm not sure I fully understand how to use this yet but I've used it twice (it has taken longer to cook than what I've read it's supposed to take but I think that has more to do w/getting used to the settings and how to use it than it does w/the actual cooker) and have been satisfied both times. Not too hard to clean either. I couldn't decided on the size and went with the 8. I have a family of four and this is PLENTY big.
5.0 out of 5 stars,I got this for my mother for Christmas and she loves it.  She has tried many meals and always has extra's to freeze into TV dinners for nights she doesn't feel like cooking.  She loved it so much she bought one for my son who had tried a friends and loved it so now he has his own and brags about it all the time and can't understand how I can live without having one.  My Mon and Son trade recipes about what they made in it all the time.  I guess I might just have to get one for me!
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is the greatest cooking pot I've ever purchased and used. I will be getting rid of my crockpot! A pork tenderloin with pink Himalayan salt, pepper, onions, garlic, and water cooked in less than 30 minutes and was so tender it could be cut with a fork. The resulting broth made a fantastic onion soup. I also cooked pork ribs in about 25 minutes and they were ""fall of the bone tender"" and very tasty. Today I made chili with grassfed hamburger meat in less than 20 minutes.  One of the greatest features is that you sear the meat right in the pan before you pressure cook it. It is entirely automatic and has buttons to push for all different kinds of food. Meat, Soup, Saute, etc. I LOVE IT! HOW DID I EVER LIVE WITHOUT IT? And clean up is super easy. There is no mess involved!!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love love love this time saver. I've had it for a couple of weeks and so far each dish I've tried has been better than the prior one. It cleans up easily, it's simple to operate and I've made some amazing Ribs, roasts and Swiss steak...All in less than an hour. There are tons of recipes on Pinterest and a great blog I found called... Pressure cooker convert. His Swiss steak is one of the best meals I've ever made and I've been cooking for about 40 years. May gift one of these gems to each of my siblings at Christmas. Well worth the $100."
5.0 out of 5 stars,Haven’t used it yet but my sister has one n it’s amazing n the price was better than the stores ! Since then I have used it an love love love it!!
5.0 out of 5 stars,"If you don't have this item, you NEED it. We farm and raise our own chickens, they are typically a little bigger than the ones you find in the store but they just fit in this 8 qt. It used to take me over FOUR hours to cook a chicken in the oven (wasn't kidding when I said they are bigger!), I can get it done in this Instant Pot in 90 minutes and it will be FALLING off the bones! This makes meal prep so much easier. I commute for work (I work off the farm) and don't get home early meal time for some. Having to cook without this I wouldn't be able to have a meal ready until much later in the evening unless I was reheating, when it comes to roasts, chickens,etc. Now I can start it right away when I get home and still have a full meal at a decent time."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I had a Wolfe Gang Puck 6 quart version and upgraded to this.  So happy that I did.  I don't know how I lived without one.  My favorite thing in the kitchen! I am always using it for soups, complete meals, mashed potatoes and you can even put in frozen meat!!!  Takes no time and even less time than running out to a fast food joint! I love it so much that I bought all three of my adult daughters one!"
1.0 out of 5 stars,I have had this a little over a month..only by a few days..I have cooked in it twice and now it has a short or something but it keeps cutting off in the middle of cooking..beyond frustrated.
3.0 out of 5 stars,"I have been meaning to write this review for about a month now. I ordered this product due to the amount of dry beans I cook. I was drawn to it for it's quick cooking times. It has not disappointed me in that regard but I have been disappointed in it's quality. One day it looked fine the next the lid was cracked extensively. It's hard to say what happened to it. I'm not sure if it was already compromised and maybe I just didn't notice until it was worse (w/ 2 little ones 4 and under details are often missed) or from twisting the lid on and off. Regardless, I would take this possibility into consideration before purchasing."
5.0 out of 5 stars,My old electric pressure cooker of  a different brand died so I thought I'd jump on the instant pot train.  Great move.  This is one awesome cooker and canner.  Will fit 3 quart jars if configured properly away from valve.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"The promise that chicken and even roast beef could be perfectly cooked very quickly enticed me to buy this 8 quart cooker. I tried it out immediately on a Costco-sized roast, which I first spent a few minutes browning in a large skillet. The pot quickly heated up and then returned the perfect roast 35 minutes later. I simply closed the lid and pushed the meat button. Unlike all other methods of cooking, there was no smoke or heat generated into the room. When done it took less than a minute to release the pressure, and there was the roast without a hint of pink and quite tender, moist and tasty!. It was cooked on the small rack that comes with the pot, so the meat was not boiled. I look forward to making basil clay pot chicken in this, a task I have avoided for years because the clay pot technique is very time consuming. It does result in tender juicy meat, the kind this machine easily and quickly produced for a roast. This is truly a revolution in cooking. Amazing."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"The Instant Pot is better than I had expected! As a college student, it allows me to make meals extremely fast and have leftovers. I usually am stuck eating some microwave meal or going out to eat but with the Instant Pot I get to make real, home style food like pulled pork or meatloaf in large quantity for the week. It’s good for more than just meat too, you can boil eggs, make yogurt, cook rice, etc. I can make meals and be set for the week. I really suggest this to other students or new graduates because in total, a meal takes around a total of 20 minutes max. As students, we don’t really have a whole lot of free time to spend meal prepping and cooking, so the faster the better. I have had no problems and everything has cooked through evenly. Clean up is super quick because it is stainless steel so I don’t need to scrub for a long time or let it soak overnight. And it doesn’t take up a lot of space so it fits in almost any cupboard. It comes with easy to understand directions, one touch controls, and even a few beginner recipes that I appreciated because I didn’t really know where to start. The front has buttons and a timer that make for stress-free cooking. I would consider this one of the best Christmas gifts I have received due to the convenience and almost impossible to mess up even though I don’t know my way around the kitchen. My only concern is about the steam so keep your hands, face or any other part of your body away from the release valve. I love that I don’t have to babysit while I am cooking, I can walk away and finish up my homework without having to worry. It is also nice that I can join Facebook groups for meal ideas instead of having to shell out more money for cookbooks. Overall, the price tag is worth it due to the time this appliance saves and the ease to cooking it has given me."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"If you have never had an electric pressure cooker you don't know what you are missing! I had one for years and when it broke I decided to buy the Instant Pot because it could be used for several ways of cooking. I bought the 8Qt and I was not disappointed. I don't care what cut of meat you put in it, it will come out tender. I brown it and in no time it's done. If your a working person you can have your meal on the table in no time, I use this almost daily. The pan cleans up easy but, I also bought the non stick pan. Now I am looking for all the other pans for it to use for baking and steaming and whatever I can find. This takes the place of so many other appliances, so you won't have your counters cluttered up . I can't say enough about how much I like this. I found the lid a bit tricky at first but, now I know you just put it on backwards and it fits, something I think they could have mentioned. At any rate do yourself a favor and get one you won't be disappointed."
5.0 out of 5 stars,This is my second 3 qt mini instant pot. I got it for the yogurt function that I didn’t have on my other one. I often use both of them at the same time to make dinner or dinner while yogurt is making or dessert while dinner is making..... I love it and do most of my cooking in it!
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Bought myself, plus my 2 daughters an IP. We're group texting now all the time about our newest awesome recipes, and we're on several IP FB sights. I pondered between these and an air fryer. I posted a FB question for opinions and the IP won, hands down, so this is what I bought. We LOVE ours!!! Plus tons of stuff you can buy to use with them on Amazon."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"If you're still considering which model - for simplicity, THIS IS THE ONE!  We've used this appliance at least 6 or 7 times in the short time we've had it and it works perfectly for our needs. We bought it primarily for pressure cooking so were not interested in the models that have many, many features. This model had the fewest and we really like it. It's very EZ to clean which is an added bonus."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"Purchased this on Thanksgiving of 2016. Took us a few weeks to start using it , but then once we started we have been avid fans of the Instant Pot. For us using Pressure cookers on the stove top is a daily occurrence. But the Instant Pot changed things a lot.To give an example- Channa Masala an Indian dish would involve my wife soaking the chickpeas overnight , then pressure cooking it , then using another pan to saute the ingredients , add the spices and make the dish. Now with the Instant Pot - she just soaks it overnight ( it definitely is a must for chickpeas) , sautes the ingredients in the Instant pot , adds the chickpeas , sets it to Bean mode and we are done.Indian cooking seems a lot simple these days !!"
3.0 out of 5 stars,"Can't beat the price. However, I'm not sure if I'm a fan of this product. I am an owner of a crockpot and pressure cooker. The stove top pressure cooker gets to pressure quicker. As far as the rave about you can saute in this and then switch to pressure cooker is all hype as you can do the same with a stove top pressure cooker. I've made a slow cook meal in my crockpot and the instant pot (as a slow cooker), side by side and the meat in the crockpot was tender, not so with the instant pot. Will explore more. I don't like that I can't view my food when it is in the slow cooker mode and I don't plan on investing in a glass top which is sold separately."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Since I bought this, it has made dinners so much easier. Cooks foods so fast. I come in from work and turn it on and have dinner ready in under 30 minutes. The clean up is even easier. I used to be all about my crockpot but this takes the cake."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"My wife had been wanting an Instant Pot for quite some time, so we researched several brands. Based on other online reviews, we settled on the 6 quart 9-in-1.We were a bit concerned about it being difficult to use. However, the user manual is easy to follow and it is pretty much fool proof.  It also has several pre-set buttons, which makes it easy to use for different meals.Prior to owning the Jnstant Pot, my wife was using a slow cooker to make bone broth. One of the signs of good bone broth is that it “gels” after it cools. The first batch of bone broth we made with the Instant Pot had the best gel consistency we have seen. And, we ran the same set of bones through a 2nd time and got a SECOND batch of great bone broth.We have cooked 3 or 4 meals in it so far, and they all turned out great. It takes a little while to heat up before the pressure cooking starts, but overall it saves so much time and the results have been delicious. Meat is tender and food is flavorful.I highly recommend."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love this thing. We make a lot of broth, bone broth and soup in my house. Basically at the end of the week, right before grocery shopping day, we try to use up the last of our pantry items and throw together some sort of soup/casserole type of thing. Now I can do a complex meal like that in under an hour without having to plan hours in advance. Fridays are the hardest days to strategize meals, it's the end of a long homeschool/both parents work week. And we ALWAYS have pizza on Friday. My daughter was recently diagnosed allergic to dairy and Fridays, lately, have been a real struggle. This instant takes the work and the waiting out of a decent meal. I love it!! It's my most favorite kitchen appliance!!"
3.0 out of 5 stars,"I emptied the box with the pot and cord, etc. As I was assembling it, I got the the part where I am supposed to connect the condensation part to the outside of pot. Try as I might, I could not find such a part. For good reason, It was not enclosed. I also see that the pot should have had a ladle. Now I have a pot w/o an essential part and what am I supposed to do? Return it?"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is a great tool for the home chef. While there are so many things it can do, I've only tried a few so far. But, I haven't had a fail yet. It's very easy to use & the accompanying instructions are very clear. Beef recipes work really well & it makes excellent soup stocks in a fraction of the time compared to making it on the stove top. It also does a great job with rice but I have to say, most of the chicken recipes I've tried have come out a little dry but that's my only complaint."
1.0 out of 5 stars,"The lid I received I gave as a gift, and the recipient asked me how to work it. Well, it didn't work, even after watching a bunch of YouTube videos. When we plug it in it will say ""OFF"" so I know it's getting power, but that's as far as it will go. I've tried calling tech support but their hours don't correspond with mine.Update: I'm stuck with a lemon. The return policy of 30 days expired so they won't honor my request for a refund or replacement.  I bought this after reading their product description for compatibility and my model LUX-60 wasn't on the non-compatible list. Customer Service sent me a list (the same one on their product description) and said I was out of luck. This is the worst customer service I have dealt with and will not recommend them in the future."
5.0 out of 5 stars,Gave this mini size instant pot to my daughter for a Christmas present. She wanted the small one because she cooks for 1 or 2 people and wanted something smaller to store. She loves it. Plenty of auto settings. Likes the ability to sauté or pressure cook in the same unit. Great for making hard boiled eggs. They always come out just right and are easy to peel. She also loves the nom nom paleo cookbook “Ready or Not” but that’s another review!
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love my instant pot. I live in a tiny home and have no stove and no cookware. This is the only cooking device I need other than my electric fry pan, which I seldom use. Makes the best rice ever, slow cooks meat for my dog, makes nice baked beans.  I am glad I didn’t spend my money or tie up space with a slow cooker because instant pot does it all."
1.0 out of 5 stars,"I have the 3 QT and was happy with it, but thought I should invest in a bigger one so that I can cook for friends too. I use it to cook my dog's food as well. All of the meals I've ever made in the 3 QT do NOT work on the 8 QT. Everytime I turn the pressure cooker on I get a ""food burn"". I'm thinking about returning it cause it's causing me more anxiety and cleaning than anything else. A piece of garbage."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I am a widow and cook for one. I would cook large amounts in my 6-Qt Instant Pot and then freeze it. I like that I don't have to cook such large amounts and still have the convenience of an Instant Pot. I love the concept and was able to get rid of my egg cooker, rice cooker, pressure cookers and crock pots!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love cooking with it. Both my wife and I have odd hours for work and are usually exhausted but still care about decent meals for the kids. Throw some frozen chicken breasts in some low sodium broth, cook for 15 minutes, then throw in the veggies and potatoes or pasta for 3 minutes. And you have yourself a meal in less than an hour. Keep in mind it a takes a bit for the counter to start since it doesn't start until it pressures up. I sometimes speed things up by using hot water for the broth and soaking the veggies in hot water as I prepare it all. Casseroles, stews, chilli, pulled pork, and much much more. Makes my life easier."
2.0 out of 5 stars,"Directions were so convoluted, it would take me three months -- at least -- of daily use to finally be comfortable with it...if then.Extra messages at the bottom of each page of the cookbook were unnecessary and actually prevented completion of text on one of the recipes.I may have had a couple other responses, which I included in my ""reason for return"" message, so you can retrieve that if interested in researching."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"So far I've made garbanzo beans, refried beans, pot roast with vegetables, artichokes and rice in this, I absolutely love it.  First off for dried beans if you don't want to soak them there is a ten minute method for this explained in the instructions to ""soak"" them then to cook them all of the way takes about another ten minutes.  All of the vegetables I have cooked in this, my wife agrees, taste sweeter than the canned or conventional method, seems odd to say that garbanzo or kidney beans are sweeter, but they are.  Not only is this far quicker, but it is very nice that you set it and walk away then come back when it beeps to done food.  My other concern about clean up is a non-issue, the stainless liner cleans very easily or goes through the dishwasher just fine."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"it took a long time to buy my instant pot. My niece convinced me i would use one being a Vegan. She was right. I bought the mini duo.  My niece sent me the Vegan instant pot cook book. Wonderful for beans. Rice comes out perfect. cook dry chic peas fast to make hummus, which saves a lot of money. I watched utube videos when I was not certain about something when I first started cooking with it.  All I can say its worth the investment. Amazon put mine on a real deal before Christmas. Always remember safety comes first. Take time and read to learn about it."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is a very useful appliance for me. I'm looking forward to sautéing in the pot and directly proceeding with soup making. I made chicken broth in the steam function; easy, quick, delicious.The unit is sturdy and well made. The stainless steel bowl is heavy duty and very well made.  Based on reviews I also ordered extra seals to swap these out for sweet or savory recipes.  I hope I don't regret not buying the 8 quart but I was concerned about size/storage space. I highly recommend the 9 function. It gives extra functions that were important to me."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"My favorite kitchen appliance, after the air fryer. We use this almost every day and CONSTANTLY on the weekends for food prep. I even make my own yogurt which I thought sounded ridiculous until I started making it and discovered how good it is, making for a cheap, healthy snack for the whole family.We use it for chili, soup, boiled eggs, meatloaf, mashed potatoes, and much more. Its really great in the summer when you don’t want to heat the oven."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've heard about these for years. Finally pulled the trigger when this was on sale. So far made chicken and another time brown rice. Its so easy and fast! Such a life saver for our family. Plus it is super easy to use, everything is labeled. I also was impressed with the safety of it, I was nervous but after seeing how its built i wasn't worried."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I made this purchase due to my coworkers raving about how much they love their Instant Pot and it not only lives up to the hype, but much more. Being gone 12 hours a day while working I love to prepare dinner, place in fridge and when I get home it’s on the table in less than 30 minutes. Everything I have made has been nothing short of amazing! It’s just like a slow cooker meal of 8 hours done in 30-40 minutes (depending on weight of meat) is absolutely fantastic! I love the sauté feature, then add my other ingredients. There are only 2 of us, but I love the 8 qt. size for the leftovers for next day or to freeze. It scores a 10 from my fiancé and myself!"
3.0 out of 5 stars,"Overall, we had a mixed experience. The Instantpost was very useful and considerably cut the cooking time! It looks good and we were overall impressed by the programs. However, it broke down in about 1.5 years after purchase. It just stopped heating although all the buttons and programs seemed to be running fine! There was absolutely no water or other external damage, not any other type of abuse. We first contacted the support and they generated the ticket after making me perform a heat test to confirm that the appliance was not heating. Then, we received a follow up email and were asked to provide screen shot of amazon receipt, the stickers on the appliance including serial number and model number, pictures of the heating base and the inner pot (when kept upside down). Following this, we again received a prompt response conveying that since the the warranty had expired, therefore, they cannot do anything. They just offered a $10 discount for the replacement base which typically costs $54 on the company site! Would have loved if the InstantPot was more durable!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm one of those people that gets a kitchen gadget, uses it once, and then it collects dust somewhere. Totally not the case with my Instant Pot!! I use it several times a week. It makes cooking brown rice ten times easier, cooking meals in less time than a slow cooker - but with the same tasty results, it pretty much does everything I want it to do. It's easy to use and clean. I highly recommend grabbing one of these to add to your kitchen arsenal.  I haven't tried all the functions just yet, but I've used a good handful of them with various recipes. It's also WAY lighter than my slow cooker, and way easier to clean. I never knew I needed one of these until I got one on a whim. HIGHLY recommend."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought this for gift giving because I own a 6 quart instant pot. As a matter of fact, I also bought a 3 quart instant pot for myself because the 6 quart one is too big for three people. I use it almost everyday. I have made rice, bIryani, all kind of lentils, taco beans and even yogurt. A must to have in everyone's kitchen."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I just have to say how much I love this. I purchased on on a black Friday and figured I give it a try since everyone has been raving about it. It's been 2 months and I have used the instant pot 4-5 times per week and love it. It has changed my cooking life!  I love making homemade soups -chicken enchilada is one of my faves...the way the chicken comes out perfect and shreds easily is wonderful in such a short amount of time.  I have made quinoa, rice,  steel cut oats, boiled eggs, taco meat, chili, chicken teriyaki and bone broth just to name a few. There is a little learning curve but I found tons of videos and recipes to help. I've recommended this to everyone now!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have used the Instant Pot several times since I received this purchase.  Easy to use, easy to clean.  Works great and the price is right.  I am not a big user of kitchen appliance ""gadgets"", but this pressure cooker is going to get a lot of use from me. Will I stop using my stovetop like a lot of other people?  Most definitely not, but my slow cooker is probably going to go into deep hibernation because of this little goodie.  It's so much easier to cook a stew in this after work, instead of trying to get everything prepared before work in the morning to go into the crockpot.  Like it a lot and once I've tried the cheesecake recipe that everyone raves about, I'll probably really love it!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love this!! I cook with it almost everyday. This would be awesome for someone without a stove or oven. I was able to replace five appliances out of my cupboard, a crock pot, slow-cooker, rice cooker, pressure cooker, and another fryer/cooker (the instant pot cannot be used as a fryer). Excellent gift for newly weds or someone who likes to cook.The only downside is the availability of cooking instructions and recipes. There are some sites with recipes but not a lot of guidance on electric pressure cookers. So it takes a willingness to experiment, but I haven't ruined anything yet, it's very forgiving.Two benefits are that it is quiet and does not produce heat. You can't even tell you are using a pressure cooker.I also plan to purchase the lid for slow cooking and recommend the same for others."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"While this does take up a bit of space, the creations are endless. We do find ourselves using the instant pot lid much more often, but this is nice to have and it is MUCH cleaner and easier to clean up than our deep fryer."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"I really like this pressure cooker. We did a pot roast with potatoes and vegetables and it was delicious. Meat was juicy, tender and full of flavor. I did lessen the cooking time for the roast as I knew from experience and personal preference we don't want the roast well done. I'm sure it'll be the same with other recipe's. Much easier  to use than I expected and I plan to make a lot more dinners in it. Clean up was easy and that was important to me. Really happy I have it. It's a real time saver too,Came with recipe book and web links to other recipe's. The controls were easy to set and I had no problem with the directions."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Ok, it’s been well over a year with my instant pot and I can now give my honest opinion. It has changed my life and cooking forever. I loved my instant pot duo so much I’m ordering the 8 quart for turkeys and bigger meals. I use it every day, have never had a problem with it and my food is to die for. I have never followed recipes, or even a cook book, I do my own thing, and my family loves my cooking. Tonight fall off the bone pork ribs, makes wonderful soups and stews, and anything you put in there tender !  I’m on the ketogenic diet, lost 125 pounds since this baby came to live with us and it has made cooking simple, fun and tasty."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I get the most use out of my Instant Pot Duo Mini than I do with my crock pot and my rice cooker. Instant Pot Duo offers versatility at the touch of a button. I can adjust the length cook time and depressurizing time to fit my specific recipe needs. I've used it as a crock pot (slow cooker), rice cooker, pressure cooker, and used it to make soups and stews My original purchase was the 3-quart mini, which serves me well most of the time; however, I recently purchased the larger Instant Pot Duo 6-QT Electric Pressure Cooker for my daughter because I find that I need to sometimes reduce the size of my recipe so that it fits in the Duo Mini. Love it!!!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,I love this thing. It has freed up prime real estate in my cabinets by allowing me to get rid of unnecessary appliances since this thing replaces so many of them.  I have just begun to use my instant pot and I know I have much more to learn (and many things I can use it for that I will learn along the way) you tube has a ton of helpful videos and suggestions too.  I love being able to throw a frozen chicken breast in to cook and have fabulous results quickly.  Or make bone broth in record time. Amazing invention!
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Wow! The Instant-Pot is absolutely wonderful! Easy to program, powerful, fast, and the food tastes delicious. This product is very well made. I do not have time to cook, and this pot has allowed me to have delicious meals in a short time without a great deal of effort. I can make a meal in 30-40 minutes with approximately 5 minutes of prep time! Remember that this is cooking with pressure, so always remember to release the pressure prior to opening the unit. There is a steel pop-up gauge on the back of the cover to let you know the unit is under pressure; it receeds back into the unit when the pressure has been released. The pressure can be manually released by flipping a toggle on the cover or letting the pressure naturally release itself (this will take longer). It's may be a good idea to tilt the cover away from your face in case of steam buildup. I have not regretted one moment of this purchase. If you do not have time to cook, this pot is your answer to great, quick meals!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,This works as advertised.  Not sure why I didn't buy one sooner.Update:  Guess What!!!  Instant Pot makes and Air Fryer Lid that fits this Pot.  What a great Idea.  Keep in mind if you might want an Air Fryer Later.  Sold right here on this site!!!
2.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought this 6 months ago and it blew up on me twice, spilling stuff on the walls and ceiling. Thank god it didn't heat enough to burne or my family in the kitchen.At first I tought I was just not locking it right or I wasnt cleaning the valve enough and it was getting obstructed. Nope. After the first occurrence I was extra vigilant about it and still.I love the convinience and reach to support in hopes I had a defective unit. Instead of offering a replacement, they are asking me a bunch of questions, making me take photos, run tests and video record it (really??).Not only I don't appreciate the lack of trust in that I have a (dangerous) problem, I don't appreciate them thinking I'm their QA team. I offered them to swnd back the unit so they can run all the tests they want. Nope, that's not an option"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"We just love this thing. So many good recipes and it's so easy to use! I do recommend buying a cookbook so you can more easily learn how to use it with a variety of recipes rather than frustrating trial and error. The cookbook authors have already done the hard part, so let them teach you how to use it! I am always on the lookout for more vegan instant pot cookbooks because I love using this so much. It will be nice in the summer when you don't have to heat the whole kitchen by turning on the oven or stove!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love this thing!! It's one of the best kitchen small appliances I've bought. It's the perfect size for two people and it's so easy to use! I was a little scared about the pressure cooking, but there's nothing to fear, just follow the instructions and be careful with the steam when you do a quick release. I learned quickly not to place it under a cabinet if I'm going to run the pressure cooker and do quick release! Best to place it out on a counter with nothing above it."

The instant Pot 7-in-1 pressure cooker has drastically reduced the amount of time I spend in the kitchen. When establishing my rating, I took into account the price point, overall durability, ease of use, and wide array of functions provided.Even at full price, this machine delivered everything it promised and then some. However, if their Cyber Monday sales are any reflection of profitable profit margins, it could be lower. For one day last November pricing of the 5-quart option dropped to $49; as a result, I picked up another one. As far as durability goes, the only issue I’ve encountered was due to user error.Take heed and be sure to refrain from holding the Instant Pot solely by its lid, as it has a tendency to become unfastened. The only other grievance I have is the tone and frequency of beeps emitted when cooking is done or beginning, but this may only be an issue for those with a tendency to cook at odd hours of the night.Of the many cooking settings, I have been most impressed by the yogurt maker, rice cooker and sauté function. Being able to sauté in the pot is a godsend, as it leaves all the tasty bits in the bottom not to be missed out on when other ingredients are added and set under pressure. Another example of versatility can be reflected by the slow-cooking application that is great for anyone who wants to draw out as much flavor as possible without using a separate appliance.With the ability to set it and forget it, you can be in class and cook your lunch at the same time. Chili? Great. Carnitas? Done. Feel like hosting a spontaneous Friendsgiving later in the day? That completely frozen turkey sitting in your deep-freeze can be done in under an hour.In summation, with so many innovative features the Instant Pot is a busybody’s match made in heaven."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I would give this a thousand stars plus one if I could. Its fast, convenient and replaces three other appliances for me: a rice cooker, crock pot and microwave.Obviously it is not as fast as a  microwave but if you are like me and replacing a microwave it offers an alternative to just heating up your leftovers on the stove and burning them or getting a steam burn from a double boiler.  I make a lot of dry beans and this is by far the best way to make sure that they come out tasty and done!Which ever model you choose you will not regret it."
5.0 out of 5 stars,I use to use my slow cooker a lot but now I can cook the same meals in under an hour what use to take me a whole day... and with the same results. Meat comes out tender and delicious every time. Even if I decided i wanted to slow cook something it has a setting for that! The steam/pressure release is a bit scary at first so use with caution. I highly recommend this to anyone and everyone
5.0 out of 5 stars,This has changed our world! I don’t even follow recipes I just use this and add some ingredients and is like magic it just turns into an amazing meal in such a short time! This has revolutionized our world of making everything from scratch at home!
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I use it at minimum once a week. It does takes time to get use to and adjust your recipes. As a working mom I do not have much time to spend in the kitchen but like to provide nutritional meals for my family.This cooker provides me with the shortcuts in time as well as saftey ( you have no idea how many times I burned rice before this device…).Samples of how long it would take you to make:- Rizotto – 25 min- Ribs- 50 min- Stew – 1 hr- Chilli – 1 hr- Mongolian beef- 15 min- Pulled pork – 1 hrI love, love, love that the inside is all stainless steel.I have been using this pot for 2 years almost and I highly recommend it to everyone."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"So glad I bought this Instant Pot. It is versatile, efficient, and effective. I can make porridge without babysitting the pot the entire time. I can put the ingredients in, set in on pressure cook for a few hours, go for a run, and come back to a  delightful pot of Pho. We've been using it consistently and could not ask for more. We bought our family another Instant Pot as a gift for Christmas."
3.0 out of 5 stars,"I've used my Instant Pot for two months. I get consistently good results cooking greens (collards & kale). Every meat recipe I've tried overcooks the meat, leaving it dry & tough! Also, the recipes are bland. You really need to crank up the seasonings to get tasty results. I recommend buying spare gaskets if you are going to try desserts because you can not get the odor out of the gasket after cooking a meat entree or a mess of greens."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I grew up with a mom who used a pressure cooker (the old fashioned kind) She got burned across her stomach one year HORRIBLY.  Swore, I'd never ""can"" anything in one of those evil machines. Then they invented this lil bugger. I use it daily!I can make fresh potato salad in 5 minutes from scratch.  Several varieties of pasta dinners in under 20 minutes. Cheesecake anyone? Yes, you can bake in this thing. Just get one then go to pressure luck cooking and follow instructions. TRUST ME :)"
5.0 out of 5 stars,Absolutely love this. It turns my instant pot into an air fryer! 2 in 1 makes your food so crispy.
4.0 out of 5 stars,"Been thinking about instant pot after reading about how great it is.  I finally bought one. I love all the features, especially the sauté feature. It heats up quickly. I found I needed to have all the ingredients ready before starting, Best of all, sautéing no longer splatter grease/oil all over my stove which requires clean ups. Wish the settings/functions are better, for example having a function of pressure cook and allow one to input time for the pressure cooking. The available functions are for the named food. Rice cooking is a problem for me. There is no water markers for the number of cups of rice. The first time I cooked rice with the rice function, I had to cook it three times. I’ll have to figure out how to successfully cook rice with it."
5.0 out of 5 stars,Insta Pot 3qt is probably the next best thing after sliced bread. For a family of 2 this is the perfect size and we use it extensively for cooking. Great as a combination of crock pot and a pressure cooker. We have retired our pressure cookers after we bought this. This fits our lifestyle perfectly. Leave lentils for cooking in the morning when we go to work and then come back to a prepared meal.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have used my instant pot to cook soups, stew, pork chops, pot roast, BBQ ribs, and fresh vegetables. It is really easy. I prefer the pressure cooking function to the slow cooker because it's so fast. It is also easy to clean. You can get recipes on line, but I like old fashioned cook books. I bought an instant cooking book on sale at Barnes and Noble, and have tried several recipes that were good. I like the pot so much, I've already bought one to give my daughter for Christmas."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"We have had this for about 2 years now and we LOVE it.  It has made cooking many dishes very easy and we have since disposed of our rice cooker, pressure cooker and crock pot.  Very easy to use and clean, and most dishes (especially chili) cook faster and turn out way better than cooking them the old fashioned way.  Even ribs turn out great using the Instant Pot, although we cheat and a little Liquid Smoke to give it that grilled taste.  I have recommended it to many friends and family members and if ours ever breaks, I will definitely order another."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've used pressure cookers, slow cookers since time began. This is my 2nd Instant Pot, first 8 Qt one I gave to brother's wife. I got a 6 Qt this time.  I've saved time and energy. You can cook anything in an IP.With it and my Air Fryer I'm set. If one breaks I'll be getting another."
5.0 out of 5 stars,This is the best way to cook vegetables! I love that I can sauté and make soup in same pot. Being a vegetarian I use the Instant Pot almost daily. Vegetables taste so much better than stove or microwave cooking. The high quality stainless steel pot cleans very easily. Very quiet and if I get busy I don't have to worry about staying near the stove like using a stove top pressure cooker with the automatic turn off and keep warm feature.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love this size, fits my husbands and my needs right on, have a larger pot also for when guests come or larger roasts or meats are cooked. This is much easier to handle and store and holds a lot for our meals. Perfect choice for us."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I heard of IP through a friend and found out there's a page in FB for recipes on IP. I followed that for a while and found out that every single one was happy about IP. Read amazon reviews and was amazed to see a4.7 star rating with over 12k reviews. So last Black Friday I bought one myself. I have to say i am very happy about the purchase. I have been using it everyday for rice, 1-2 times a week for lentils/beans/channa, once a week for meat/poultry and once every two weeks for yogurt. And all turned out really nice. The best part is I don't have to count the whistles as I had to with my other pressure cookers. It turns off by itself after the specified time. I love the delay cooking option too. We used to eat out on Sundays just because I didn't have time to cook after church. Now I keep my rice and lentils in IP before we go out, set the timer, and by the time we are back everything is cooked and kept warm. What more could I ask for. 4-5 friends bought this after I told them how good it is and they all agree now too"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm so happy I took the plunge on this pressure cooker. It does so many things that I've been able to get rid of a few other small appliances. I love that I can set it and walk away like I would with a slow cooker, but without having to be prepared 8+ hours in advance or worrying about things getting mushy. I did have to get used to adding the time required to get up to pressure into my overall cooking times, but it's no big deal to me since I can set everything and walk away. I'm still trying out new recipes, but have made restaurant quality mac and cheese, various soups, pasta, buffalo chicken drummies, great rice and a few other items. I saw this model offered for a great price on Prime Day and decided to order a second one to have for making a main dish and a side at the same time or for bulk cooking.My main reason for choosing the Instant Pot over other cookers was the stainless steel insert. I didn't want something with a non-stick coating that I had to be careful of scratching and then not being able to replace it if it got damaged. The Instant Pot has additional inserts available as well as other accessories, so the brand choice was an easy decision for me once I decided to get a pressure cooker."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I actually bought 2 of these—one for me and one for my parents. This truly is a wonder.  It replaces my crock pot, Dutch oven, pressure cooker, rice cooker.  It really is amazing. I have made paella, short ribs, stew, chili, baby back ribs, just to name a few.  The possibilities are endless.  If I can call an appliance a kitchen short cut.  This is hands down it.  This will make a home chef out of you!"
4.0 out of 5 stars,Received this product last week. After careful review of the other ones out there it was clear that this one had the best features. Wish to point out that the metal pot was the deciding factor.A first for me was the capacity to have beef shoulder roast come out falling apart when trying to take it out the Instant Pot.Having the capacity to cook rice without it coming out bad was very enjoyable experience.Just finished cooking 15 bean soup that came out for the very first time for me correctly cooked and even tasted quite good.Did not give it 5 star for two reasons.Cook book provided needs to be updated!There should be a clock on there. Did not get the blue tooth model due to the limitations identified by other reviewers.
5.0 out of 5 stars,Fun to use once you get over the fear factor!!
2.0 out of 5 stars,"We bought it in November and thought it was the answer to our rice cooker issue. After several months of using it, it's temperamental and the lid won't close after trying for 10 minutes. There is something with the sealing mechanism that is hindering its ability to close when plugged in. A cooking option was not chosen, it was simply plugged in. We're about 2 weeks past the return window so now we're stuck with a bulky kitchen item. Also, the coating at the rim of the lid is flaking off and I found pieces of that in my rice. One of the important features of this cooker was that the food would be free of plastics or coatings, however that was not the case. For the price, it should work flawlessly each time."
2.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought an IP during thanksgiving where the deal was too good. The price was 40-50$. I have another IP at my home that I bought an year ago for $110.There is a visible difference in the material used and control menu options. In fact, I gave the new IP as a gift to my parents.So, in fact the low price is not a good deal just inferior quality material used vs the $110 versions."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"There are many electric pressure cookers available, and I've used a few in the price range of the Instant Pot. But for ease of use, available pre-programs, and usable size - this Instant Pot 8 Quart Duo Plus has more than met my expectations.Ease of use, quality and taste of the foods that it produces, consistency of results, and the use of less energy than other methods of cooking (stovetop, crockpot, etc.) make an electric pressure cooker a ""must-have"" and this Instant Pot has been a great choice"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Is there anything an instapot cant do? I never used to cook, too much of a hassle. I bought an instapot and it is so easy to use, to clean, you can find great recipes I use it all the time. I love indian, asian, Caribbean, and south American food. There are so many recipes that make restaurant quality food, fast and easy at home. I cant say enough good things about this product. I've lost 15 pounds because I'd rather eat healthy, great food, then go to a restaurant. I love this product."
5.0 out of 5 stars,I love my instapot mini!  The size is perfect for one or two people.  I wad afraid it might be too small but it isore than adequate.  I make soup and chicken. Salmon filets come out perfect.  Next I want to try egg bites.  One of the best purchases I have ever made!
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I was extremely scared to use this thing because I was afraid of getting burned or my house exploding or something.My mother came over and showed my wife and I how to use it, and now we use it 2-3 times a week.I've made chili, pork roast, thai curry, rice, and other dishes, and I can't believe how quickly it works as well as how EASY it is to use.For rice I simply put in the rice, the water, and some seasoning, closed the thing up, and hit the ""Rice"" button. In about 15 minutes my rice was done, and my wife said it was the best rice she had ever had.Don't be intimidated, this is easy to use, and you won't blow up your house, I promise!"
4.0 out of 5 stars,"Love, Love, Love my Instant Pot!!  Such a breeze to use...if you've been intimidated by pressure cookers-fear not, this one is simple, quiet and easy peasy!After the third use I noticed multiple spots on the inside bottom of the pot that look as if the shiny finish has worn off or been eaten off somehow. The spots are darkish grey colored.  I  hand wash my pot...only, and haven't cooked with any acid, citrus or the like.It doesn't affect the use of my instant pot at the moment. However I am concerned that the whole inside of my pot is likely to lose its shiny finish, and depending on what metal is underneath, foods might react to the this now exposed metal."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"The pot seems to do what it is supposed to.  So far I have used it 5 times...4 of them as a brown rice cooker, which it does very well.  I was moved to buy it by a NY Times food writer'so gushing comments about it.  But until I just received ""The Essential Instant Pot Cookbook,"" I was hard put to figure out what to put in it.  My family & I all follow a high protein, low carb diet so I'm looking for good combinations of protein with vegetables or beans (the one dish it made well other than rice was split pea soup).  It's handy for quick rice and I will learn to use it for slow cooked meat.  It is basically an electric pressure cooker, very reliable but not a miracle."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Cannot live without my InstantPot!There is nothing like deciding at 1 PM to cook a pulled pork for dinner. In pre-Instant Pot days, the pork had to be prepped dor the crockpot at 8am if there was any hope of serving it for dinner.Instant Pot baked beans are cooked in under an hour (prep time for my recipe is approx 20 min before ingredients go into pot); I also make strews and pot roast, chicken (yummy butter chicken!), lamb shanks, osso bucco etc.And slow cooker function means I can simmer bone broth overnight.You can find lots of great recipes for the Instant Pot on YouTube or covert recipes from your favourite cook books."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I avoided pressure cookers for years, scarred by memories of one exploding in my mother's kitchen. But the safer, easier to use electric versions were tempting and some of my favorite food bloggers were featuring them regularly. After doing some research and talking to friends, I decided on the Instant Pot. It's quickly become my favorite kitchen appliance. My slow cookers and rice cooker have been retired to the garage. The IP makes perfect rice (jasmine, arborio, brown have all come out perfectly). Making a succulent pot roast in under an hour is a dream come true! I've successfully made rice pudding, coconut milk yogurt, kalua pig, chicken soup...all manner of recipes.I recommend buying an extra liner and silicon gasket when you purchase your IP - the gasket tends to retain odors and having one for savory, pungent dishes is a life saver. The extra liner comes in handy if, like me, you use your IP multiple times during the day."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love that it has only two main parts, the pot it cooks in, that can be taken out. and the lidIt does not burn you if you use it correctly, There are enough recipes in the book and on the websites.For me a not English perfect speaker, it is very hard to read the recipes, from the cookbook. My husband has made several and has no problems with it."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love my Instant Pot. I have been using it almost every day. From hard boiled eggs to Chocolate cake, I've made almost everything in between. My favorite thing to make is rice and Spaghetti. The instant pot infuses flavor into everything you make. Pho ga (vietnamese chicken soup) was a breeze to make. Normally it would take 4+ hours to get the same flavor intensity in only 1 1/2 hours in an Instant Pot. Granted I probably should have opted for the 8 qt but a 6 qt feeds a family of 4 just perfect. I only want an 8 qt when I'm making Pho so there will be another Instant Pot in my future!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,Love that I can cook dried beans without soaking in under an hour. Made the best corned beef ever. The saute is actually hot enough to get the job done and it is very versatile. A friend loves doing rice and boiled eggs in hers. This is a clever little pot.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I haven't used this as much as I thought I might - but, I haven't had it very long.  I do love the safety features.  It is easy to clean and I love the fact that food stays warm after it is cooked.  I plan to find more recipes and use it more than once a week!!"
3.0 out of 5 stars,"The first two times i used the item it was great. The third time, I decided to cook rice. The rice setting is automatic at 12 minutes low pressure. I had the seal valve set to seal. Suddenly when the pressure metal popup went up, steam poured out of the sealed setting valve like I was releasing the steam. I called the company, and didn't get a really good answer, but I'm assuming when you set it to seal, thats exactly what its suppose to do,maybe if a little wisp of steam came out that would be fine, but on mine it came out intensely, so obviously something is wrong with the unit. so Im replacing it with amazon. Amazon was great about it they are sending me another unit. I guess either the valve isn't sealing properly or i just got a defective unit."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love this instant pot.  It's big , and I thought I wanted the 3 Qt. but there are no recipes for that size.  I am happy with this one. It took me awhile to start using it, but when I did, I loved it.  It is very quiet unlike my stovetop pressure cooker, and I don't have to keep changing the temperature on my electric stove like the old fashioned one.  It's solid, love the stainless steel inner pot, and it works good."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have an older Cook's Essential's 6 qt pressure cooker but it doesn't have the features of and Instant Pot so I upgraded on Prime Day. Couldn't pass up the deal. I love to pressure cook especially tougher cuts of meat. You can't tenderize any better than by pressure cooking in my book. I did alot of research and the Instant Pot was the obvious choice with the SS insert and the features you get. Being a good southern girl, the first thing I cooked was pinto beans and let me tell you, I don't think they have ever tasted that good cooked the old fashioned way! They were firm and not mushy but cooked through and through! Can't wait to try a roast and cheescake now! You have to get one of these even at the regular price! I can see getting the 8 qt one for having lots of leftovers for sure. Anyway, my two cents."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is the smaller version (keep that in mind when looking at recipes, you can not fit the larger version quantity of items inside this one), which is great for just the two of us -- I've made plenty of items and works great! Whenever I've had to cook for several people, I can easily ""make the item twice"" bc each cooking time is more than half of what it would be the conventional way - so I can make ""two batches"" if I have to in half the time."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"This pot is well made and has many good features.  However, the written information that comes with it is not very complete; it left me guessing more than once.  I found that for general soups and stir fries my stovetop is still the easiest.  I recommend getting a good Instant Pot cookbook right away so you can learn how to manage the settings.  In my opinion the main benefit of this pot is the pressure cook aspect of it.  I have made several bags of various dried beans and can do stews faster."
3.0 out of 5 stars,"The smell remains in the cooker even after thorough washing of the lid. I use most for pressure cooking beans, lentils etc. Make sure to wash the pot to utmost clean level every time to avoid the burn message and interrupted cooking."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"Wasn't prepared to like this, but now part of the fan club.  Originally purchased this for my son's dual income family who eat healthfully but have limited time.  They already had one.  Kept it with the encouragement of a gourmet professional chef.  THERE IS A LEARNING CURVE AND NEEDS BETTER INSTRUCTIONS...their customer service is terrific for questions and/or need help.  It's my weekday go to.  On some items, it's faster/easier to cook the old fashion way.  Don't use to steam vegetables...takes too long.  Haven't used the slow cooker or yogurt maker yet. Don't place under overhead cabinet if using immediate steam release. Not another gadget and having fun learning this multi-purpose tool."
1.0 out of 5 stars,"Lots of buttons which must do the same thing. It has a rice button but heir recipe book tells one to use the pressure button.and a digital display, all mostly worthless. It comes with a cookbook and if you flip to the page on Rice's, they all say use the pressure button! And even though I follow their recipe exactly, it burnt my rice. It's low on function and high on looks."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I received this as a gift as I was looking for something that would be helpful in making healthy home made meals quickly after work. We were relying too much on processed foods, and I really like cooking but time is short in the evenings during the week. I had never used any kind of pressure cooker before. The old fashioned stove top pressure cookers always seemed kind of mysterious and tricky to use. So I was a little concerned about using a pressure cooker, but the Instant Pot is a totally different concept than the old fashioned stove top pressure cookers. It is as easy as using a crockpot, IMHO. The first thing I made was chili, with dried beans no less. And after a brief prepping session, 26 minute cook time and 10 minute natural release time, we had the most amazing, flavorful chili imaginable. And the Instant Pot is easy to clean as well. I am so glad my husband bought this on a whim. I can see us using this - a lot - to make all kinds of meals. I love it."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"It took me a while to join the Instant Pot Nation and Prime Day gave me the nudge I needed. Boy do I love this appliance!The instructions and recipes that came with it are adequate, but once I started watching YouTubers and Instagramers, I got inspired!  Literally, you can prepare everything from soup to nuts in this fantastic appliance!  And everything I’ve made has tasted fresh and fantastic!I absolutely love it and wish I would have bought it years ago!"
1.0 out of 5 stars,Received product today...much to my surprise no power cord came with it so I find myself having to order the cord that should have came with it.  Safety 1 - because it can't come on...Easy to clean -1 because it can't come on...Versatility -1 because you use it because it can't come on.  How do you leave out the power cord?????
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Oh yes.The Instant Pot.This is my second Instant Pot purchase. I first bought the cheaper, 6 in 1 model. Which is fine. I still use that one every day. But sometimes you need two! So when the 7 in 1 went on sale I had to nab it. I often have two going at the same time, but mostly I use the new one for sweet things like yogurt and cheesecake, and my original for savory (since the silicone ring can absorb odors, and some people say their yogurt will come out tasting like curry or whatever.)This is a great way to cook. If you haven't used an electric pressure cooker, you're in for a treat. Owning one has created a real renaissance in my kitchen, since suddenly it's fun to cook again. And nearly effortless, since most things I make are just toss and go meals."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my 1st pressure cooker.  I was actually looking for an electric slow cooker to make my dinners and keep the food warm without scorching the food.  This has exceeded my expectations.  I used the slow cooker function to make corned beef, baby potatoes & carrots, I was able to set the instant pot to turn on an hour after I left for work, it cooked on low for 10 hours and automatically ""keeps warm"" after the cooking time is complete.  I made cabbage on the side when I got home, I didn't want it to get too soggy.  The meal came out PERFECT.  I used the pressure cooker cooker yesterday, I put 2 large chicken breasts with 1 cup of chicken stock and cooked on normal pressure for 8 minutes, then quick released the steam.  Chicken was perfect, I shredded it. I kept the cooking liquid from the pot and increased to 3 1/2 cups of stock, added 3 cups of Jasmine rice.  this cooked for 4 minutes and released pressure after 10 minutes...I've never seen such fluffy rice.  I am am a happy customer."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Ok so I've had this for a little while now, heard good things from a friend and my slow cooker was on it's way out. I've used it a number of times but wasn't sure how I felt...yet. Has some cool pre-set functions, I've enjoyed the rice cooker function, made pretty good homemade broth in bulk, but takes a little figuring out on timings of things (depending on size of meats/ingredients being put in), and suggestions of people saying you can steam sweet potatoes in no time at all I found to be a waste (just microwave it if you're crunched for time DUDE!) ...but then this weekend I was having dinner with friends and was tasked with the meat course. I've been itching (no doctor visit needed) to try short ribs in this baby ..... LIFE CHANGING!!!! I've had short ribs and assorted braised meats at different restaurants and traveling chef pop-ups, and these ranked up there with the best of them. It was like my Instant Pot just became my new best friend, as if it's my new roommate. I love you, Insti. Just get one. Enjoy."
4.0 out of 5 stars,Overall I am happy with this cooker but I will add this is not necessarily easier or faster like ppl seem to claim.  It's another kitchen gadget and another thing to use.  As of now I still enjoy it.  I will most likely keep it to boil eggs mostly because it's easy as long as you don't forget and overcook them while your letting it natural release.  I have made several things so far and most turned out great but things tend to take a good bit longer because it's gotta heat up them cook then cool down.  Also to add with many recipes you still have to precook certain things and sometimes it seems like too much work.
5.0 out of 5 stars,I’m in LOVE with this instapot and I’ve only had it a few weeks. It’s easy to use. There’s an endless amount of recipes online you can find for the Instapot. I cooked 18 hard boiled eggs in 5 minutes using mine. Don’t know why it took me so long to buy one.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought the instant pot after a friend raved about it. I'm so glad I did. If I used it for only beans from dry and hard cooked eggs, it would be worth it. It saves so much time and effort for those two items. I also use it to cook Indian dishes like dal (lentils) that seemed out of reach before I had a pressure cooker. There is a bit of a learning curve and some intimidation, but if you order, unbox it sooner rather than later and start using it. It has completely supplanted my slow cooker. Easy clean up and versatility make this hard to beat.I bought this model because of the yogurt function, which I've used a few times but have yet to perfect. This size is perfect for a family of 2 that occasionally hosts dinner guests."
1.0 out of 5 stars,"Bought this mainly for white rice because our old rice cooker was going bad. It turns out that the pot is NOT non-stick and the rice starts to burn and stick to the metal after it's done cooking. Hard and burned white rice is not what you would expect from a product like this.We've tried slow cooking ribs and even that didn't come out right... we let it slow cook TWICE and it did NOT cook, we had to stick it in the oven to fully cook it after 2 rounds in this pot."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Growing up as a child I watched my mother use a pressure cook on the stove and was always scared to death to buy one because of fear it would explode when I opened.  Which by the way it did once when my mother was using hers when I was young.  Now 45 years later I have this one and can't believe how many meals I've made using it.  This is really a good pressure cooker.  In fact, I loved it so much I brought my mother one as a birthday gift."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Oh my goodness!!! Where do I start? I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS APPLIANCE!!!!! I am not a cook but I so desperately want to be. This electric pressure cooker will change your life. Not only is the pot amazing but there is SO MUCH information out there on the internet available on how to use, recipes, and Facebook communities. The 7-in-1 has a yogurt making option. And the Duo has multiple pressure cooking where as the Lux does not. I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this pot. I will admit that I was very intimidated by this machine when I first purchased it. But after a few uses I was able figure out the little nuances and was comfortable to following recipes for it.Here is one thing I've made in it that is worth it's weight in gold. I made a DOZEN hard cooked eggs in this pot and it only took 6 min. But the best part...it took less than THREE minutes to peel all dozen of those eggs! It was incredible! Perfect egg whites for deviled eggs EVERY TIME!!! So awesome!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have enjoyed using the Instant Pot for a short time now. Cooked vegetable beef soup, Spaghetti, and Country Steak. I am not sure how much time I really saved because the pot has to heat up before the timer begins, but the foods were very good. The ingredients blended together for delicious flavor."
3.0 out of 5 stars,"Wish I would’ve gotten a bigger one, especially since some of the included recipes are meant for bigger one! Can’t do a whole pork shoulder, can only do half of one. But does cook small dishes quickly. What you should know going in is the pressure cook time can be misleading, the total time is often significantly more once you factor in pre-heat time and “release time”, which could be anywhere from 5 minutes to 30 minutes extra! For example, quinoa cooks in 1 minute... but the preheat is prob 5-7 minutes and the “natural release” of pressure after takes 10 minutes. Still great for meats that typically slow cook for a long time, u now don’t need to start dinner in the morning—can do once u get home."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is the everything! I would not say it completely replaces or eradicates the need for other appliances, as there are certain times I just like the old way of doing things. However, this is an AMAZING product and saves so much time on a lot of dishes!2 words: frozen chicken!Yeah, you read that right. Forgot to take it out of the freezer yesterday (or 2 days ago) for dinner tonight? No problem!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,To be completely honest I purchased this for my pets. I was hit with some devastating news this year and was desperate to find a healthy alternative to making my furkids food. I make them bone broth now like nobody's business now (and one within 4-6 hours). I cook their meat meals without overcooking and loosing the nutrients as well as not cooking too high of a temp thus creating a carcinogenic to their systems. I have made chili for us and cooked a mall  turkey (juicy & super tender) in this for a quick mini Thanksgiving dinner as well as cooked some pork. Very please with this and can't wait to use it more for human meals ha ha ha
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love this pot and had many successes in it. Cheese Cake is to die for. Soups are fantastic. Hard Boiled eggs are fantastic. Potatoes for Mashed Potatoes are perfect. Mac and Cheese was very good. I need to play around with the cheese more. Chicken with Dumplings was very good but the dumplings are better when made on the stove. Chicken noodle soup was good but I need to play around with the noodles more. Now the disappointments: I did not like the ribs at all and chicken breasts are meh unless they are in a sauce. Meats taste boiled. Broiling after crisps them up a bit but doesn't dry them out. Overall though, this is a great kitchen tool and I recommend it as long as you know what exactly it is good for."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Smaller size lives on the counter and I use it frequently.  My husband is a vegetarian and I eat chicken so I’ve made lots of pulled chicken with my own salt limited barbecue sauce, along with chili and rice.  I’ve also done the cheesecake recipes but since the pot is easily accessible, I use it a lot!  There are lots of free recipes on the web plus some great user groups on Facebook for those of you who don’t want to buy cookbooks.  I bought mine through the Amazon Warehouse with a few scratches and dents but it works just fine and I have more than gotten my money’s worth out of the purchase."
5.0 out of 5 stars,I purchased this for my son who is on the Keto diet.  He was eating a lot of steak which got expensive.  I got this for him so he could get less expensive cuts of meat and cook them quickly when he gets home from work.  He is really having a good time with his pot and is texting me pictures of very healthy meals that he's making.  He loves being able to cook a roast or a chicken quickly and having leftovers for lunch the next day.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love this thing! It is so versatile, and so easy to clean. You can cook your entire meal all at once with the right accessories. You can make pretty much anything with this one kitchen accessory. When your done cooking and ready for phase cleanup. You pull the pan liner rinse it out. So far literally just rinse with the sprayer to get all food particles off, and even if you use accessories, it's still a much faster clean up than cooking with pots and pans. It makes everything so much easier, and it cooks things, including raw meat, super fast."
5.0 out of 5 stars,We love it and got very easy first roast beef chunk cheapest one because you do not need buy 10.00 special roast etc. It was so delicious indeed.we advise all instead of buying 7-1 XL as seen in TV his material is a junk. Instant Pot is only FDA approved healthy is my number one.You can feed a family of  6-8 easily. Use it make your own yougurt and save save money with a 1 month it pay itself. It will encourage you eat healthy and also be a Vegies in near future. This is best model easy to use . I am sure you know that man on TV keep saying buying on TV XL model . His is a junk because uses cheaper materials unapproved from FDA. So be happy we hope every family owns one of this indeed. I give 5+++ also some one asked me how much roast can you make it 5 pounds for sure plus your carrots and potatoes and others etc.. This model is the best of the best. If you buy it from Amazon you have always warranties plus excellent customer service from amazon. You can always buy the pan and other parts cheaper in amazon as well. Newer model is coming out from IP which you can control it by Ipad that is 400.00 dollars. I want to control it myself pay less lol.
2.0 out of 5 stars,"you cannot fit much in there to air fry.  I thought the rack would let you double the food, but it's just to get stuff closer to the heating element.  cooks ok, but you have to run so many batches, that you may as well just use the regular oven.  At nearly $90,  this is not a good value air fryer"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I was so hesitant to commit to buying this product because of the mixed reviews, but I'm so happy I did.it is simple to use; but has numerous wonderful programable settings, making it fun and unintimidating. The quality is great. It's solid and heavy in a good way. To cover makes beeping sounds when it's engaged and on engaged. The stainless steel inner pot is heavy and super solid. And best of all, it's ability to cook things thoroughly and quickly is superb. It comes with pretty good instructions that warn you not to overloaded with things that are going to clog the venting and ceiling mechanisms. And it's not a problem for me because I'm knocking to be using it to make lasagna or porridge and things like that. But I used it a number of times for vegetables and frozen pork chops and on frozen ribs and fish and all sorts of things like that. And it does everything perfectly. Hopefully I won't have any problems with the fuse or other technical issues because from all the reviews I hear that's where you start to have problems because the customer service is lacking. But my fingers are crossed. So far so good."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Wow. I have reviewed many items on Amazon, I can honestly say I have never wanted to give six stars before; this device is amazing. I use it just about everyday to cook meals such as clam chowder, carnitas, balsamic roast, refried beans, Spanish rice, and even yogurt. I even threw out my rice cooker and slow cooker cause this made all my favorite recipes so much better. And the fact it also has a satue feature that lets you brown meat or cook things like celery or onion is very convenient; less pans to clean! Though I have to say my favorite feature is the pressure cooker though, since I've never used one before. The fact I can go from dried pinto beans to refried within an hour is just magic!Last thing I want to mention is there are a ton of recipes online targeted just for this machine that are all very practical and affordable, bringing the versatility of this appliance through the roof. Other than my trusty futon, hands down the best purchase I've made while attending college thus far."
5.0 out of 5 stars,I love my InstaPot. Had to replace my old one after I accidentally melted part of the lid. This one has lots of features and it very versatile. The inner pot and the lid are dishwasher safe so it's easy to clean.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This pot is awesome! You can do so much with it. I browned pork chops in this and cooked them in a golden mushroom sauce and they turned out great. The meat was so tender and juicy. This is great for making chilli, dip, soups, rice, steaming vegetables. This can do it all. I think this is the perfect size for someone cooking for 1-3 people. Maybe even four. If you made a soup in this it could definitely feed four, its more of cooking larger pieces of meat is where you may have issues. It allows you to delay start times and has safety features built in. There are so many recipes available and this is great to use in the summer time when you don't want to be cooking over a hot stove or oven.  I love this thing!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have used a stove top pressure cooker for years. Someone suggested I try this out. I was surprised at how nicely it worked. I was used to the hissing noise the stove top ones made and was not sure if this was actually pressure cooking my food. It was amazing that it didn't make a noise while it was working and it was done in about the same time as the stove top one. I have used it for beef brisket, pork roast, pork chops, chicken broth, rice, beans, hard cooked eggs and to pressure cook pork ribs in 20 minutes. Don't be afraid of exploding pressure cookers any more. Pick this up for quick tasty meals in no time. You can also use it to make yogurt and as a slow cooker.I might have spent the additional money on the bluetooth one becasue you can also use it as a sous vied by programming to a lower temp."
1.0 out of 5 stars,Received IP marked 'defected'. Really!!? Shocked.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love my Instant Pot.  After watching several youtube videos on how this 7 in 1 multi-functional works, I decided to try it.  It was love at first bite...  I have made soup, chili and brown rice in it and they all came out fast and perfectly.  I have made cut up potatoes for potato salad and corn in the cob.  The thing about the instant pot is that it steams these vegetables in 7 or 8 minutes so they keep their nutrients and flavor.  A big difference over boiling them.I like the size of the pot as well.  It's just the right size - holding 5 ears of corn (6 if you cut one in half)I am so glad I bought this pot.  The pressure cooker is awesome and food stays warm without jeopardizing the integrity of the vegetables.  I started  potatoes for potato salad, went out and did a few errands, came back two hours later and they were cooked perfectly.  I would definitely recommend the Instant Pot to anyone ..."
1.0 out of 5 stars,it’s honestly a pain to cook in this and i’d rather just cook on the stove top. It takes just as long to let the steam out to cook the actual food and doesn’t cook all the way the first time. I got this at Christmas and have only used it twice and both times i wasn’t impressed. Waste of money.
1.0 out of 5 stars,Very disappointed in all the hype around this. It is not that great. I was excited for all these cool easy meals. Its instantly ruined if you cook anything with flavor. Total bust my old $10 stainless steel stew pot is more sanitary and multi functional.
2.0 out of 5 stars,"I have now cooked 7 or 8 meals in my new pressure pot with only one failure, and that was my fault for choosing not to follow the recipe.  I love how easy it is to use and clean up. I am definitely cooking more since I bought the Instant Pot, so I figure it will pay for itself very quickly.5/2017:  I loved my Instant Pot until it stopped working.  It was several months old, and I had used it about a dozen times.  The company was wonderful to deal with and replaced it.  After using the new one a few times, it was no longer cooking meat in the slow cooker setting.  I can't attest to whether it still worked as a pressure cooker.  After being out a bundle for beef stew meat twice (I'm a slow learner), I called Asurion, who immediately refunded me the purchase price through my warranty and emailed me a label to return the old one.  I just wish I hadn't given away my slow cooker and rice cooker when I bought this!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've been playing with this for only a few days. And I've found that its only come with the most bare minimum accessories. It comes with a metal trivet. But, the metal will be hot when it comes time to take food out, might think of getting a silicone one to help with vegies. Larger meats will work on the included one, smaller meats might fall through. Really, don't put meats on the bottom of the unit when cooking them."
3.0 out of 5 stars,"It's billed as easy to use, but I found it rather confusing.  The first time I used it--to make brown rice--the rice was uncooked, despite following the time requirements.  The next time I used it, again, to make brown rice, the rice was cooked better but still not thoroughly.  And the time it took was nearly the same as cooking rice on the stove.  Since the faster cooking time is supposedly one of the advantages, so far it has been disappointing. I would have returned it, but the time allowed had passed. I haven't used it yet to cook anything else, so I am hoping for better results with other recipes."
5.0 out of 5 stars,I love this! It’s so easy to use. I definitely recommend either reading the instructions or looking up a video on how to use it though. Some people mentioned theirs caught fire? I don’t know how that would happen unless you have both the instant pot and air frying lid plugged in at the same time- which it specifically tells you not to multiple times.
5.0 out of 5 stars,I have had a Cuisinart pressure cooker for years.  It was perfectly fine.  During my search for a gasket replacement this Instant Pot came up.  I liked what I read and decided I had the Cuisinart long enough to justify a new one.  Two features attracted me -- I always had trouble with the lid on my Cuisinart.  There was no warning that it wasn't properly closed so you didn't find out until you noticed too much steam escaping.  Then there was the inconvenience of what to do with this big hot lid when you opened it.The Instant Pot solved both.  It beeps when the lid is properly in place and the lid is secured in the handle slots.  Voila!! Have made only two meals  so far but both came out wonderful.The appliance capacity is the same but the footprint is sleeker.  All in All -  a wonderful design with wonderful performance.
5.0 out of 5 stars,My daughter has one and just loves it. being able to cook a nutritious meal both quickly and not having to stand by the stove watching the inter time is just amazing. i I told a friend how much my daughter liked hers and they bought one. They raved about it. SOOOOOOI finally caved and bought one. this is not your mothers old pressure cooker!I am not much of a cook but feel like a chef trying out new recipes with this instapot.so happy I finally just dove in and tried it.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I am in love with this thing and let me tell you why.  I found Pressure Luck.com.  The easiest most delicious and fast way to cook, ever!Every thing I have tried has been excellent.  When I first got it, I tried some tried and true slow cooker recipes, which IP does do.  But they took much longer than my old slow cooker using this method...so I don’t recommend it for slow cook recipes.But once I found Pressure Luck, I tossed my slow cooker recipes and I am delighted!  If you are on the fence about buying this product, check out the site and videos.  Then GO for it.  You will be glad you did :)"
3.0 out of 5 stars,"I keep getting a burn notice with anything that I cook. Nothing was burned either time. I was just cooking yams and then sweet potatoes. Did a bit of searching this message on the internet, and it seems this is a common problem with the newer Instant Pots. I am trying to replace mine. Hopefully they will accept the return. I have heard so many great things about the Instant Pot."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I am finding a lot of uses for this pot.  As suggested by others I purchased additional silicone rings so I could have one for savory cooking and another one for baking.  Made pulled pork; bean soup and Spicy Apple cake so far.  Everything was yummy.  I am having so much fun adapting recipes for use in the Instant Pot.  I got rid of my slow cooker, but kept my rice cooker."
5.0 out of 5 stars,Now I can get rid of the rice cooker and our crock pot as this Instant Pot Pressure cooker has many features to use.  I just need to get to using the hundreds of recipes in the Instant Pot free app.  But my wife and I are loving it! As a rice cooker this device will cook it in 12 minutes. At least to our satisfaction.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This purchase is a gift but I have one exactly like it and have loved using it from day one. So many different things available, much faster cooking times and a TON less cleanup - most of what I make means I clean a single pot, and the lid of course. Cleanup complete. Highly recommended to anyone who likes cooking, or maybe already uses a crock pot for a lot of their cooking - you can do the same with this, or cut the time dramatically and go the pressure cooker route. My fave is one-pot spaghetti - try it!! :-)"
1.0 out of 5 stars,"Everything sticks! I’ve got to throw out 2 x’s my organic brown rice because every time it’d stick. Also, whatever meat I’ve put in there it’ll also stick to the pan and make it all dry. After those times I’ve been so disappointed that it’s just sitting on my kitchen counter without use. There was one time that I made chicken stew and it didn’t stick. I guess I have to try other things but honestly I’m disappointed from all the times I used it that I do t even want to bother."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I’m assuming this was five stars, but to be honest I never got to use it. I bought for my girlfriend for Christmas 2019, and she didn’t get me a gift in return which was weird. Needless to say there was no thought on her part for me or my kids during Christmas and we broke up. This is in NO WAY a reflection of the insta-pot, which would never let you, nor your children down for their dietary and nutritional needs. Five stars!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Best kitchen appliance purchase I have EVERRRRR made, seriously, it has changed my life. I don't spend nearly as much time on dinner any longer, the pressure cook feature which we use most is awesome, I can have an entire roast with veggies and all done in less than an hour! I took it to a family function and showed off how quick it cooks a roast and they couldn't believe it. I love too you can use it as a skillet to brown etc before you close it up to cook, that is a time saver and a dish washing saver! I also really like the steam feature, it steams a whole head of cauliflower in less than 10 minutes, and artichokes in about 15-20 depending on the size. My only complaint is I wish it were larger, especially for making bone broth, I often run out of space for my bones, they stick up too far to be covered by the water."
3.0 out of 5 stars,"It’s fine, it works well enough.  The thing that would have gotten it a 5-star rating would have been a spiral bound cookbook of all the basics.  Instead you have to download a cookbook & it just takes something away from the entire experience of having it and/or WANTING to use it.When it comes to cooking appliances an old fashion print cookbook makes all the difference in how much you’ll like it."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"My wife and I were never slow cooker people so when everyone started about the one pot we were skeptical but decided to take the plunge and we are glad we did.  It is  harder to use than a slow cooker but the food comes out so much better.  Many advanced recipes require multiple steps and you have to read the book before using.  Regardless, it is a good choice and reduces cooking time when using fresh ingredients."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Omg..this item has changed my life!  What a help it is being able to make fast, good, healthy meals for my family!  We use it at least 3-4 times a week.  Everything we've tried has been a huge success!  You can find MANY recipes on Pinterest & in IP FB groups.  The 6 qt is good for the 3 of us.  Maybe ok for 4.  Any more family than that and you should go up to the 8 qt.  I may buy a 2nd one!  You can't go wrong with an IP and this brand is just fine.  I have friends with other brands too and they have also worked well.  The first time you will be scared to death, lol, but after that, you'll be a PRO!  Go ahead and jump in!

  
Instant Pot DUO Plus 6 Qt  9-in-1 Multi- Use Programmable Pressure Cooker, Slow Cooker, Rice Cooker, Yogurt Maker, Egg Cooker, Sauté, Steamer, Warmer, and Sterilizer"
5.0 out of 5 stars,I have a 3 in one Insta Pot and I LOVE it so much I got this 9 in one. And they are BOTH amazing. I will NEVER Stop using these. I can't be with out them. I HIGHLY recommend them. And it is NOT uncommon on a Saturday or Sunday night for me to USE both at the same time to have an amazing dinner on the table fast. Osso Bucco (my very favorite) is so fast and easy in the Insta Pot. And I love making BOEUF BOURGUIGNON in the Insta Pot. So fast and so easy. With the Insta Pot ANYONE can cook and cook WELL! I highly recommend both of these.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I was so excited when this was delivered I had to use it the first night! Did a trial run with some frozen fries I already had on hand - no prep so it was easy. Quick, easy and delicious! Have been frivolously looking up more recipes so I can put it to use. Next up: chicken wings where I will pressure cook then crisp with the fryer - and I’m so excited!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"What is not good to say about the instantpot?  I have a 3 qt and 7 qt that never gets put away, they are used that much!  7 qt size is perfect for 2 people and the 3 qt is great for side dishes, a few quick boiled eggs and such  I honestly enjoy cooking now because of my instantpots"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This Appliance has made a huge difference in my life and in my family's life and has allowed me to do all kinds of things that I didn't know I could do. Like cooking 5 lb of frozen chicken in 27 minutes. It has allowed me to  make things ahead of time and put them in the freezer to save time for dinner on other nights . It is awesome. It arrived quickly, in the packaging the way it should have been. And I have had no problems with it."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I 1st purchased one of these for myself. I loved it do much that I bought 2 more as gifts for my Daughter in laws.At 1st I was a little intimidated by it, but after making beef stew in about 30 minutes I was hooked. It is very easy to use. So, don't be intimidated by the steps in recipes. I have several friends that have now purchased them and they are hooked!I love mine! I was shocked at how extremely fast and how good the food turns out. Great when you work and want to cook a quick and good meal."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love, love, love my Instant Pot. The longer I have it, the better I like it. I’ve had several other pressure cookers, but they were manual models and are barely comparable to an Instant Pot because they have to be monitored and adjusted continually. An instant Pot compared to a manual pressure cooker is like comparing a Tesla to a Model T. Buy one, you won’t be disappointed!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"1st time using a pressure cooker,  cooked a chuck round roast in less than 1 hour or just about an hour. We cooked the vegetables in 10 min like the book said to but I think 5 to 6 mon would work fine they were a little but to cooked for our liking. It was an exciting experience and also a learning one as well. We used whole carrots and half celery sticks with red potatoes was amazing."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Have had this for several months now. I find it indispensable for making cooked cereals, split pea and black bean soup. Product works well and cleans up great. I find there are some things that come out quite well in this type of cooking. Others taste better cooked conventionally. Makes great brown rice which never came out good in rice cooker. Pressure cooking requires a learning curve.m mistakes will be made, but figuring out cooking times, water levels ,etc comes to one eventually I had a nice silicone steamer that really fits great. Easy to put an inner pot on top of for smaller portions.h helpful booklet included. Lots of good cooking videos on you tube"
1.0 out of 5 stars,I have been contemplating about getting an instant pot for quite some time. But when you spend 100$ on a product and it doesn't even provide you a basic spoon and ladle you kinda start questing the integrity of the manufacturer. I cant believe i now how to spend money getting a spoon and a ladle for my cooker. Disappointed
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I saw and read about the Instant Pot online for about two years before making my purchase. We own a very similar-looking rice cooker made by another brand that is made of much thinner materials and is more cheaply made. I didn't want to pay the much higher price for an Instant Pot, even with the pressure cooker feature, if it was that cheaply made. After reading a lot of reviews, and learning that it was on sale on Cyber Monday, I took a chance and ordered it. I am so glad I did! The inner pot is very heavy, and the entire unit seems well-built. I like that the unit handle has a ""cutout"" that the cover handle fits into and holds the cover upright (if you wish) when you remove it. I don't have to lay a hot, wet cover down somewhere when I remove it from the cooker. The Instant Pot is very easy to operate, just push a button and wait for the timer to beep! No mess of something boiling over on the stove. And the food cooked it it tastes really good. Cleanup is easy. I have not yet had anything ""stick"" to the inner pot. I typically use the Instant Pot at least twice per day and now do very little cooking on top of the stove.  I even made ""personal"" pizzas in the Instant Pot!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Thumbs up. The biggest convenience factor is that you don't have to babysit while cooking. So far only simple stuff like steel cut oatmeal, quinoa, steamimg, etc.  There are too many variant recipes on the internet, so confusing. The advertised pressure cook time is a lot shorter than conventional, however, the overall end-to-end time is a lot longer than the first impression. Glad I didn't get 6 Qt. But wish they have a steam basket fitting this mini size pot."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"My wife and I have been considering this unit for about 1 year. Bit by bit we have been adding components to our kitchen as we develop our skills. We bought this unit for ourselves for the Holidays, and have made a number of great meals with it so far! We had been making rice in our Zojirushi, which is great, but this Instant Pot does the same great job in about half the time. Jambalaya, Marsala Chicken (OMG! this was amazing!), and a few other dishes have all been winners, and have all taken less time than if we did not use a pressure cooker.I strongly recommend reading the included Instruction Guide, and I watched some videos online as well to make sure we use it right. Although they have built a number of safety protections into the unit, still, we are talking about high pressure, super hot steam, etc so using it safely and properly is important!Also, you have to work a little to find really recipes, but the blogosphere has a number of great ideas so no worries. Overall, we highly recommend this product!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've owned the 6 L Duo for about 18 mo and like it very much. However, I'm solo so always felt it was too big for most of my needs. I desired the Mini the moment I saw it and when it recently went on Gold Box Special, I bought one. As soon as it came, I did the water test and made some hard boiled eggs. That evening, I made my split pea soup using one smoked turkey wing and a half pound of split peas. Everything easily fit and turned out wonderful. I'll hold on to my big one for a while (just in case), but I think I will eventually pass it on to a nephew."
4.0 out of 5 stars,LOVE this instant pot but the base unit died after less than two years of moderate (3X/week).  I suspect the thermal unit burned out and although it seems like an easy fix it makes me nervous repairing a product that pressurizes.  Since it is outside of the warranty period Instant Pot's customer service offered to sell me the BASE ONLY for $60 (including shipping).  I'm still glad I purchased the instant pot but just wish it would have survived at least two years.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Quality product. Little bit of a learning curve to understand timing with regards to setting/starting pressure cooking feature. Once you learn the basics of the timing, it's easy to use and works well."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"After reading the other reviews on this pressure cooker, I decided to buy it.  It is truly an amazing machine and I can't even imagine how I lived without it before.  I've had stove top pressure cookers over the years and loved them, but when we upgraded our range to an induction range, my old pressure cooker would not work on it.  In looking for an electric pressure cooker, I found this one on Amazon and ordered it.  I got it in 2 days and free shipping with Amazon Prime.  It does it all.  Pressure cooks, slow cooks (much better than my crock pot), makes perfect rice and beautifully smooth and creamy yogurt.  I did buy the glass lid for slow cooking and sauteing and love it.  My next purchase will be the steaming basket.  I wish these two items were included, but, oh well.  I have raved about this machine to all my friends and family and plan to buy one for my grandson who will soon be graduating from college and loves to cook.  I would most definitely recommend this Instant Pot!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This pot is pretty darned amazing.  I made a pot roast with it this weekend.  The roast was pressure cooked in one hour; the veggies followed for 10 minutes and I had a delicious meal.  It seared the roast, cooked the onions and then it cooked the roast.  It is pretty amazing.  I plan to use it often; it saves time, does a great job and spares the number of dishwasher loads because it takes the place of a few other pots and pans.  I can't wait to try soup in it.  If you're on the fence like I was, I would give it a try."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"So far I am having very good experience with this pressure cooker.  I am not giving it a five star because I have some problems closing the lid after a few washes in the dishwasher.  Two other people who bought it at the same time also experienced the same problem.  Although, it still fits and just require some wiggling, I wonder if it will last.  Another thing, the recipe book is small. for a pressure cooker that's 9-in-1 function, the recipe booklet should have a lot more choices."

I was thinking, ""Whatever it is, it can't be as good as my old pressure cooker.""  hahahahahaha  Boy was I wrong!  As soon as I found out that it IS a pressure cooker, I bought one.  Talk about a game changer!!!  I was able to ditch my crock pot and my rice maker.  This model of IP has a slow cooker setting (although I probably won't ever use it).  It makes perfect rice, and without that odd, stuck together, brownish layer on the bottom."
5.0 out of 5 stars,I adore this product! I have only owned it for a few weeks but I have been using it 1-2 times a day. This makes the most gelatinous bone broth I have ever had (The kind where you turn your mason jar over and it stays in the jar so you have to spoon it into your pot :)). We also put veggies and eggs in it every night on slow cook so that breakfast is ready first thing in the morning. I am planning on trying to make our natto in this as well. I am saving up to buy another one! My only complaint is that the pot is not easy to clean after our egg and vegetable breakfast. I am able to get it clean with a slightly abrasive sponge though. I recommend this product to everyone! It is amazing!
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love my instapot! Honestly the most utilized wedding present we recieved! I am not a chef by any means and the instapot has saved my life and family's stomachs😂 great quick recipes are easily found in the instapot cookbooks as well as online. With the ease of functions easy clean up and fast cooking I am able to save money due to not eating out so often. Family members kept asking about the different features and commenting on it so yes I bought 3 of them to gift as christmas presents this year! I was able to gift presents for the holidays with a proud mind knowing it is a safe, nutritious, time saving present that everyone was VERY appreciative of!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This has been an incredible pressure and slow cooker combination. I use it very often for soups, stews, and other dishes. The stainless steel pot was one of the main reasons I purchased it, due to reviews that non-stick substances used in other manufacturer's pots flaked off quickly. The Instant Pot is incredibly easy to use and clean, and the sources for great pressure cooker recipes are many--including those offered with this device. The fact that it also serves as a very credible slow cooker is another reason to own and use it, and it moreover cooks all types of rice better than the dedicated rice cooker I owned before. The company did a great job--this is really an excellent and flexible product."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I am busy and it is hard to cook lasagna, roast, ribs, and a whole chicken. These cook so fast are very good. UTube is very very helpful. Also there are recipes online. The cookbook that comes with the instant pot has a great recipe for pot roast. Instant Pot Cookbook, 500 recipes Quick and Easy by Jennifer Smith is a must. I ordered instant pot bible cookbook, it looks promising to be very good. I love my instant pot."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"The Instant Pot IP-DUO60 7-in-1 Programmable Pressure Cooker is my new favorite kitchen utensil! There are so many options of how to use the Instant Pot and I'm loving getting to know all the features. Do you love boiled eggs? The Instant Pot steams eggs to perfection for the perfect easy peel shell. Deviled eggs aren't so evil anymore! Need an easy weeknight dinner? Toss in some frozen meat with your favorite sauce, set and forget. Before serving add some rice or quinoa and cook a few minutes longer and you've got yourself an awesome healthy meal! I love that you can sautee and reduce right in the cooker. No extra dishes!The possibilities are endless. I've done roasts, crock pot meals, eggs, steamed vegetables...the list goes on and on. I can't wait to try my hand at homemade yogurt soon! Definitely a must have in your kitchen. I even purchased a second for my brother who just moved out on his own."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I'd been hearing so much about the instant pot I decided to look at YouTube videos to get familar with it.  There are numerous ones, but I like the Pressure Luck guy in NYC.  So I bought the Instant Pot and have made recipe after recipe from cheese cake to beef stew.  It's remarkable.  So easy and quick.  I've even thrown in frozen chicken breasts with saffron rice packet because I really didn't have a plan for dinner and it was delicious.  My daughter bought one and doesn't use anything else.  She says the mac and cheese is out of this world.  So if you've been thinking about buying one...do it.  You won't be disappointed."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"We have only had ours a couple of weeks. This was my wife and I's christmas gift to each other.We have cooked perhaps 8 or 9 meals in it, and have yet to have a failure or a problem.I can see come summertime this is going to be a lifesaver. Real food without heating up the kitchen or whole house to do it.Comes with a good basic recipe book, and there are tons of recipes online and lots of video's to help.It is awesome."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This pot is not instant, but it is so versatile, that I've taken to calling it our 'Magic Pot'.  If you want a slow cooker, a pressure cooker, and nothing else, buy this!  If you also want to use the yogurt maker, or any of the other modes, this unit rocks in its versatility and it becomes an even better value.  The built-in timer alone makes it worth the extra $.  I purchased the glass lid for storage of stews and soups, for times when you will later want to reheat in the cooking pot.  Easy to clean, except for the lid.  You have to remove the silicone seal and one metal protective cover to clean.  I'd recommend buying a replacement seal, as with use, heat, age, and removal/installation, you will eventually tear or deform the original seal.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"
4.0 out of 5 stars,"We love this cooker. The only problem I have had is that when used for pressure cooking the warming function automatically kicks in after the time ends. It says you can let the pressure come down naturally with the warming function on, but based on some trial runs it would take hours for this to happen. Even if you turn it off, letting the pressure come down without opening the release valve can take 30 minutes or more. So save yourself the time, and just use the release valve.Also, to use the slow cooker functions you are going to want a glass lid which of course is sold separately. So do yourself a favor and just go ahead an buy it at the same time.Overall it's a great product."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I had owned 6 qt. insta pot for a while and was wondering if they would every make them in small size and they did. When they introduced 3 quart size, I was looking for a good price because did not want to pay $70- $80 for it. Being from India, we pressure cook a lot of things. My vegan daughter is constantly making her beans and lentils and she is scared of pressure cooker, so this is a blessing for her.  With new, smaller size, my kids use it to make oatmeal left and right, I cook small portions in it also.  My visiting in-laws loved it so much, they bought one for themselves also."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased this instant pot as a second larger pot for my family of 4.  I have a 6 qt which I use regularly.  There were a couple instances I wished I had a bit larger pot and for meal preparation.  I can see how 2 would be better when cooking veggies/starch that I don't want overcooked when cooking meat.  It does a fantastic job.  I am a busy mom of 2 who works full time.  This ""gadget"" has made such a difference in my life.  Makes meal preparation quick and easy.  Every kitchen needs an instant pot!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I finally caved and decided to try this whole instant pot craze. I’m still figuring it out because it has so many options and settings but so far everything I’ve cooked has been awesome. The only thing I wish I would’ve known is that, yes it cooks very quickly, but it takes a while for it to “come to pressure”. On average it takes 15-20 minutes before it starts the actual cooking but once you get the hang of it you can plan out your meals better."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought this as a gift for my sister. I’ve had my Instant Pot for more than years and she was so tired of me talking about how much I love it. There are so many types of recipes to make, it’s easy to take for pot lucks and never spills or tips in the trunk. There are a million great recipes out there, so easy and quick. It’s the busy moms best friend.And yes, a month later my sister loves it too and we swap recipes all the time."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"After 1 year of using this, I must say this is the best purchase I have ever had. It makes perfect rice, beef stew, chicken, etc. I use it like every single day."
2.0 out of 5 stars,"I think I hate this pot...it is okay for pressure cooking, but the slow cooker function is a total bust. The first time I used the pot it was operator error! Yes I admit I messed up, so gave it another shot and it was okay on the pressure cooking function. I wasted 8 hours on the slow cooker function, the meat was still cold. I said to myself, you need to go on the highest setting, and it said it should be done in 4-5 hours. After 4 hours on HIGH, meat was still cold and the liquid luke warm...I'm done with it."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Compre esta olla para una amiga porque yo ya tenía una y de verdad que es lo mejor que podemos tener. Nos encanta cocinar en ella, fácil de usar, ahorra tiempo y espacio. Definitivamente es una compra que vale la pena y un excelente regalo para familia y amigos."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"As expected.  Directions that come with it are not much help.  Recipe book is limited.  As others have said, the online information and recipes are available free.  I ended up buying the HIP and Pressure perfect recipe books, and frankly have not used them.  I did experiment with the cooker, doing what I wanted to do, cook vegetables.  I used the mashed potatoes recipe in the book that came with the cooker, and found I could cook corn on the cob, string beans and carrots to just the right level in about 2 minutes of pressure cooking (after the instant pot gets to pressure, two minutes more) and rapidly letting it depressurize.  The corn on the cob after 2 minutes, has enough moisture left, I can caramelize it on the grill, and it is not dry.  If I am not caramelizing, after the 2 minute cooking time, I let it stay in the keep warm phase under pressure for another 30 to 60 seconds, and then depressurize it rapidly (open the dial on top)."
5.0 out of 5 stars,I’ve contacted them twice with photos of the lid cracking around the top while cooking. They will not call or write. I have own the 6 quart and never had trouble in the two years we owned. I gave it to my son an purchased the 8 quart and haven’t owned it 3 mo when this happened. Warranty means nothing if they won’t respond.They did follow up and sent us a new lid. It’s working great!
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I use my Instant Pot for almost everything! So versatile that I use it several times a week. Recently made Mexican Rice, turned out great! Cook my ribs in it with bbq sauce, then freeze and grill later with more bbq sauce. Have made soups & stews. Love the saute feature, one pot cooking as after the saute is complete all of the bits are incorporated into the meal. So easy! Not everything is dishwasher safe so there is hand washing involved, but worth it for the ease of everything else. Would and have recommended to others."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have used pressure cookers for 40 years ... Cooking our everyday meals and garden canning....then we could not find gaskets for them,in our area and the ones we ordered online were so cheap made they would not even seal.....so I read reviews in mothers earth magazine on electric pressure cooker... And so I did several reviews on different models.... This model had stainless steel bowl which I wanted... It cooks rice,and yogurt to... Very good reviews leaned me to this model..I read how the Canadian guys wanted to make a good pressure cooker...I do not give reviews for anything,EVER.... but this pressure cooker, I have  to say is worth a review..... It's own cord so I can sit it anywhere I want.... Oh the best thing is you put food in ... Turn it on ... The timer kicks in ..cooks your food and turn off automatically ...I do not have to watch of over It.....oh and it keeps your food warm after cooking it... finally! a product worth the money..it makes my day a little easier......and if you've never pressure cooked you need to try the food... The meats are tender ....less time to cook... And the flavor is so much better.... . This was a good buy"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Oh man!  Can this thing make miracles!  Frozen chicken breast ( with BBQ rub) with whole potatoes and carrots on top (in basket) in 20 mins.  So tender! Only heat that there was in the kitchen was when I opened the pot.  I also let it sit on ""keeping warm"" for 10 mins to let the pressure die down.  When I opened the vent, only a little steam and pressure came out.  It made the carrots a little sweet.  We loved them!  Just put 1 cup of water...will use less next time in then added the chicken. I think that the frozen chicken put out  a lot of water.  Put a steam basket on top of that and added the veggies.  1st meal was soup.  Only filled about half full.  Potatoes looked like they were just cut, instead of falling apart like in the crockpot.  But oh so tender.Tomorrow....Goulash!  This will be great in the summer instead of heating the kitchen up and making the AC run forever.  You guys are going to love this!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I’m so glad we bought this!  I was kind of afraid to use “pressure cooker”, but there’s safety features so I like this.  I use this a lot to make soups and pot roast and they come out perfect!  I like that it keeps warm after cooking too.  I definitely recommend, and I would buy it for someone else as gift."
5.0 out of 5 stars,This is the 2nd one I purchased.  I first bought the 3qt and love it - but it wasn't quite big enough for my chicken & noodles dish.  But the 3qt was definitely a great size for the side dishes.  So I have now purchased the 6qt for main dishes and whole chickens etc.  I absolutely love the Instant Pot Duo - both the 3qt and the 6qt
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Had the 8 qt and found that I really would use a smaller one more.  When the 3 qt came out, I jumped on it.  I do use the 3 qt much more."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I’ve only used this as a pressure cooker so far, so the versatility is still to be tested but I can’t imagine what this little gem can’t do. It’s fun and safe to use. Easy to clean and more than big enough to feed a family of 6. The instructions it came with were very specific and easy to follow. I’ve made recipes from all sorts of sources and they all have instructions for times, temperatures, pressures, etc that are compatible with this pot and the meals turn out fabulous."
5.0 out of 5 stars,I was impressed with how easy this was to use. I did frozen French fries in about 20 minutes. They were crisp and delicious and no oil involved. Clean up was definitely easier. I would recommend this air fryer. It’s nice it turns your Instant Pot into another appliance without taking up a lot of room.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"How did we live without it? Wonderful, must have product. Every meal is just perfectly delicious.It’s worth it even just for making yogurt. Hopefully it will last.  The only thing is you should buy separate seals for different meals as they really absorb the aroma and stink."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"The first thing I tried when I received it was frozen french fries. They were delicious and crispy. The next thing I tried was jalapeno poppers made with raw chicken breast and OMG they were perfect! The basket is little but for 2 people it is OK. If I had a larger family to cook for, I would have to find something larger. Glad I purchased."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"So far would rate a five.  Have used it 6 times.For steel cut oats, rice, wild rice and quinoa, made up multigrain mix, fresh green mix (kale,swiss chard, beet greens and turnip greens) and then a vegetable mix of fresh and frozen vegetables.With the exception of the last excellent results.Appears well made.  Easy to use. Got it for a number of reasons. Easy to clean.  Can store all accessories in pot so they don't get lost.1. Not sure that cooking in a microwave is the best way to cook. Microwave cooking has been my primary method of cooking up to now.2. Hard to overcook.3. Hard to burn pot.Don't think it saves much time - as others have noted it takes a while to heat up before it starts the timed cooking.For cooking rice/grains I put in dish with appropriate water on top of steamer rack and the put a cup or two of water in pot.  This makes it easier to clean.Also some trial and error will be necessary to get the right cooking time and amounts of water."
5.0 out of 5 stars,There is nothing that makes dinner easier! Food comes out delicious with minimal prep. It does take a little getting used to the cook times (it can take a long time for the pressure to get to the right level before cooking starts).
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Few products are as good as this one. It's solidly built, easy to use, easy to clean, and works perfectly!My wife loves it. Every friend who sees it wants one.We have shipped several to Japan. (NOTE: It works on ONLY 100~120VAC and ONLY on 60 Hz. So it CAN be used in Northern Japan where the frequency is 60Hz but will definitely not work south of Kyoto where the frequency is only 50 Hz. This incompatibility is confirmed with the manufacturer...since the processor uses the 60Hz for timing things. While officially only for 120V it is being successfully used in Japan where the voltage is only 100V. DO NOT try this on 200~240Volt service or it may become a fire hazard.)"
4.0 out of 5 stars,"I remember my mother's stovetop pressure cooker and the way she would put a cooking fork under the weight to release the steam... This is quite different. First chicken breast was undercooked, but was easy to return to the pot for another 5 minutes. Learned to depend on meat thermometer. 2x frozen chicken breasts were perfect at 15 minutes cook / 10 minutes release. Have started collecting accessories... Wish there were more diabetic friendly recipies... and fewer ingredients, but I'll keep looking."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I ordered the DUO80 unit but I received the DUO80 V2 unit.  After a failed cooking experience and then a quick phone call to Instant Pot I fell in love with the unit.  ALL of the online directions, including Instant Pot's website, refer to the MANUAL button on up to 70% of the directions.  I was extremely frustrated because my unit didn't have a MANUAL button.  On the DUO80 V2, the ""MANUAL"" button is the same as the PRESSURE COOK button (bottom right corner).  Once that was figured out I was good to go."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Everyone should have an instant pot.  We love this thing so much we take it on vacation with us.  It can save you a ton of money  for family meals and lunches for the week.  I was buying red lentil soup from Wegmans at 5 bucks a cup  Now I make it in the instant pot in less than 20 min with dry lentils and could feed the office.  Rice comes out perfect every time (forget the rice cooker!)  Buy it, watch some youtube videos, you will love it!  I wish they made a smaller travel version for office/travel.  It also works as a slow cooker and can make yogurt (never have)Just note that some marketing comes into  play with the cooking times advertised but it does cook very fast, and doesn't heat up the whole kitchen"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"There is a new game in town!!  I ""test drove"" my new Instant Pot, last night, with a new recipe!  All I can say is ""Wow""!!!  The meal, Kung Po Chicken got 5 stars from my better half and 10 stars from me.  From start to clean-up, it was a great experience!!  Clean-up is a breeze.  Once you empty the pot, just fill with warm soapy water and clean with a non-scratch scrubber !!  Just like that you are done and NO lugging a heavy ceramic pot around to the sink or struggling to clean it!!  So glad I own this!!!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love my Instant Pot so when I saw they came out with a fryer, I wanted one. But I did not want another appliance to store. Then they came out with a fryer lid for the pot I already had.  I absolutely LOVE this lid! It is easy to use! It also crisps up food nicely. You need to use the stainless steel insert with it. It is worth the price and stores nicely! If you have an Instant Pot you will love this to go along with it!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I would have never dreamed something could make my life better. This is perfect. In a matter of days I have made stroganoff, muffins and baked chicken to perfection. Not to mention oatmeal and rice. All foods that keep very well. Once you get then hang of this you will be so happy. One thing to note is to also purchase Barkeepers helper. The bottom gets kind of not pretty looking very fast so I tried out my old standby and it looks like brand new again."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I had bought a cheaper one that never got used, it did not have a stainless steel pot!, gave it away after I bought the instant pot.  Best ever invention to prepare a quick, great tasting meal.  We eat a lot of stews and soups, as my wife and I both work it was hard to make a good dinner after work.  This takes 45 minutes (including prep time) to make a stew that tastes like it had simmered all day.  Use it almost every night."
5.0 out of 5 stars,Cook dry beans to tender in 40 minutes cook time. Afd time to come to pressure and cool down Beats hell out of soaking over night and cooking all day. I am impressed.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"I enjoy using this for so many different types of meal preparations. I only wish that the sealing ring would not absorb so much smell - I like you use a lot of herbs & spices when cooking meals. I highly recommend this product, but also recommend purchasing additional sealing rings if you want to use this for multiple types of food preparations. I have NOT tried to use a sealing ring with a smell and then try to cook something totally different to see if the smell is absorbed."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Having had this product for only a short time, I have not been real creative with it - made brown rice, quinoa, fixed frozen chicken breasts, pasta, etc. and am looking forward to trying yogurt.  They turned out great!  I had some initial trepidation but after making the rice and figuring out the easy to use ""buttons"" on it, it gets easier with each use.  Nice to get things made without having to watch the kettle or steam up the kitchen or heat up the kitchen with the oven."
1.0 out of 5 stars,I got a lemon of an Instant Pot. This is my second one and was never able to get up to pressure - the machine just kept spitting out hot water from the release valve. I tried all the troubleshooting that was recommended.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"it looks like it could be a little intimidating to use but it is really simple. once you use it a few times. I've cooked everything from soups, pasta to cheesecakes and they all come out great. there are tons of instructional videos and recipes on youtube."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is the probably the single more versatile, efficient, easy-to-clean, and speedy cooking instrument in my possession. So long as you read and understand the operation instructions, creating a delicious meal to feed yourself or a fairly large group is as simple as adding water and ingredients into the pot, sealing the lid, and a few button presses, and in no time you'll have the pressure cooker whip out some seriously savory good food. I made beef stew with this bad boy... the BEST I ever had. Don't wait, make this marvel of a machine a mainstay in your home today!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I absolutely love this thing! I was afraid it was going to be too small, but I cooked all month for myself and my two sons and there was always plenty... And one of them is a teenager! I can cook a 3 pound protein alongside plenty of vegetables. I love how I can use it to sear my meat and then just switch it to a slow cooker. This thing is such a Time Saver, and I love how it saves dishes! Also super versatile, last night I even made a cake in it. Can't say enough good about this product!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"So far, I have used the pot for lamb stews.  It is a great pressure cooker with a keep warm feature which I have not needed as I am there and ready to eat when the food has finished.  Easy to make beans using hard beans that have not been soaked and smoked turkey or smoked ham neck bones.  Times vary from an hour to an hour and a half depending on the recipe.I have made delicious home made chicken noodle soup a few times.  This would be great for chili, beans, soups and stews.  As far as the yogurt function, I have not had time to try it but I have made homemade yogurt on the counter before so this should save time and allow me to sterilize the milk.This is a great appliance that has allowed me to incorporate more vegetables into my diet.  Tonight we are having corned beef with cabbage and potatoes.  Get one if you do not have it yet, just make sure the size is good for you family.  I think the 6 qt can make food for 2-5 people and leave you with leftovers."
1.0 out of 5 stars,"So despite all the bad reviews, I decided to get an instant pot. I was so excited to finally be an adult and get to try out all the cool settings. Well, it finally arrived today, and when setting it up and doing the water test, all I did was put the lid on, and it made this AWFUL pop, and it started smoking and all the outlets in my house went out! I inquired about it and got my dad to take a look at it, something to do with the inner heating system, but it could have caught on fire! I was able to fix my outlets, but I wanted to see if it would at least turn on.. nope! It doesn't even flash an error sign. It is completely dead, and literally the first day, I just got it. I'm so sad!! I was really excited to use it for the holidays but I guess not :/ time to get a crockpot!"
2.0 out of 5 stars,"Very disappointed. So many rave reviews. The fourth time I used my instant pot it stopped working. No pressure, just steam. After numerous emails and photos sent to Instant pot customer service they will be replacing my defective instant pot. Also, the name instant pot is very misleading in my opinion. Although receipes will say that cooking time in the instant pot is only 30 minutes, they don't mention the time you must wait for the pot to heat up before it starts cooking and the time needed after cooking to release all the steam. A 30 minute receipe has taken me 2-3 hours! Scrupulous cleaning is also needed. This is a very high maintenance device."
1.0 out of 5 stars,Idk about y’all but man I love spending my money and receiving a damaged product. This product definitely looks like the employee didn’t give a damn or I got a lid someone returned. Super frustrating. Waste of my time and money!
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought the electric instant Pot a little over a month ago and have used it about 3 times a week. I've used the slow cooker function to have winter squash ready and warm to accompany a main dish, and to make soup. I have used saute and pressure cooker over and over again to cook roast beef cuts, whole chickens or chicken breasts, pork, and beef stew. Is it too dramatic to say it has changed my life by affording me the luxury of cooking in large quantity and eating healthy food all week? My husband agrees: This product has revolutionized our kitchen, just in time for winter. Store it some place easily accessible without anything else piled on top of it so you can easily reach and put back this wonderful machine. You'll be using it alot!  As for others complaints about malfunctioning, this hasn't been my experience."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought the 6 quart model Instant Pot because I already had an 8 quart model that I liked a lot, although for my cooking needs as a single person it was frequently too big and took too long to come up to pressure. Also, lots of recipes specify a 6 quart Instant Pot and because the price was right, I bought one. It is everything I wanted and I am quite happy with it. what more can I say?"

5.0 out of 5 stars,"This was my first Instant Pot and I am still learning all about it.  I can say that, as far as cooking ease goes, it's pretty easy.  For those of you who have used the old-fashioned types of pressure cookers in the past (me, included), this beats all.  If all you ever use it for is as a replacement for your pressure cooker, it is totally worth the money.  But you will find other things to do with it that will blow your mind and you will think, ""how did I never think of that before!"""
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Honestly I bought this because I do a lot of cooking and several people recommended it to me. So I ordered it and it sat in the box for 2 weeks before I opened it. I kept thinking, do I want another appliance in my kitchen?  But I decided to give it a try. I was a little intimidated with the release valve. Just watch a YouTube video on how to do it because the instruction booklet is vague. Once I got started using it, I LOVE IT!!! Everything I've cooked in it turns out wonderful. Meats are moist & tender, ""boiled"" eggs are perfect and peel without sticking. Don't know why I waited so long to get one. Clean up is easy. Use it several times a week since purchasing it. Recommend to anyone that wants the slow cooked meals in a faster time."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I doubt there's anything I could possibly say about the Instant Pot that hasn't already been said before. I have long loved kitchen gadgets that making cooking fresh healthy meals easier on me -- I have roaster ovens, multiple slow cookers, rice cookers... pretty much anything I can set & forget. The Instant Pot takes the cake. It can do what most of the aforementioned gadgets can do and then some. It's complicated to learn to use but worth the effort to do so. I am still finding new things that can be done with it and expect that will be the case for years to come. Worth every penny."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is a wonderful pressure cooker.  I bought one for my daughter and daughter-in-law for Christmas.  My son called a couple weeks later and said they just loved it.  Said they cooked roasts and several other things and just loved it.  My daughter-in-law got on Facebook and gave high praises on it and again thanked me.  I was with my daughter when she used her's for the first time and the soup was wonderful.  My husband liked the soup so much that he told me to order one for myself, which I did.  I have read on online recipe sites that this cooker is the preferred cooker with several chefs.  I can definitely understand why.  It has so many safety features and is so easy to use.  If you are considering the Instant Pot you won't be disappointed.  I even read in the manual this morning that you can slow cook in it.  So much for my slow cooker. :) There are several websites for pressure cooker recipes, you'll have plenty to choose from."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"The 6 quart model has worked for us for years and we added this 8 quart for bigger batch applications.  Our biggest use is making natural applesauce in the fall but we also love roast beef, boiled eggs that are very easy to peel, etc.We bought extra sealing rings for our 6 quart but are still using the original sealing ring even after years of use.  We bought the 6 quart because we liked the stainless steel pot and that choice has proven good in being durable and easy to clean."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Glad I finally broke down and got one of these (on sale, of course).You don't need all the bells and whistles that some of the more expensive models have, like the egg option. Almost all recipes out there seem to be using the manual pressure cooker mode, and you can find workarounds for everything. I've made sous vide duck breasts, eggs, soups, rice, baked potatoes...even cooked two small pumpkins, whole!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Do your research - so many different products out there.  I love this Instant Pot and love its limitless possibilities.  Do your research online, with friends, and certainly look for the articles online where they compare different brands and types.  This one is perfect for my needs, but it took me forever to do all the searching.  Enjoy your journey!!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This thing is amazing!  Granted it's technically just an electric pressure cooker, but the smarts in it allow you to be really creative with how you use it.  And the stainless steel bowl is fantastic.  Some of it's competitors use a non-stick bowl and they all have huge numbers of complaints about the coating flaking off and I don't doubt it.  You really need something tough to handle the intense heat and pressure this thing generates inside as well as be able to handle a scrub or trip through the dishwasher it when it's done.  I can't recommend this product enough."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I wasn't prepared to love this as much as I do.  I purchased it to hopefully replace a rice cooker and slow cooker.  While I haven't yet used it to specifically replace those utensils, I am surprised by the number of ways it can be used.  The saute function works much better than expected, though it gets very hot, so one needs to keep an eye on the contents and stir accordingly.  I made yogurt for the first time and it was delicious.  I look forward to finding new recipes to try each week.  I am not yet confident enough to come up with my own creations, but eventually, I will have enough practice to allow me to throw together ingredients without using a recipe."
5.0 out of 5 stars,I had wanted this for so long. Rewind to last Holidays.  I kept throwing hints at my son about this and how easy it would make my life. Well he struck out and bought me the entire Mission Impossible set (okay well come on I did giggle). Fast forward 2019 I am sitting at work and Click on an article.  I yelled from my office that today i will be purchasing this and will cook and watch Mission Impossible.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I got this to replace a rice steamer, pressure cooker and crock pot and it does a great job for me. I use this just about every day. The only thing I would like to see different would be a timer for delayed start that uses the time of day instead of a countdown timer. Much easier to use than my non-electric pressure cooker - truly just set it and forget it. You don't have to come in to constantly adjust the stove to get the pressure right (just don't forget to turn the valve to close it before you start). Rice, oatmeal, steamed vegetables come out great. It does take some experimentation to get a feel for how long it takes to cook your vegetables - 12 minutes steamed potatoes are just about perfect. I'm glad I finally decided to get the Instant Pot."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love this. It has made it easier to eat vegan. Beans are so easy to make in this with no salt. I also have made Jasmine rice, soup, and bread. I want to make yogurt next. There are many YouTube videos on how to cook almost anything. There is a IP app that helps you get started."
3.0 out of 5 stars,My rice tastes weird when I make it in here. Other than that it’s cool.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I don’t like crock pots to cook dinner because I’m so bad at planning meals that early in the day.I love that I can drop a roast in the instant pot and when I get back 3 hrs later it’s ready and amazing!  So pleased with my instant pot.If you aren’t sure how to make things there are many YouTube and Pinterest tutorials.JUMP ON BOARD, you’ll be obsessed!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Oh lordy, my life has been changed in an instant! I literally went from eating out every day to planning what I can make next in this pot. Love, love, love it. I could never make perfect rice before even with a rice cooker (pretty lame, I know), but I can now with the IP. Soups, pasta, oatmeal, asian and indian food, desserts...you name it. I like the 6 quart size because I enjoy having leftovers. I like the easy clean up. I really like having a good meal at home that’s ready in 30 minutes or less."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I wanted an air fryer but didn't really want another gadget in my kitchen. I was glad that Instant Pot had a lid and basket, which meant only needing to purchase accessories. Now that I have several air fryer cookbooks, I have been getting plenty use out of the lid. Haven't had any meat come out dry at any time while using it."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"This is the best! I grew up in Brazil cooking everything from scratch. This instant pot makes everything SO easy! It is a life-changer. I wish I had this a long time ago.  I also love how safe I feel when I use it. I was always afraid to use a pressure cooker, but this one is so easy to use. I literally cook with my instant pot every single day."
5.0 out of 5 stars,It really does live up to the rave reviews! I have used it every night since I received it and my only critique is that it over steamed asparagus twice even when I set it for 2 minutes only. If this is the worst that can happen I am sold! If you are not used to the steam release be warned- it sprays whatever sauce you have added into the air so be prepared to wipe down the cabinets above your working instant pot.
4.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought this to replace my crocpot. Well, it doesn't really work as a crocpot. I did research, most things said excess moisture was an issue when used as a slow cooker. It just doesn't work as a slow cooker. I used it on the highest setting for almost 6 hours and the food wasn't cooked not even close.I used it again as a pressure cooker and it was great. I guess it's a good pressure cooker, terrible slow cooker."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"I thought this little pot was very nicely designed. It doesn’t take a lot of space and does many different types of cooking. I tried the steaming function and was satisfied.However when I tried to make porridge it spills all over the place, with water level less than 1/2 full. See photo.Update -My bad. Instruction says porridge only works with slow pressure release setting."
3.0 out of 5 stars,"It worked fine for a few months, now it is leaking in the from=nt and giving me a ""burn"" message more often than I like. I was surprised it didn't really last a year before it started to have issues."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my second Instant Pot, I have the 6qt LUX and love it. This one is a bit smaller, and it has more features than my older LUX. I will use them both."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"It's everything I ever wanted. I had bought the larger one from Target before because it was cheaper than this. However, if was too big and I ended up gifting that to my mom and bought this one from Amazon. I absolutely love it. I won't waste your time saying why I love it because it's just fabulous for someone like me who gets home late and wants to make dinner. I throw everything in the pot, turn it on, go change and take the dog out, and before I know it my dinner is almost done.Shop around for prices, this was the best price at the time I was buying."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love the instant pot! This product significantly reduces the time I spend in the kitchen. It's nice knowing that if I havnt pre planned a meal somthing healthy can be put together in 30 min. Example came home for lunch put chicken stock and frozen chicken breasts in the instant pot, set it, took my dog for a quick walk, 22 min later I added baby carrots dried egg noodles set it for another 8 min and in about 30 min I had home made chicken noodle soup from frozen chicken that was pull apart tender. I have made yogurt, Creme burlee, spaghetti squash (9 min) , rice, hard boiled eggs 6min and so easy to peal, potatoes.... It's great and the pressure cooking makes the pan really easy to clean. I waited till it was on Black Friday super sale to buy, but now that I have used it the 130 price is worth it. Great value!!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Ignored my daughter’s urging to purchase for a couple of years and thankfully finally relented. Especially pleased with ability to make fresh soups from beef and chicken, to onion, black bean, mushroom, clam chowder, etc. Baby back ribs, beef and pork roasts, myriad of chicken recipes all eat and quick. Cleaning is a breeze. Greatest cooking implement ever. Saves time in comparison to oven and stove top as well as not heating the kitchen like an oven."
3.0 out of 5 stars,"I have used it for several weeks. It works in general. However, I have found that its control of cooking pressure is not very accurate. One of things I am doing everyday using my Mini Duo IP is cooking breakfast oatmeal with 50g Quaker Oats, 150ml water and 225ml 2% milk. It is cooked under low pressure for 4 minutes. Although the resulted oatmeal is ok, the pressure release valve is always raised for about 2 minutes during the process. This means that the cooking pressure reaches the max level (i.e. safety limit) of 15 psi which is way above the setting ""low pressure"" of 4-7 psi. Since the valve comes down after 2 minutes, it may be just a brief overshoot due to poor performance of pressure control mechanism."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've joined the cult.I love my IP! I can make my cabbage soup in less than 45 minutes (including building pressure , cooktime and release), bone broth for my dog in 2 hours ( and it gels!), and big chunks of pork butt in 45 minutes. And for the first time ever, I made rice that came out correctly! It was even a fancy mixed blend.I really didn't expect to find myself using this a much as I do. But between the convenience and speed and the very helpful IP community on Facebook, it's hard not to become a zealot! This is probably one of the best household purchases I've made in years. I just wish it had some sort of waffle making function 😜."
2.0 out of 5 stars,I have this a 2 because this is my second instantpot and the second one to have the seal go bad within 3 months of use. I actually love this thing but have purchased another brand due to the failing seals. I shouldn't have to replace a seal that soon. I also am not fond of the weak saute function that really doesn't saute. That has to be done in a pan and transferred if you really want brown meat.  So let's see what the next brand does.
1.0 out of 5 stars,"this was a gift to my friend in the UK. when she opened it recently at her party she informed me she can not use it because they run on a different system, When I placed this order didnt anyone take a moment to notice this or was it just sent blindly, 130.00 is a lot of money to waste on a gift that can not be used and no body at the time had the time to tell me there is and AMAZON UK , which I learned on my own. she can't use this and we need to send it back how do we do this"
5.0 out of 5 stars,It used to take me 4 hours just to boil pinto beans!  now its 10 minutes and slow release of 40 minutes and voila!  and I thought it almost died!  thats why I ordered this one!  I later found out my first one (gifted) really wasnt fried!  the safety feature kicked off my circuit breaker!  I forgot the liner was not in the core and had accidently poured water.  I waited 48 hours so it could dry out and I was back in business!  I gifted the one I bought here back to my father in law!
4.0 out of 5 stars,"We've had our InstaPot for a little over a year and used it 3-4 times a month. Last week it stopped working in the middle of a batch of chili. We took great care of the appliance, so I am at a loss as to why it stopped working. I sure am disappointed because we enjoyed the convenience of the product. Had this happened a few years down the road, I wouldn't have thought it so odd, but it has not even last two years of moderate (at best) use."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Bought this during Cyber Monday sales and cannot say enough about how much it speeds up cooking times. Love it and have used it to make soups, ribs, chicken, one pot meals, even using frozen meat. Tons of recipes online for almost anything you want to cook. Pot twill not open if pressure has not been reduced, so no worries about an accident. There are many other features we have not even tried yet. Easy to clean."
5.0 out of 5 stars,This is my new must-have.  It does everything they say-- meals that used to be a matter of hours are now a matter of minutes .  A roast that takes 45 minutes start-to-finish would need to be in a crock pot for hours.  Clean-up couldn't be easier.  The only negative is that as soon as I bought this I saw the new model that's available-- $20 less and has an attached lid that no doubt reduces fumbling around.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This pot does everything! I got rid of soooo many appliances that were cluttering my kitchen. Perfect size for a family of 4 and then some. Easy to read panel, very helpful instruction manual and recipe  book!! I was on the fence for a while because it looked overwhelming, but it was very easy to figure out all the different modes you can use it for.  Don’t be scared like I was, it’s a very handy appliance that I can now not live without!"
3.0 out of 5 stars,"I am sure this product works very well.  However, no instruction manual that gives step by step instructions on how to use it.  Does not include any recipes.  Bought it to fit my VIVA Instant Pot and it does.  It sort of explains how to use the air fryer.  Just don't know how to use the reheat, broil, bake features.  Have looked for utube videos, and manuals.  Nothing so far."
3.0 out of 5 stars,"It's a handy appliance, but I've had troubles learning to get the thing to seal during startups and the output isn't always tender and cooked as I would expect it to be. Advice from other users has helped to adjust times and recipes a little to correct some of the issues, but there's still a lot to be learned. It wasn't a magic pot that automatically did everything like the commercials would say it should."
2.0 out of 5 stars,"I didn't realize how heavy and bulky this unit is. I have a small kitchen, and the unit would not fit into any of my cupboards. When I tried to lift it, it was very heavy. I also did not like all of the prep time involved before the unit could be used. The description stated that cooking would be decreased by 70%.  Once out of the box, I realized the Hot Pot will not work for my and the type of cooking I do, and am giving it a 2 star rating."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great addition to the kitchen. I love that you can sautee in it, then use the pressure cook feature. Much more quiet than my previous pressure cooker, and indeed, easy to use and easy to clean with the provided instructions. Have made pea soup, risotto and chili so far. And cooked lots of soaked black beans. A great buy and I can highly recommend it."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I own other PC and thought that this was going to be just like the others but it is not. I am pleased that I made this purchase because it was a very good choice. This PC heats up so much quicker than any of the other electric ones, the inner pot should last longer and not flake off like the other non stick ones. I have used this gem just about everyday and everything I have made has turned out perfectly. Just remember to hit manual and then use the up and down option for timing. Most recipes and the instruction book didn't make this clear and I thought my PC was not working when I first tried it."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Best addition to our kitchen gadgets ever!  Seriously, if you hard-boil eggs in here, they will be the EASIEST PEELING EGGS EVER!  I am amazed!  (Just be sure to put the pointy-end of the egg up; otherwise the pressure could cause the egg to kind of explode!  LOL!)We've also cooked turkey breasts in here, and they are amazingly infused with flavor and are juicy!  We will continue to use this no less than once a week.  Great investment!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,This is my first instant pot. I got it from black friday deal. Needless to say its excellnt meeting my needs. I thought of initially buying pressure cooker and rice cooker. This one does both for me. There are so many other features
5.0 out of 5 stars,"We did a lot of research to find the best pressure cooker and came up wanting to try the instant pot. It has many different features including steamer, slow cooker, rice cooker and pressure cooker. Our first use was whole sweet potatoes. We put the steamer basket in with a cup of water and pressed the steam button. We chose 16 minutes and they were perfect! Next we did unsoaked dry kidney beans. We put them in with a few cups of water and pressed the beans button and cooked it for only 25 minutes. Again a perfectly cooked meal! We're really loving the short cooking time and low maintenance cooking (not having to hover over the pot and stir it and worry it will burn)."
5.0 out of 5 stars,My husband just loves to use this. He especially loves it on the nights I work late and the kids are home. It cooks frozen chicken much faster then an oven would and we just love that.
4.0 out of 5 stars,"Cooking is a true hobby of mine. I am constantly trying to discover new ways to make food more flavorful, while also reducing time in the kitchen after a hectic day at work. I have read much about pressure cookers, but have been terrified of owning one after hearing the horror stories of exploding soup in my grandmothers kitchen. At one point my father-in-law gave me their family pressure cooker after my mother-in-law passed, but I never used it for fear of cleaning pot roast from the ceiling.I then discovered electric pressure cookers. The reviews were solid, they were better than they were five years ago. Holding pressure better, more safety features, and foolproof handling. So I bought this one, and very glad I did.On the first day I pressure cooked an entire chicken, I figured why not go for broke. I lifted the skin, rubbed some oil, butter and rosemary on the breast. I then browned the chicken quickly in a skillet, making sure to brown all sides of the bird. I placed the bird and  1.5 cups of chicken stock in the pot with the bird. A few presses of buttons, and we were off to the races.30 minutes later a perfectly cooked bird, and I mean perfect. The entire bird was succulent and juicy. The pressure cooker infused the butter and rosemary into the meat; it was delectable, and better yet, done in 40 minutes when you add prep, browning and cooking. That is 30 minutes less than the oven.I have now cooked several other meats, vegetables and seafood in the Instant Pot, they have all come out fantastic. Corn on the cob was perfect, crunchy, juicy and sweet, in three minutes! Green beans, perfection.I would avoid cooking foods such as broccoli and asparagus in the pot. It works wonderfully, but it can leave a residual odor in the seal which is difficult to remove. Other than those, you will not be sorry when adding this to your kitchen arsenal. Get rid of the crock-pot, unless you enjoy dried out or overcooked meats, and get this pressure cooker, your taste buds will thank you."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This has lived on my kitchen counter since the day it arrived! I love this appliance. No loud hissing or steam release or rocking weight in the kitchen, just set it and forget it. I have used pressure cookers for over 40 yrs and I am thrilled to have this new technology.My Mr. said that was the best pot of beans he has every had! Finally I can fix something better than his mother does!I would like to have the beeper be louder as it is extremely soft.I did purchase an extra pot and the glass lid for slow cooker feature and am very pleased with both item."
3.0 out of 5 stars,"If you don't know how to use one of these, don't expect to learn from the instructions. They are horrible!  I would love to give it accurate ratings but still can't figure out how to cook with it."
1.0 out of 5 stars,This is the most disappointing thing I have bought in quite some time.  Doesn't work as described and takes longer than traditional frying.  I can't stress enough how much you will not like this product.  The IP is awesome but the fryer lid is a disaster.
3.0 out of 5 stars,"I cannot live without my instant pot!  Meals that took hours are done in minutes!  If I forget to take something out of the freezer for dinner, I don’t panic anymore, I just throw it in the instant pot!UPDATE:  On 01/30/2018 I submitted a trouble ticket to instant pot because of leaking steam.  I have yet to hear from them at all with the exception of an automated message that they were backed up with the holidays.  My previous 5 star rating is only diminished by the fact that Instant pot seems to have abandoned their customers.  When it does work, it works great.  But, sadly, I feel it's not going to work much longer."
3.0 out of 5 stars,Easy to use but the air fryer basket paint peeled off and stuck to some of the food I prepared. Pretty gross. I did follow the directions and sprayed the basket liberally but it didn’t help.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Finally decide decided to tip my toe in the instant pot trend! Only used it 3 times so far, but all three definitely a success. My crowning achievement so far is probabaly a pot roast which took just an hour start to finish. This is a 7-9 hour task when I use my crock pot! I’ve also used to hard boil eggs which were the easiest to peel of any egg I’ve ever cookies. I’m looking forward to figuring out how else I can use this. And have already tossed out my crockpot, rice cooker, and egg cooker clearing up clutter in my kitchen!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"The Instan Pot is fabulous, easy to use and i’ve Made several great meals that the family really enjoyed. Recipes are easy to adjust and very easy clean up. Have made delicious beef stew , a super good chicken soup (whole chicken) with veggies in about 40 min., Pork ribs, pot roasts , arroz con pollo, chili verde and can’t waite to use it again, will definitely buy another for my daughter!  LV luvmy instant pot!!!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,This is an awesome product. It's a must-have in every kitchen. I cook a lot of lentils and dried beans. It cooks them really well and faster than a stovetop method. It's very quiet and safe unlike a stovetop pressure cooker and easy to clean. I have  used the pot in pot method as well and I  am very happy with the results.Update: I had an issue with my instant pot and the customer service was excellent. I contacted the customer service via email and got an immediate response they gave me suggestions to resolve the issue and they are replacing my appliance. appreciate when companies take responsibility for their products.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"About a year ago I purchased the old fashion stove top like momma's pressure cooker, it blew up and I swore against them.  After viewing so many cooks on youtube always talking how great the ""electric"" pressure cookers are for creating very healthy foods fast, I broke down and bought this one.  I LOVE, love, love this appliance and plan on getting the 8 qt too.  It took several sessions before I gained confidence that it won't blow up on me, still a little nervous but I have retired my crock pots."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I threw out my crockpot--the Instant Pot is king.  I've used the sautee, pressure-cooker and yogurt-making functions, and each one is a wee miracle.  I was nervous about using the delayed start function overnight to make oatmeal for breakfast, but it worked out great.  I forgot to close the steam-valve and all of the water evaporated, but it turned itself off and displayed ""burnt"" on the control panel.  I was happy to see the safety features work, and the oatmeal was still excellent!  I made a beef bourgignon which my son said was the best thing I ever cooked.  Easy to clean, easy to operate."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"We avoided buying a mini pot due to the size - this is perfect for the two of us and works great! The instruction/recipe book that comes with it is not very good at all. Better to look at recipes on-line and read through the whole set of instructions as bit of a learning curve and when you print the recipe, most of the instructions do not print."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Talk about versatility, this conduction cooker will change your kitchen experience. Preparing a beef daube in 45 minutes rather than 3.5 hours in the oven is a life changer. But that’s just a pressure cooker, this can brown beef chunks, simmer liquids at exactly 195F for perfect reductions, steam vegetables and bake desserts in small ramekins. Cleaning is wonderful with the removable stainless steel pot and removable seal for lid. Will not regret this purchase..."
5.0 out of 5 stars,This pot brand is by far better than the others.  Works wonderfully and has a stainless steel pot so you don't have to worry about some non-stick coating wearing off into your food someday.  I will always recommend this one to anyone who asks about getting a pressure cooker.  We've had it for 2.5 years now and it's still working as well as the day we bought it!
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Hands down, my favorite kitchen appliance! If you don't like to plan meals ahead of time and just want to cook/eat what you're craving but don't have all day. You will LOVE this! I love cooking but sometimes certain foods I'm craving take too long to cook ie ribs, gumbo, stews. But with this.. I can cook anything I want really fast. I was skeptical about how fast it can cook at first.. but what used to take me 2-8 hours in a crock pot, dutch oven or slow cooked in the oven.. I can do in 35-45 mins with this! It tastes like you've been cooking all day! The saute function is AMAZING.. anything you needed to sear before you put in a crock pot before you can do with the saute function.. so you don't have to clean extra pots! The lid comes off so it's easy to cook in and it's easy to travel with. No more leaky crock pots! I've been using it for months now and use it all the time."
5.0 out of 5 stars,Couldn’t love this more. So great for baby food and so many foods for adults. We eat in a lot more often thanks to this. We now use our stove and oven so much less.
4.0 out of 5 stars,"I was never sure the pot wouldn't explode the first time I used it.  To close the top, you need a flashlight to see the markings you need to line up.  The sealing ring rack is I have no idea what.  It is talked about in the instructions but not pictured in the listing of parts.  Good luck with that!  The recommended test was undoable as how to set the time was not explained.  This is a trial and error piece of equipment for sure."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love. Been wanting one. Saw on black Friday, but was still not sold on another purchase. When I decided to buy, it was sold out. Found this on on Amazon cheaper price than I was going to pay for the 6 qt. This thing is huge. It takes up plenty of counter space, but well worth it. Normally,  cooking greens I would boil smoked meat for 35-45 minutes then and greens and cook an additional hour at least. With Instant pot I use saute option to render bacon along with onions and garlic, put 1-2 cups off water and pile greens in along with smoked meat. Using pressure setting and cook for 35 minutes.  The greens are fork tender!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"WOW!!!! I've had this about a year and its has been AMAZING!!! I cooked Thanksgiving mash potatoes,  veggies, turkey (a small one, of course) & experimented with bread (i think i had old yeast). I use this to hardboil a dozen eggs at a time for the week. Ive cooked mac & cheese, chili, chicken, rice...OMG LITERALY  EVERYTHING!!!!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,It definitely is a time saver. At first you need to learn the trick of closing the lid properly so the steam doesn’t come out. At the same time learn how to release the steam.Once you get a hang of it it’s super easy.Cleaning has been a bit tough cause sometimes the water goes around the edges and it’s hard to clean the main body.I would get the bigger one if you’re buying a new one cause i wish this one had the cake function.
1.0 out of 5 stars,"Single worst cooking product I’ve ever purchased. Quality is terrible. I’ve tried 6 different meals in it and none of them worked out! Every single time everything gets burned to the bottom. I followed all instructions to the letter and get the same burned results every time. Complete waste!The lid seems to leak pressure, even though it’s on properly. This can’t even cook rice without burning to the bottom.Controls are also extremely unintuitive. Save your self the headache and money. Don’t buy the hype of these things. A crock pot, stand alone pressure cooker, and a rice cooker, all bought separately will be cheaper and actually work."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I became very bored with slow cooker meals. I needed, because I work from home based office, a utensil that would make a meal, even if frozen, in a short amount of time that was palatable for everyone in my household, yet allowed me to continue servicing my customers from my home office. I searched and researched and kept coming back to the Instant Pot. I have since purchased 2 more and given them as gifts to family and yesterday, instructed my 85 year old mother - who is tired of cooking - HOW to use this and she is beyond happy. I have removed all the old slow cookers from my home as they aren't needed any longer. I cook meals every day in this and if you don't purchase one today, you are silly!! You will never return to a hot stove again! Order also some of the associated cookbooks and have a great time! It's healthy and I've even lost some weight because the food is so filling and flavored by steam infusion that we no longer want to eat at fancy restaurants with food filled with God knows what! Healthy and many recipes can be adapted once you learn the steps. Get yours today! YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought this for my husband (he's the cook) and he laughed because he still loved our crock pot from our wedding (in 1980) and said he didn't need this.  Well, after a couple of uses, he's a convert and loves it.  Clean up takes a little longer, but the flexibility in cooking methods make this worth every penny!  We still have our trusty crockpot, but this now sits on the counter and is used all the time!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I like to multitask while cooking so steaming vegetables was a challenge keeping enough water in the pan without burning up pans. This Instant Pot has been a lifesaver....or should I say a pan-saver? I steam potatoes (which eliminates the issue of acrylamide forming in the skins of baked potatoes) and they come out amazing! Corn, artichokes and even soups are a breeze with this, and when it's finished cooking, it automatically goes to a warm setting. I love it!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"At first I wasn't sure I would use this very much. But it spends more time on the drying rack than in the cupboard. Beans are easy, chili and spaghetti sauce are fast.  And boiled eggs are perfect *every* time. Because of the cost of milk in our area, it's cheaper to buy yogurt than to make it, but that wasn't hard either.It's easy to clean every part of it. Every part of the lid that you might ever need to wash comes off easily."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love this instant pot, the 8qt size is just fine and I only cook for two people. I dont mind leftovers though for the freezer. I broke the lid because I tried to put it on the ""holder"" on the side of the pot but the 8 qrt is big and heavy and it fell, just set the lid on the counter where it is safe, lol,  just a small piece of the plastic broke and was no big deal, its very durable. The whole machines size is intimidating, but the inside stainless bowl is like the size of a large crock pot. After a few YouTube tutorials on how to use the pot, I use it almost every day and just love it!!"
4.0 out of 5 stars,At first I wasn’t sure if I should get it because it would be another applicable but I’m so glad I got it. So far I’ve only used the sauté and pressure cook options. Sauté is great because you don’t need another plan which means less dishes. Pressure cooking cuts time dramatically. There are TONS of recipes online. The world is your oyster!
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Use this at least 5 days a week maybe more... go online to find recipes and go! Going to make yogurt this week. Raised bread using yogurt setting. Pressure cook pork butt or shoulder the most...inexpensive meat turns into tender goodness! Potatoes cook above the meat at the same time, Cook garbanzo beans (chick peas) to make hummus, use 2 cups right away and split remainder into two freezer bags with a couple T of cooking liquid. Cook pinto beans make refried beans. Rice, rice, rice, make up several cups of rice and put in fridge for the kids 18&22 to use. Make french onion soup with the liquid from the roas"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I’m loving this pressure cooker. I waited a long time to get one of these as I wasn’t sure if I’d really use it. And man have I used it! Great for cooking chicken breasts, pork shoulder, and beef roasts. I’ve baked potatoes in it and made stews. Lots of versatility, and many cooking sites online have recipes specific to these cookers now. Great idea to simplify making healthy meals!"
4.0 out of 5 stars,"Great little product. Quick cooking and fewer pots to clean.Love the idea of the stainless steel inner pot except that it does not clean as easily as claimed. Not by a long way.Also wish the additional inner pots were a bit cheaper. I don't want to cook savory, spicy dishes in the same pot as Yoghurt and oatmeal.Wish the recipe books had more recipes with fewer ingredients. I don't want to spend the cooking time I save on preparing all the ingredients."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"For a  bachelor this is the bees knees.  Prepare a dish the night before, put it in the fridge, then into the pot in the morning and dinner is ready at the end of the day.  These should have been invented 50 years ago.  Well, actually they were but without electronic controls.  How convenient is this model.  I gifted another two."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love my instant pot. I've been using it since 2 months and have made several dishes including soups, stews, curries, rice, chilli. The best part is you can sauté and cook in same pan. Unlike a pressure cooker, it doesn't have to be manually monitored. It's also pretty quick. The main vessel us dishwasher safe which makes it easier. Would highly recommend for anyone who wants tasty and yet fast recipes."
2.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought the Instant Pot as a gift for my mom, and we were very excited about it and bought several cookbooks.  We mostly enjoyed using it, although because the pressure takes a long time to build up and to release (if you are allowing it to release gradually) the actual cooking times ended up being much longer than we had anticipated.  We only ended up using it seven or eight times during the first year.  And then, two days before the 1-year anniversary of our purchase, it stopped working and flashed some kind of ""Pressure Sensor Malfunction"" code.  It was difficult for my mom to get someone at Instant Pot to discuss this, and then they ultimately told her it could not be fixed, and they could not help her, because she didn't report the problem until a few days later, by which time the 1-year warranty had expired. An appliance should not break down irreparably after just a few uses.  We are extremely disappointed.  Fortunately I'd purchased an extended warranty (which I almost never do.)  But hopefully that will save us from having an extremely expensive doorstop."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased this fearing that I'd redecorate my kitchen from the instant pot exploding upon its first use.  Thankfully I was mistaken.  I can't say too many devices have changed my life, but this one has.  You can literally throw dry beans (with liquid) and have them ready to eat in less than 30 minutes.  Same with rice and all sorts of meats, poultry, and fish.  I have a really hectic schedule, and it's great to be able to make a typically very time consuming meal in under 30 minutes.  There are tons of websites out there with instant pot / pressure cooker recipes too.  Also, if you have a slow cooker now, there's no need for it after you purchase this device - as this is basically a slow cooker on crack."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"The Instant Pot truly is the best thing I bought in 2017. Being able to saute, pressure cook, and slow cook all in the same pot is a game changer. I haven't used it for anything else, yet. It beats my old pressure cooker hands down because I don't have to wait for it to start rocking and then wait some more for it to depressurize. I just set the timer and walk away. Another huge advantage for me is being able to brown the meat first and/or saute the vegetables in the same pot which makes for a much richer flavor. Being able to saute is also an incredible improvement for slow cooking.My son lives across the country from me, but we share and compare Instant Pot recipes at least once a week. It has been so much fun learning to cook with the Instant Pot together."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love this little thing. Glad I got 2!. Have a spare should I burn one up from over use! One thing to keep in mind that most people forget about pressure cooker, it does take time to build up the pressure. Once it there, its a speedy cook indeed. One of the biggest grips I have about the 3quart version is 98% of the recipes are intended for the larger versions. Once I learned the conversions (didn't want to get the 100 quick easy recipes for the 3quart book) I was rolling. This is perfect for those that don't like leftovers and it cooks for 2 easily.Note: purchase extra lid ring seal (after a while, hard to get the smells out fully), get the non-stick cooking pot for when cooking rice, and get 2 of those along with another Stainless pot. You wont regret it."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"My 76 year old mom got this for her birthday.  It was easy enough for her to figure out how to use it by herself.  We have used it 3 times now and it is a great time saver and easy to clean.  Like seriously we took a frozen ham bone and dry beans and had soup in like 45 mins.  I was amazed, dry beans to soft and flavorful..amazing."
5.0 out of 5 stars,I have had experience with pressure cooking so i knew what i was getting.  I can tell after one week i will use this everyday.  Very easy and safe to use.  Made pot roast and congee both cooked very quick.  Much faster than in a normal pan.  Also i have foodie friends and know 3 professional chefs that love the instant pot.  I bought the 3 qt.  But i an single.  This would only be good for 1 our two people.  They do have a 6 and 9 qt. Model though.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"We have at least 3 slow cookers that we have used for years. Always hit or miss results. They are going to the thrift store. The little bit I have used the IP I can already tell it's going to be my go to cooker. So simple and quick. I have seen some reviews that complain of time to come to pressure and then time to release pressure. C'mon people! This isn't a microwave! It's still faster than heating the stove or oven and gives great tasting results. Everything I have cooked has come out moist, tender and juicy in a quarter of the cook time needed for conventional cooking. Highly recommend !"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I LOVE this air fryer lid! I was looking for an air fryer to reheat food, as I recently started a meal service. I am VERY picky when it comes to reheated meat. I use this to reheat all my meat on the reheat setting, and it works extremely well! The meat tastes just as good as when I made it! I am over the moon with my purchase!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"My mom and I both have health issues, so standing at the stove to cook and then having to clean up after was a pain. On the advice of my brother he recommended an Instant Pot (he had one and liked it). We went from ordering food 5 to 6 nights per week to once a week, if that. Great kitchen gadget and very helpful! Made it even better I got it on Black Friday, so paid half the original cost."
5.0 out of 5 stars,This thing is amazing! It works well and takes up so much less storage space than the old air fryer unit did! Couldn’t love it more!
1.0 out of 5 stars,Bought the Instant Pot mini in July; didn't use it until Sep b/c IPs are generally reliable (and I have the larger one).  Pulled out today to cook beef short ribs and discovered that the pressure value does not lock when sealed.  Steam emanates from the lid when in sealed position. Reading the other comments about horrible customer service does not bode well.  May cut my losses and donate - someone handier than me can probably fix.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my second Instant Pot. I got Duo instead of the Ultra. This one is much more user friendly but both work the same -- great. The easiest thing to make is yogurt. Only three ingredients - ultrapasturized milk, half a can of sweetened condensed milk and a yogurt starter. So easy. My favorite YouTube tutorials are Jeffrey at Pressure Luck and Flo Lum. Love my Instant Pot!!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,It is very versatile and good size because many recipes calls for this size. I use it to make meat. It is easy to clean but it is difficult to get rid of your recipe smell.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is the most amazing kitchen product I have ever purchased. Shipped quickly. Great packaging.I opened the Instant Pot and immediately went to the grocery store to try it out. I purchased a 16oz box of large elbow macaroni, a 16oz block of Velveeta cheese, and a pound of broccoli.When I got home I put the pasta and broccoli in the pot with 4c of water and 4Tbsp melted butter. I put on the lid, set high pressure with sealed position for five minutes. I opened the lid after releasing the pressure and added the block of cheese and a little splash of original almond milk. When I tasted this mac n cheese and really started to think that I just made 16oz of really good mac n cheese for under $10, this Instant Pot is well on its way for paying for itself in just grocery costs.I recommend this to anyone that would like to eat healthier. You can meal prep easily with the Instant Pot."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"As with everyone else, I love it.  I use it mostly to cook chicken from frozen.  Just plop a couple of frozen breasts in there, add about a cup of water, and cook on ""Poultry"" for 22 minutes.  Comes out easy to shred.  I am terrible with remembering to defrost meat, or I do and than am too lazy to cook it.  This is perfect for me.I got my mother one for Christmas last year and she said, ""I don't know if I'll ever use it. You should return it"".  I told her that she'd use it, and a couple of weeks later, she called to say that she was using it all the time and loves it."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I got this for an awesome price.  I already had the 6 qt lux, but the lux does not have the hole in the handles for the lid to prop in. It also doesn’t have the yogurt feature.  You can purchase a lux at Walmart and HEB for $59 but I got the duo plus for $54 on Amazon on prime day.  I wanted the yogurt feature to use for making bread.  Use it to make the dough rise.  I love the IP.  Wasn’t sure if I wanted the ultra because I wasn’t sure about the dial."
1.0 out of 5 stars,"Do you make a ton of dried beans or steam a lot of tamales? I LOVE it for that, but that is about it.Do you like really bland flavorless food that actually takes just as long in the pot as it would to do it right? Are you that person who doesn't season your chicken? Does your family like to be disappointed at dinner? Do you want to stimulate the spice market by using 3xs the amount of seasoning you normally would? Do you feel the need to join a cult and be part of the next fad? Did you have a lot of tickle me Elmo's and Furbys? Were you the beanie baby master? Well, this is the pot for you!!!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I cant begin to list the variety of things I've made in this. Have they all tasted good? No. Was it because I ran out of recipes and started experimenting? Yes. This thing is amazing and can do just about anything that you set your mind to. I made yogurt with it one day, a pork roast the next and chicken wings the day after.  Every foodie's kitchen should have an Instant Pot and lose the lame slowcooker!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my second instapot. I had a 6quart and wanted something smaller. Use it almost everyday. Bye bye stove topPressure cooker.I love the delay timer setting. I can soak beans inMorning when I leave for work , set timer and it’s cooked when I am home in evening!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"The next size instant pot is massive - this is a bit bigger than a rice cooker. You do have to adjust most recipes as they are for the larger pots but  you know, that's obvious. Fits a chicken if you shove it in or removes bits, a whole one won't fit. That's a bit of a downside but it works. Veggies, beans, fish, chicken have all been great and of course super fast."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is one ""Sweet"" kitchen tool.  From cooking brown rice in under 40 minutes (old rice cooker took 3 hours) to pot roasts, stew and about everything else we have cooked in it so far, we are very pleased with the results and with this purchase. The control ""panel"" may look complicated but if you take a few minutes to read the directions, it is actually very easy to use.  Very little ""hissing"" when being used the pressure cooker runs relatively unnoticed in the kitchen.  Our older more ""typical"" aluminum pressure cooker would sometimes seem to take quite awhile for the pressure to build and sela the pot before the cooking could really begin.  With this pressure cooker, the start up time seems to be substantially faster.I like the fact that you can set the pressure cooking time after which the unit changes to a keep warm mode unlike our old cooker which you had to babysit and manually shut off at the end of the cooking time.  Set it.. and forget it... love it."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This was my first venture into pressure cooking.  I was hesitant, but my very first meal in it was good.  Not fantastic, but good.  Since then, I've used the Instant Pot a total of 6 times, with mixed results.  Potatoes with meatloaf?  Delish.  Mac and cheese?  Not so much.  Perhaps it was the recipe I used.  Either way, I'm happy with the purchase because it has helped me feel a bit more comfortable in the kitchen.If you don't like ""dump and cook"" recipes, maybe this isn't the appliance for you.  However, if you need to throw something together quickly with not a lot of prep, the Instant Pot is a versatile, helpful thing to have in the kitchen.  You can throw meat in right from the freezer, and the recipes I've tried have taken about 45 minutes to cook, including time-to-pressure.I haven't tried it for weekly meal prep yet, but I suspect it's handy for that as well."
5.0 out of 5 stars,This Instant Pot has been great. I have the 6 qt already and having this 10 qt one now is great to save time and the ease of use and cleaning makes it perfect.
4.0 out of 5 stars,"The product was large and very convenient, and is very good for its price. However, the steam release is positioned weirdly and is too small for the 8 quartz and makes it difficult to properly release the pressure. MUST be very careful before releasing the pressure! I would think the 6 qtz is probably more than enough and is a better investment than the 8 qtz. But still happy with my purchase!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I’ve owned different cookers in the past, this by far surpasses everything I wanted. Replaces almost everything in my kitchen, including the stove! Now if it will just toast bread then it will replace all my kitchen appliances!"
3.0 out of 5 stars,There’s not a quick steam release. If you turn the release knob steam shoots everywhere and liquid  fills the overflow cup within seconds. If you want to release steam quickly you risk burning yourself every time it’s used.
5.0 out of 5 stars,Holy cow! I had no idea this device would change my wife's life. This was a Christmas gift which I thought would be used for a couple of weeks and then cast aside. Boy was I wrong. She has used this 4 to 5 times per week to make meals. Everything she has cooked in this has been incredibly good and made in a fraction of the time. Meets come out tender pasta comes out cooked rice is done to perfection seasoning is easy and efficient and we had great meals coming out of this. If this were to break I would buy one again tomorrow. We have a family of four in this size has done great for all the meals she is prepared
1.0 out of 5 stars,I used my Instant Pot 4 times before it stopped producing pressure. I looked up trouble shooting tips and did all 18 of them. Still no pressure. I ended up just throwing this away. I'll stick to the old fashioned pressure cookers from now on. Those have never failed me.
5.0 out of 5 stars,One if the best products I own. I make a batch of Yogurt weekly and steel cut oats once a week. If this was all I used  it for it would be well worth the money. I find myself using it almost daily for something.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This has been one of the BEST purchases we ever made. I use it daily, sometimes a few times a day. we did buy an extra insert so we can cook one item and start another almost immediately. I got another model as a gift and shared it with my mom and am teaching her how to use the different features. The only thing I would do differently is upgrade to the 8-qt. so I don't have to disassemble turkey breasts before cooking (the 6-qt only accommodates about 6# of whole turkey breast) I would also recommend the purchase of replacement rings so different ones can be used for spicy/strong smelling foods and others for sweets and vegetable dishes."
5.0 out of 5 stars,I love my crock pot. I can make anything with it. I gave the safety feature a 3 star because of the safety feature in releasing steam is not designed completely safe. If you bump into the crockpot while it’s in cocking the steam comes out. So you can’t move or bump it and definitely make sure you or any part of your body is not above the crockpot because if someone accidentally bump it and your arms are above the crockpot because for whatever reason you are reaching for something you can get burned from the steam accidentally releasing on its on. And it a bust if release of hot steam.
5.0 out of 5 stars,I like the fact that it does exactly as it is advertised . Have found it to be easy to use and made several stews even did a beef and noodle meal last time. At 76 yrs young I am pretty proud of my pot . Here is a pic of my bride of 58 yrs trying my cooking for a change
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Best Instant Pot ever!!!! My whole life has changed ever since I purchased this wonderful device.  I use my Instant Pot at least 3 times a week.  It's so easy to use.  Just set it and forget it.  I love it.  And yes you can buy an Instant Pot cookbook like I did but but just go to YouTube.com to find a massive list of free Instant Pot recipes to try.  Perfect Jasmine Rice - Perfect beef stew- so many great options.Word of Advice: Along with washing the internal pot after every use, be sure to wash the plastic ring in the lid and wipe down the lid after every use."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Pressure cookers scare me. I still have nightmares of stew on the ceiling. The Instant Pot is a life and game changer! I use it at least 3-4 times a week. I make soups, some pasta dishes, squash (no more sawing through raw squashes!), and savory dishes with still frozen meat!  Oh, and beans! I hate the sodium in canned beans, but could never plan in enough time to soak, cook, package, and freeze beans.The Instant Pot has made all the difference in the world for me. In the past three months I have made dishes I would never have tried before. Also, I love that I have more control over the sodium and sugar in my food. My whole family is eating more veggies too. I love everything about this appliance and can't wait to tackle the yogurt soon! Buy it. Use it. Don't be scared of it. :)"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love my instant pot! It makes preparing dinner so much faster. Puts my crockpot to shame. Initially there is a small learning curve, but once you get comfortable with it, you can cook anything I’m it in such a short amount of time! I recommend it to everyone!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"How did i wait so long to buy this? It replaced my pressure cooker, stock pot and crock pot."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I use this almost every day! LOVE that in the same pot I can saute then add ingrdients for a meal. Timer lets u know status, is SO EASY and easy to clean. Am eating much healthier food that is quick to cook and delicious. This is a must have for every kitchen"
1.0 out of 5 stars,Returned as there was a fault with the pot  had called customer service and there was nothing to be done but to send it back don’t plan to buy another one
4.0 out of 5 stars,"The instant pot is a cult classic for cooking for a reason, just be cautious using it.  The steam seal on top is very finicky and we have  had trouble getting it to fully seal.  Also, be cautious when letting the steam out as it will burn you if you are not careful.  An alternate review title might have been “Works as advertised, use with caution.”"
5.0 out of 5 stars,I am very happy with this.  The new safety feature is a plus.  Love making soups WITHOUT added salt!
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This wonderful appliance arrived yesterday. For dinner we made a ranch chicken and potatoes. From start to finish it took 25 minutes and that includes prep! The flavor was SO good and clean up was super easy. Right now we are making oatmeal in it. I can't believe I waited this long to get an instapot. You can't go wrong making this purchase!Now the recipe book that comes with it is ho-hum, but there are tons of awesome recipes on pinetrest."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love this thing - I use it at least 3x a week, if not more. I've also expanded and bought a second, larger one.If you're cooking for two, this is the perfect size - but if you're cooking for more, I'd go for the 6 qt."
5.0 out of 5 stars,This had the highest ratings & I know why. It does it all with very little fuss & not much to clean up. Stainless steel insert makes it so versatile & well worth the extra money. Has been super hot this summer & I can make lots of things that normally are winter comfort food without heating up the kitchen. Really do need a good cookbook to get the most practical benefit. There is a setting for everything. I turned a 7 lb. pork butt into a nice bowl of pulled pork in pretty short order. Cooks potatoes in no time & the list goes on. The overall size is a little big for a 6 qt. but I can live with that. I found the extra cover for our Kitchen aid stand mixer fits perfectly to keep it clean. If you  buy this you will not be disappointed.
1.0 out of 5 stars,Garbage.  Jack of all trades adequate at none. Their instructions are beyond useless into the realm of actively destroying your food by lieing about the capabilities and temperatures of the slow cooker.  It’s easier to use a soup pot to make pot roast.  Save yourself some money or get a traditional crock pot.
5.0 out of 5 stars,I have been thinking about an instapot for a long time and watching the prices.  Amazon had a holiday deal that made me finally purchase. I’m on a keto way of eating and have to say I couldn’t be more thrilled with this purchase. I did damage the lid on my hot stove but the nuts and bolts of this is that it is so well made that my accidental melt down if part of the handle did not impact this working. I have used it almost every day and will be donating or selling a few kitchen gadgets this replaces.  Purchased another two as Christmas gifts!
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This gadget has been in constant use in my kitchen since purchasing a few months ago.  We are a family with busy teenagers and were spending too much of our budget on quick meals out when things got hectic.  Now I can have a meal from fridge (or freezer) to table in well under an hour with the quality of all-day cooking.  We are eating healthier, cheaper and deliciously.I am so glad I chose the 7-in-1 that includes the yogurt function.  When I purchased this, I never thought I would make homemade yogurt, but a friend convinced me it was her favorite thing to do with her Instant Pot so I upgraded. I make yogurt all the time now and will never go back to store-bought."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I thought all the rave reviews were just some hype over the latest craze. It's no hype. This machine is great. So far I've used it just about every night since it's arrival a week ago. I have made a 'to die for' cheesecake, chicken soup that makes my family ask for it as leftovers (that's high praise - they don't like soup) fall of the bone tender whole chicken, chicken breasts from frozen that is more  tender, moist than if I thawed it and cooked in my pampered chef crock roaster. I've cooked beans, rice, millet and quinoa that are perfect every time. This small appliance will pay for itself in the savings from not needing to get fast food. Still takes some planning but the results make me want to plan. Amazing, go for it!  You won't regret the purchase. You'll only wish you bought it sooner. I can hardly wait to try all the other recipes I've found."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Pressure cooking aspect is amazing.  It keeps the heat perfect so that the pressure is the pressure isn't venting continuously.  Love that we can make rice for a crowd in it. We gave away our big rice cooker years ago, so we to have this as one of its settings. Makes amazing carnitas out of pork shoulder.  Follow the recipes that come in the booklet.  Don't ""wing it"" until you fully understand how this pot cooks."
4.0 out of 5 stars,Having dental work done and needed a way to cook food that is tender enough to eat during this time.  My son in the AirForce kept praising his Instapot and posting delicious recipes so I decided to give it a try....a great product and a good price.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I now have a sweet little Workhorse on my counter. I love my new instant pot. I've always prided myself on being a decent cook. This instant pot allows me to not have to be in the kitchen all day but still have excellent, delicious, & memorable meals!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I was very happy to find this lid for my instant pot. I had been wanting an air fryer but didn't want ""another"" appliance on my counter. This works just like it should and is great for what I need. I only cook for two so its size is perfect.  Everything I have made has come out better then the oven."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I am a terrible cook. I can admit that I have caused kitchen fires by just putting ingredients on the counter. So I was a bit hesitant to buy a crockpot/pressure cooker. But I must say that my life was changed for the better and I refuse to go back! This pot has changed my life (surprisingly not the first time I have said these words). Finally I am no longer the shame of my family with my inability to make even the most basics of dishes. I made rice for my family with it, and I could see tears of joy falling from my father's eyes. Sadly I have not ventured beyond rice at the moment, but I did buy my mom one as well. Now I know that this little product makes the most succulent pork. After a few hours cooking, the meat practically fell from the bones. I love it so much, I've decided to buy one for my brother as well.Due to my busy schedule, I find this product perfect. Once I become brave enough to add meats into the mix, I can come home to delicious food waiting. Who says you need a spouse to be welcomed by food in this day and age. I suggest you toss your partner and get one of these instead. They're much cheaper and never yell at you for getting the wrong type of onions.Honestly since buying this product I feel like the classiest person to grace the streets. Strongly recommend!!!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"So,  gave it a go straight away with a random online recipe.  It was good, but it needed a bit more time.  Word to the wise, make sure you allow extra time if you’ve got thicker cuts of meat than the recipe.  (Store was out of chops, so I just cut up a pork loin...). Still it was fast, easy, and easy to clean."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought this smaller instant pot to compliment my 8qt instant pot and it’s perfect.With just the 8qt instant pot it was simply too inconvenient to finish one cook, clean and start another.I use the smaller instant pot for sides like rice and vegetables so I can have everything done at once.Then I can just throw all the inserts in the dishwasher if needed."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is a great rice cooker! We bought this Instant Pot to replace our three years old Zojirushi NS-WXC10. We could not be more happier. This was kind of a big surprise. We always assumed our Zojirushi should be better than any ordinary rice cookers because it would take 50~60 minutes to cook one pot of rice. It got to be good, right? Not so. This Instant Pot actually can cook much better tasty rice within 15 min. We now do not have to struggle with planning ahead for our rice meal each time. Rice can be ""Instant"" ready. In addition, Instant Pot has a high quality stainless steel inner pot while Zojirushi's non-stick pot already showed sign of scratches even with careful use. We expect our new Instant Pot would serve us many years of tasty rice."
2.0 out of 5 stars,"They say this is a pressure cooker AND slow cooker.  It failed at the slow cooker part.  I had butternut squash on high for at least 11 hours and it still wasn't cooked.  As for the pressure cooker mode, I kept getting the BURN notification  when cooking a roast with carrots and mushrooms.  I had plenty of liquid in there so I don't understand why it happened.  The chili turned out well but I think it turns out better when you slow cook it.  The sauce is nice and think vs. being watery."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I actually bought this pressure cooker because I got tired of throwing away the inexpensive rice cookers I've used for decades when the non-stick coating began to peel off.  I decided to look for something with a stainless steel inner pot, and a few review sites pointed me in the direction of the Instant Pot.Since it arrived at my doorstep a few months ago, I've been using it at least four times a week for everything from rice to soups, stews, steamed veggies, beans, chicken, and fish.Did I mention it makes rice perfectly?  Gone are the days of the crusty layer of rice at the bottom of ""bargain"" rice cookers!I really have no idea why I waited so long to buy one.  I like it so much I talked two other people into buying the same model, and they love it as well!"
4.0 out of 5 stars,"My first recipe from this pot was a beef stew, and it was amazing. I was a bit intimidated by the controls at first but honestly most of the buttons are like the extra buttons on the microwave. So long as you respect the very important safety guidelines, you can operate this thing and make wonderful food quickly. The only drawback I saw is that you need to buy more of those silicone rings that go into the lid because they retain the odor of your last dish pretty well, even after repeated washings."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have the IP 3qt LUX. I use it all the time, and I really needed a second one. Decided to get the IP DUO 6QT, because was on sale via Amazon for $69.00, and mostly all recipes are for 6 QUARTS and none for 3 Quarts.I actually like the 6 qt better, because it heats up faster. ESP for Saute! I was never ever successful in searing in my 3 qt IP. However the 6QT one is much better because has more heat and power!I LOVE IT---VERY MUCH!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love it. Granted, I'm not a zealot (some people in the Instant Pot facebook group will ONLY cook in their IP) but for me, who rents a house with a very old stove and oven (neither of which work well) it has been a life saver. You can make anything from cheesecake to yogurt to bean soup to dog food to baby food. Forget to defrost your meat? No problem. Any slow cooker recipe is easily adapted. It's not for everyone, but if you eat a lot of yogurt and do a lot of crockpot cooking, it's great. Plus, it doesn't heat your kitchen up like an oven or a stove will. A word of advice: read the entire owner's manual before use, and be patient! It takes a few sessions before you'll be really comfortable with it. Also, as a side note-- super lean cuts of poultry tend to dry out. Just my opinion."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This product replaces an earlier generation competitive product (Power XL). We prefer the stainless steel cooking pot over the thinner, non-stick pot in the other product. Saves a ton of time (and energy) for making soups, oatmeal or beans. Haven't tested all its capabilities yet."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love this pot.  I hate cooking and this gives me incentive.  I've used it 3x:  ground beef ragu, chicken tortilla soup, and chicken veggie soup. All turned out excellently.  My husband, the doubter, gave all 3 recipes a major thumbs up.  Oh, make that 4x since I also cooked a large pot of brown rice and it was great.  It is like using a crock pot but you don't have to figure out and put the meal together in the morning.  You can come home from work and throw a meal together and be eating in an hour.  I've done it in much less than an hour with the ragu.  For me there was a learning curve but very soon you get the idea of it.  If I can figure it out, anyone can.  Me and kitchen items don't generally mesh.  Did I mention I hate cooking.  This pot makes it bearable for me."
1.0 out of 5 stars,"Constant ""food burn"" messages have rendered my pot unusable for the last 10 or so meals despite constant and detailed cleaning and prep. Pot rarely gets up to pressure and sometimes I have to guess when I feel like my food is cooked, because burn message won't resolve. Could be a great product, but this single flaw is a big one and a dealbreaker for me."
2.0 out of 5 stars,"I got this pot because my friends were talking how fast it cooks.  I bought totally three one for me, one for my daughter and one for my son.  I use it almost every other day.  I was so happy and told about it to my other friends.  But this morning something went wrong while I had it on for pressure cooking.  It stopped half way thru and all the lights went out.  So I checked my outlet and circuit etc.  Concluded that the problem was the insta pot itself.  I would like to return so that the product can be fixed and improved on."
2.0 out of 5 stars,"I had a 6-quart Instant Pot Duo for a few years that worked perfectly.  I handed it down to a family member and bought a new one, confident that it would perform the same as the old one did.  I get the burn error with most things now, things that I never had a problem with on my old one.  I contacted customer support.  They had me run ""tests,"" which all came out fine because they were conducted with nothing but water, and informed me that the unit is operating as intended.  I don't know what they changed since they first came out, but the newer units are most definitely not as reliable as older ones.  I guess I am going to try a different brand and hand this one down to someone else.  Very disappointed."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Had to have Corned Beef & Cabbage (& potatoes) for St. Patrick’s Day.  Think about it ... corned beef is good ... not great, but goes great with Guinness.  Let me tell ya ... after cooking up the corned beef using a YouTube recipie, with Guinness, wow!  I’d put it up against any filet or NY steak.  Not hype ... really, really good!  We’ve done a dozen or so recipies now; really impressive.  Got it on Amazon for $20 less than it was on sale at Macy’s."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I can throw in frozen chicken breasts, potatoes and carrots and have dinner on the table in less than 45 minutes!  Cook times are short but keep in mind it takes time to get up to pressure and then more time to depressurize.  Worth the wait!  I love the saute feature too.  I'm terrible with rice and even though I cooked it on the rice setting according to instructions it still was not done.  Going to have to work on that."
4.0 out of 5 stars,Great quick way to infuse flavor into food and cook foods quickly that would take hours on the stove top via a regular cooking pot.  If you are looking to the Instant Pot to duplicate the results you get from a stove top pressure cooker. The results will not be the same.  When I made a black bean soup in the Instant pot it was lacking the texture and creamyness you get from a stove top pressure cooker.  The nice thing about the instant pot is it doesn't need any baby sitting like a stove top pressure cooker.
4.0 out of 5 stars,"Tough to add to the rave reviews. I made a pot roast for my instant pot debut following the recipe in the blog. I was nervous to walk away but did and everything turned out as predicted. Well, I make better gravy than the recipe in the blog so I should have stuck with my own. I had a somewhat lean cut of roast but it was pretty moist even after the vegetables. I would add half a star more and only hold back because the bottom of the pot came out discolored after the clean up (followed instructions). So sad to lose that stainless steel finish going out of the gate, but I will be keeping it."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is a great invention. My husband thought I would never use it. Boy, was he wrong. I use it almost every night. As a matter of fact, this is my 2nd one. I also have the 8 qt. I bought the 3 qt because sometimes the 8 qt is more than I need. I would definitely recommend this product! It makes dinner so fast and easy. The thing I love about it most, if you forget to thaw your meat, you just pop it in the IP and 20 minutes later it’s cooked. No defrosting."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"If you don't already own a slow cooker or rice cooker and were considering one or both, don't.  The InstaPot is all you need.  I bought this primarily for the pressure cooker/rice cooker/veggie steamer options, but it's nice to have one pot that does all of this -- and so much more.  I read a lot of glowing reviews, but still wasn't expecting to love it as much as I do!  I am most impressed with how well made it is, and how simple it is to use (so many preprogrammed options).  Made an amazing shredded chicken dish for the family last night in no time at all, all in one pot.  And clean up was a snap. If the discounted price remains in effect (I bought it during the Black Friday promo) I am considering ""sharing the love"" and bestowing this as a Christmas gift for a lucky few:)"
5.0 out of 5 stars,This is a great instant pot. It saves me a ton of time. I can cook roast from frozen to cooked perfectly in this pot.  I have made all kinds of things in it so versatility gets 5 stars. The inner pot is dishwasher safe and cleans up nicely. Five stars on safety. It automatically switches over to warm for a specified length of time when the cooking is finished. I would definitely recommend.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I am enjoying my 3 qt. IP. It’s the perfect size when I am cooking for 2 or 3 of us. Great for steaming veggies. They are done in no time. I use it for so many other things as well. I have two 6 qts, but when I can I opt to us the smaller one. For me it is smaller and easier to handle when it comes time to clean and store."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I’ve only used it once so far, and I can see there will be a bit of a learning curve but I threw some frozen chicken breasts, potatoes and cream of chicken soup and pressure cooked or for 40 minutes and it was like a meal cooking in the crockpot all day. I’m SOLD."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Already had the 6 qt but wanted the yogurt button on the 8 qt. I often use them at the same time. One for rice,corn on the cob,potatoes or veggies & the other the main entree. Should have bought it sooner. Tried another brand from Costco but took it back due to not as good a pot as the stainless steel one in the instant pot. Making yogurt is the best thing ever, so inexpensive and tastes better than store bought. I hated yogurt before this. I have made cheesecake,ribs,applesauce,roast,pulled pork,burrito meat,banana bread,rice,stroganoff, fried rice. Was so tired of cooking and this has turned that around like nobody's business. So easy & quick and can put frozen chicken breasts in and done in 24 min. Saves energy costs and way less cleanup. My go to online for recipes is the instant pot community. Can't go wrong!!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have cooked alot of differant foods in it and am very pleased on how it comes out. The ""food burn"" alert has worked perfictly to alert me when there was not enough liquid in the pot. For todays fast paced life styles, it is a good addition to the kitchen or camper."
2.0 out of 5 stars,"They keep on redesigning the pressure relief valve (and making it worse). I gave my original 8 qt duo to a friend when I bought an 8 qt ultra on sale. The ultra has never sealed correctly, takes forever to build up pressure. I'm hoping gen 3 will fix the problem. I really miss my old 8 qt instant pot."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Pressure cooker cuts down cooking time. Ability to break down meats and bones without breaking down too much the vegetables like carrots. Also, very little heat escapes; so great for cooking in the summer too. Also, very little smell escapes; so living room with open kitchen won’t be smelling like food for days. All great advantages!"
1.0 out of 5 stars,"The air fryer lid worked well and did what I needed it to do. There were times I wished it was a bit bigger but that's on me for choosing the size. All in all I was satisfied until it stopped working today. I plugged it in as usual but its now stuck on off. I've pressed all the buttons, tried different outlets but it still won't work.The idea is great but $80 to rent it for 4 months is too steep for me. I liked the device itself and would've given it a better rating but 4 months is too short of a lifespan. Maybe I got a defect but buyer beware because you have the same chances I did to get one that breaks on you in less than half a year."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"I love it!  The instructions were a little weird specially with the valve part, but i youtube it and the end result was Amazing! I put FROZEN wings in there with all my seasonings and in 35 min my family was eating! Only thing... its hard to clean. But no biggie, the overall item & result is amazing. No issues, the pressure release was a little scary at first... you get put to it pretty quick! So glad i bought this!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"The ""Instant Pot"" Pressure Cooker is absolutely everything the reviews say it is! This is the new futuristic way to cook! Welcome to quick healthy meals with the ""Instant Pot""...it's about time! This is the real deal! Tonight was the first time I used it...and I didn't hold back, no starting small for me, heck no! BBQ Pork Roast - 25 minutes, Fresh Corn on the Cob - 4 minutes, Twice Baked Potatoes - 5 minutesIt was truly a FANTASTIC Meal!Corn was crisp and juicy with a wonderful flavor.Potatoes, I used those to make Twice ""Baked"" Potatoes...perfect texture..they were small Red Potatoes.BBQ Pork Roast (actually a gigantic Boneless Country Rib we bought at Sam's) I was skeptical about the ribs, I mean Wow!  We could hardly wait to open the lid and see how the roast turned out...we were not disappointed! You have to try this machine!"
4.0 out of 5 stars,"Mostly I like it. It does a very nice job on alot of types of foods. I love the yogurt function. I like the timer and the keep warm is very useful. Mostly I'm disappointed because for a lot of things it's just not any faster than regular cooking. Oh you can cook steel cut oats in 10-15, but that doesn't included the 15 minutes to get up to pressure and the fifteen minutes for pressure to release, in the end it's just faster to do it the old fashion way. Roasted meats, 90 minutes to cook the corn beef 20 minutes to come up to pressure 15 to release, still less than 3 hours, but still not the time saver I was hoping for... This would be true of any pressure cooker so nothing off this model which overall I'm happy with."
5.0 out of 5 stars,I love love love this thing!!!  I was hesitant to buy it cause I had a crockpot and didn’t use it that much but this is a whole other level of cool. I literally just throw in my FROZEN meat and it cooks within an hour max. Then on top of it I can make a whole meal and a side all at the same time in this. I have recommended this to friends and family. It’s amazing.
4.0 out of 5 stars,"I've had this since November 2016 however, a few days ago it suddenly will not power on. I've opened a ticket on 2/20/17 but so far I've receive no response from the support group. I am not sure what the failure rate on these units are, but what good is this item if you can only use it for a few months. I'll update this review if I can get in contact support.The unit worked well for the period of time that it was functioning. It was pretty easy to use; plug in the unit -> add the items that needed to be cooked -> cover -> select cooking method -> done. I like the stainless steel inner container.UPDATE: 3/17/17Support did get back to me and shipped me a new base unit. Received it 2 days ago. Tested it and it's working well."
5.0 out of 5 stars,I did a ton of research before deciding which pressure cooker to purchase. I have been so happy with my choice. This is super easy to use and easy to clean (which is a must for me) It is very versatile and the extra safety features make sure I don't do anything stupid to injure myself lol. I love that I can just put everything in (even when I forgot to pre think out dinner) and viola there is an amazing healthy meal.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Having no previous experience with a pressure cooker of any sort, I am finding a steep learning curve with this appliance but I am very impressed with it.I strongly urge reading the instructions carefully and making certain that you understand them before starting. There are lots of recipes on line for both pressure cookers and  the Instant Pot.One thing I have found useful when doing an instant release of the pressure is to have a heavy kitchen towel to put over the release valve to prevent burns from the steam being released, it sometimes spits hot water during this time as well.I am happy with the appliance and having fun learning to use it."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This product is very, very  versatile.  Definitely one-pot cooking at its best!  I'm just starting to experiment with the many recipes available online and just recently learned there is a two-pot insert that can be purchased to make, for example, mashed potatoes and meatloaf at the same time.  Holy cow!  You can ""presoak"" dried beans for delectable chili in about 30 minutes instead of six-to-eight hours!  I also bought an Instant Pot Duo for my oldest son, who lives by himself,  and he loves it.  He sends me pictures of the gourmet meals he's made in it.  My household family is large enough that I'm thinking about buying the 8-quart model next once I become more accustomed to this 6-quart model.  Happy Dining!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Amazing product.  I describe it as if a slow cooker, pressure cooker, and dutch oven/hot plate made a beautiful baby with a timer.  I downloaded the app (Instant Pot in your app store) and search what I've got ""chicken thighs"" ""red pepper"" and up comes recipes.  So far everything I've made turned out great ""mom it's good!"" - and I ""sort of"" followed the recipes.  All in one pot!  I usually have everything clean by the time the food is ready.  I really really really love it.  Also got a great cookbook for a Christmas gift: The Essential Instant Pot Cookbook by Coco Morante - I recommend!  FTWMom of 2 with a ""chef-ie"" husband - omnivores.  Do it!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This pot is amazing.  I bought this pot to replace an oval pressure cooker I bought from QVC and used a great deal until I dropped the lid and put a crack in the plastic top.  While the pot still worked I was uneasy using it.  I thought I really liked that one until I started to use this one.  First the fact that the inner pot is stainless and not coated is one of the best features.  Even though the other manufactures claim the interiors are scratch proof, there are scratches in the pot whenever you use any metal to turn the meat when browning.  For those reviews that say the stainless interior of the pot discolors - just use a little vinegar and water to remove them. It comes right off.  This can happen with any stainless and high heat.This pot comes up to temperature quickly and the choice of specific food settings makes programming so easy and fast.  Additionally, you can customize it to your particular needs.I also bought the extra insert pot and lid.  I wasn't sure if I would really use it, but it has proved to be a great time saver as I often prepare multiple meals to freeze and use later.  When the first is done, I simply remove it from the pot to let it cool a little, and pop the second in to start cooking.If there is one thing I would have wished for is that it was oval and 6 quart.  I am cooking for 6-7 people and a larger capacity would have been great.  Also the oval shape allows for longer pot roasts and meats to fit a little better.  All things considered though this has been one of the best purchases I have made."
1.0 out of 5 stars,"Returning unit. Wasted chicken, multiple vegetables, spices, heavy cream, milk... I could go on. Clean, cool pot. Ample ligquid. Rice Pudding seemed a no-brainer following approved book, BURN. Weekend Gumbo. BURN. And so on."
5.0 out of 5 stars,I gave this to my daughter and the meals she's cooked for me in this pot are incredibly delish and so quick. I want one of my own now.
4.0 out of 5 stars,"Its a great kitchen tool , Stainless steel inner pot is the best thing ever!No noise like stove top pressure cooker, no need to keep an eye on it , can cook 2-3 items at the same time in it using pot in pot.Only drawback is silicon ring which catches all the smells of food we cook. That took a star for me. I bought it for Thanks giving so I got a good deal of it!! Bottom line .... love it."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I got on the Instant Pot bandwagon a little late. But this product is just amazing. I have been able to make complex meals which I never thought were possible, thanks to the wide availability of recipes online. It is quick and easy to clean up and store. I have owned it for just over a month and use it about three times a week. We have drastically cut down on eating out. The flavors are amazing since the food really doesn't get burned. I have been getting compliments from my family. I really didn't want to get another kitchen appliance to clutter up my counter top but I can't imagine not having this gadget in my life."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Happy, happy happy wife, mom and keto eater!  So is my family!  This was easy to use right out of the box and had been used a few times a week since I got it.  I don't eat grain or sugar which means I cook often and there are not many quick dinners but this changed that.  I know that I can prepare a good meal that tastes like it slow cooked all day in just a few hours.  My favorite is chicken thighs - HOLLY SMOKES!!!  So Yummy!!!  The BEST broth ever!!!  The broth was so think and yummy that it alone was a filling and nutritious meal.  The chicken was so flavorful and I used it for meals for several days."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"HOLY CRAP this thing is amazing!! I cannot believe I have been living my life w/o this. People search for soul mates their whole lives and when they finally find the one...they just know.....This is like that with me and kitchen gadgets...I just knew it was missing from my life, and now that I have it...my fast cooked..fall off the bone beef rib dreams are complete...I have cooked lamb with it, grains, ribs, ohhh...salivating mouth, control thy self...I would buy this again in a heart beat..yes..I would...but next time if I can find the 8 qt one, I'd for for that....just like a soul mate...sometimes gotta trade em' in for a model w/bigger space."
5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazing machine! The different functions make this pot such a versatile product. I have been able to saute and pressure cooker to make chili. This instant pot makes life so much easier and tastier!
5.0 out of 5 stars,I fondly call my instant Pot my computer in the kitchen. 😀Am a pretty lazy cook. Didn't realize I was pampered for the first 40 years of my life - where cooking was done by me only when I felt like it - and that was rarelyWatching a dish cook and keeping a count of pressure cooker whistles - I hateThis gadget is perfect for me - and now pretty late in life - I am learning to cook and semi enjoying it
4.0 out of 5 stars,"Black Friday deal...  description said damaged box.  Could tell it was an ""open-box"" only because plastic bag around accessories.  Other than that - perfect.  Have not used but for this price it was well worth the deal.  My friends say that once I use it I will not know how I went so long with out one.  Much less eating out after a long day at work.If this is so....  worth the gamble!Ordered Thanksgiving around 2pm.  Received by 1pm on Saturday..LOVE PRIME!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This has been a lifesaver in our household. My partner is a chef who doesn't have energy to cook after work, especially in these times. I am not very fast in the kitchen, so by the time I get of work and make dinner it is 10 pm.This has made everything so much easier.Plus there are a lot of fun things for him to play with like the yogurt maker or canning features."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"I love this product so far. Was a little intimidated at first by its size but watched a few videos on you tube that walked you through the water test and all the parts. Now I feel completely comfortable and have made 4 meals, including one starting with frozen meat. It is amazing!I'm glad I bought the 8 quart for my family of four. It allows us to have some leftovers for the next day for lunch.The only reason I give this 4 stars and not 5 is that our lid had a crack in the plastic handle that I noticed on the first use. It did not affect the pot any and we had already destroyed the box, but for $100+ pot I did not expect to receive a device that was damaged. I will keep my fingers crossed it was not a returned item with other issues.Something to keep in mind is while recipes list the cook time, the pot must heat up first and that takes about 10 mins or so. Then after the times cooking it must cool down naturally or even when you use the quick release it takes some time. So factor that in to your time allotment. Even so it is still very fast and convenient."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Although I’ve only used it a limited number of time so far, I love it, and I’m very pleased with all results. It is quick, easy, and the meat somehow or another taste even better, very tender. I bought a cookbook for it and have downloaded lots of recipes which I’m eager to use."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I was not sure what all the hype was about surrounding the Instant Pot but I'm now a believer! We are trying to slim down the amount of stuff we have in our house so buying another kitchen appliance was a tough discussion. After having the chance to use it I can say that it will replace at least 3 appliances/utensils we have cluttering up the cabinets. It's great because it's as intimidating as a stove top pressure cooker and it cooks fast with great results. The meat turns out juicy, tender and there is only one pot to clean up. There are also many great recipes out there to get started with. I started with the basic pressure cooker and saute settings to familiarize myself with it and will build from there (yum yogurt). I did decide to get the 8 quart for stocks and other things. It's a pretty big appliance but it's worth it. If you are even questioning whether or not you would need the bigger one I would just size up."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm sure you've heard many people talk about their Instant Pot. I know many people that have 2 or 3 of them and make entire dinners along with sides in these. They are easy to use, and do not have much of a learning curve. My favorite thing to make in them is rice! It's so much more versatile than your traditional rice cooker, though and I have made several meals in it. If you have already made the decision to get a pressure cooker, but are uncertain on spending more money for this one rather than the many off-brands, I strongly recommend you get this brand. Pressure cookers can be dangerous if the seal is defective. I think it is more than worth it to spend the extra money on a tried-and-true brand in the name of safety."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great product. Love that I can attached it to the other machine without buying a whole new thing to have and store. Little bulky to pull off the one top and attach this top is a bit of a hassle, thus the 4 stars. Very easy to use, it’s quiet and the charm that alerts me that it’s finished cooking just the right pitch. We use it all the time to make homemade French fries."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This thing is AMAZING! I received this as a gift from my family at Christmas. I've always been leary of pressure cookers from when I was little and my mom used one for canning, but this is so user friendly. Seriously, first use today and tried chicken & dumplings, something I rarely make due to the time involved and never getting the dumplings right. It came out perfect! Even my moody, picky teens liked it! Can't wait to try something else! The picture if of what little was left after we devoured it!"
1.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought mine in Feb, worked great until 2 weeks ago.  It stopped locking.  I noticed while making white rice, steam coming out of the front of the lid and the sides.  Within a few minutes it started to alarm with the ""burn notice"".  I've attempted a few more times, and still, it will not lock-in.  I really don't want to spend another $80 on one.  If its under warranty, that would be awesome.  if not under warranty, then I'll be buying another brand."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"This is the third instant pot I bought and the best so far.  It is tight sealed when cooking and it is super efficient. It comes with nice warmer feature. The only problem is that you have to position it accurately when closing the lid, it takes multiple attempts to close it."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have been using my insta pot weekly for 2 years. So I had to give this space saving addition a try. It arrived this morning and was well packaged.  To start with I just had to make JoJos. I haven’t had a good one in many years. The jojos came out great, so then I made potato chips, then jojos again where I sliced the wedges in a way so that I could get twice the yield. My wife initially didn’t want another appliance but is now a huge fan. Air fried mushroom, eggplant, brussel sprouts are next on the list. - great product for a couple. Thank you."
4.0 out of 5 stars,There are a ton of youtube videos for ways to cook with this thing.  One of my favorite things about it is how easy it is to poach eggs.  Rice is super simple.  The downside is that it's just one giant pot so making something that has elements with different cooking times takes some practice.  I would suggest getting this size since you can still use it for making something like 2 eggs whereas you can't stuff a big chicken into the small one.  Kitchen space is something to consider before buying.  The power cord is really short.  That's why I gave it 4 stars.  It needs to be very near an outlet.  It's around 2.5' long.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is a great product, super easy to cook and super easy to clean! It has transformed our evening meals, since it cooks so well. We are less likely to need freezer meals or go out to restaurants."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love, Love, Love, my Instant Pot.  Took me a while to decide on this brand, model and size.  I did a lot of research, reading comments and reviews before I purchased the 6qt.  This is a prefect size for a family of 4 and I have left overs as well.  At first I was scared to use the Pressure Cooker with all the warning but honestly it was really easy. So far I have made several different types of beans without soaking them overnight, Rice and Chicken and steam vegetable, and everything has come out prefect! Highly recommend this product!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I can't begin to describe how life-changing it has been to have this appliance in my home. It has functioned flawlessly, with the only mishaps related to my own mistakes, like forgetting to close the vent or add water. Our food is more flavorful and dinner cooks in record time. We have saved money on our grocery bill because it isn't a hassle to cook from basic ingredients in the IP-DUO, so we aren't going out to eat or even heating up convenience foods much anymore. The IP makes cheaper cuts of meat seem like a more expensive cut. It's so easy to use too! I love that I can, to some degree, ""Set it and forget it.""  The built-in safety features reinforce my confidence in this product. I recommend it to friends and gift them to family."
1.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased this item in January 2020. I put the box in a safe place and opened it on May 30th. The top of the Insta pot does not close properly so when I used the water test several times the steam was coming out all over. I used the utube help for this item and the top still does not fit properly. I am very frustrated with this item. Looking over the details I had to send it back in Feb 2020 to receive a refund. Is there any way I can return this item as it does not work properly. thank you, Paula Martinez"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"There is nothing about this cooker that I dislike. I would recommend this cooker or one like it to anyone. The 3 quart size is perfect for me. I have seen cookers like it on tv for many years, and now I have one that I am proud to have. It came with a manual and a cook book. The cook book gives clear instructions an is easy to use.Now for the bad part. The only problem I had was with amazons delivery service. I received an e-mail from amazon that said that my cooker could not be left in a secure place, and therefore was not delivered. this was on a Saturday. I called customer service (I had to use Google to find that number) to complain. My cooker was delivered the next day."
1.0 out of 5 stars,"Leaked continuously.  They gave me perfunctory replies. I pressed. Had to video the whole thing and send it to them.  They sent me the replacement bottom part.  The thing leaked water into the system and shorted out, tripping my breakers. They sent a replacement unit.  Then that one stopped working but it was out of warranty."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"It helps my cooking much easily and save time. The most favorite thing for me is I can throw a frozen meat with all the ingredients in the IP, then push a button to start! Done! The food come out with yummy taste and we really like it.Anyways, it depends on what recipes you are going to make as well because sometimes it’s easier and faster to cook on the stove top because the IP needs around 15-20 mins to build up the pressure before cooking"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I’ve wanted an electric pressure cooker for YEARS, I’m so glad I waited & purchased the Instant Pot Duo/Mini.  Although I’m still learning HOW to use it, it has more than paid for itself in convenience!  What used to take all day in a crock pot now takes maybe an hour and a half. (Non soaked dried beans) I won’t lie, this Cajun even made a SMALL gumbo in it for my son & I. The sauté setting was perfect for the veggies & once I added the water, seasonings and Roux I used it again for about 30 mins to get it all just right. Put in the chicken & sausage, followed by about 30-45 mins using the stew setting it was done!  (Always check the internal temps of meat to ensure proper cooking)"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I used to use an electric pressure cooker that had a non-stick inner pot. I was concerned that this one would stick badly but once I soak it in some soapy water, I have had no issue with cleaning it easily.  The Instant pot is so versatile and you can make so many different kinds of dishes in it. It is very fun to play around with and always very easy."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love this! We use it several times a week. Plus, it makes the best boiled eggs I've ever made, they are so easy to peel! (High pressure with a cup of water for 2 minutes and natural release for about 10 minutes). It does come with a learning curve and I ruined about the first 3 things I tried in it, but once you get the hang of it it's a must have appliance in the kitchen. Now I make homeade yogurt weekly, quick dry beans, amazing meats, ect."
3.0 out of 5 stars,"A bit disappointed.  It cooks super fast but everything comes out a bit bland.Doing a bunch of research this isn't unusual, and can be remedied simply by dumping tons of seasoning in.  Seasoning is really expensive which makes me loathe dumping tons of it in just to get things tasting like they do with conventional methods.On the good side, cooking really is fast.  Cooking even frozen chicken quarters takes less than an hour for super tender juicy pieces.  Now if only they weren't bland"
4.0 out of 5 stars,"Many people told me that I wouldn’t like it. I believe the people that say that don’t learn how to cook with it. I use mine at least twice a week and love it. One thing I suggest is to use your imagination and you can cook many things the way you want to, even starting out from frozen to done in far less time than thawing and then cooking. I love mine!"
3.0 out of 5 stars,"It browns fine, but it is deep and small. I would probably choose a larger tray-like device with slide out function if I were ordering today. It does work well with the Instant Pot, which is why I purchased it over other items."
5.0 out of 5 stars,I got the 6 QT Instant Pot to replace my old crock pot and rice cooker - all the other features are a bonus to me. I decided to try the pressure cooker feature and oh man was I pleasantly surprised. I made a pot roast in under and hour! My husband said if I wouldn’t have told him he would have assumed it was slow cooked all day. I’m still getting use to the pressure cooker feature and how to adjust recipes but I’m impressed. It’s easy to use and now I only have one appliance instead of several taking up precious storage space in my kitchen. I think the 6 QT is perfect for a small family. I would size up if you need to make meals for a large family.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Cooking frozen meat within minutes is insane. I heard people talking about this product in the office, all positive. We tried it out, and it's amazing. Time savings is the main benefit, but I would say it's opened up our weekly menu. There were things I avoided cooking during the week because of the time to cook/defrost. Now I can make whatever I want without worrying about time constraints. Takes a bit to figure out how to use, there are a ton of different cooking options and methods."
5.0 out of 5 stars,I had two house visitors for two months and I bought this before they arrived. We used it often and the food was delicious! A great way to cook with ease.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"There are a thousand reviews on here that say the same thing, but let me add to it.  This thing is awesome.  I hesitated buying it as it's huge, and I'm generally cooking for one but so far it hasn't been an issue. I do a lot of what is called pot-in-pot cooking. I have a couple of small metal bowls that I use for cooking smaller quantities of rice & oatmeal.  I love that I don't have to babysit it like I do if I'm trying to make oatmeal on the stove. I cooked a whole butternut squash in it the other day and that was amazing.  I've also cooked one pot pasta which was great.  Garbanzo beans, beans and rice, potatoes and eggs.....it handles it all with ease. I love it. The photo is potato corn chowder, with brussels sprouts and garlic roasted in the

5.0 out of 5 stars,"I had previously purchased a different brand from another store (an as seen on tv brand), and I tried it a few times but didn't like it. That one took forever to build up pressure, and there was all sorts of foam spewing out of the release valve when it was finished cooking but the parts appeared to all be fine.There are so many videos and recipes specifically for the Instant Pot, and there are more control options for it so I decided to try it. I love it, it builds up pressure in no time at all compared to the other one.I love being able to cook frozen items so quickly so I don't have to bother with thawing chicken any more."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Highly reccommended. Will change your cooking to include less fried and oil soaked food. Anyone can use this.Cooks up hard grains and pulses, dals and beans for the week's meals in a jiffy. All you need to do is presoak them. You'll also need a deep heat proof bowl to hold your batch of beans. I use a deep mixing bowl made of pyrex glass. Any steep sided heavy bowl will do. Invest in a the rack and the silcone finger mittens and you are all set."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"We bought this a few weeks ago since we have been hearing so much about them and let me tell you, these are the best thing to come around since sliced bread. Basically we haven't had anything to eat in 2 weeks that hasn't been made in the instant pot. The pot itself comes with a recipe book and there are so many more online and we are yet to find a recipe that isn't amazing. The build of the Pot is super sturdy as well. highly recommend."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Use almost every day. Simple to operate. Even my husband love it .Use for soups, fresh beans etc"
5.0 out of 5 stars,This has been a fantastic addition to our kitchen.  We have had a lot of fun experimenting with it and cooking all the options it makes available.  The best feature has to be going from frozen food to cooked dinner in enough time to make it feasible for a weeknight that alone has saved us way more than this cost.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I just love my Instant Pot. I hated cooking before this and now I can’t stop thinking about cooking in my Instant Pot. Instant Pot gave my life purpose. It is so easy and most things are completely prepared in the Pot so clean up is incredibly easy. I love the yogurt that this pot makes and it couldn’t be easier. If you’re thinking about getting one of these it’s time to just go and do it. You won’t be sorry and will wish you had bought one before now. Go ahead, click that buy button, NOW! I promise, you won’t regret it."
5.0 out of 5 stars,This is like the 5th IP I purchased in Amazon and never regretted. This one’s a gift for my daughter in Florida. I just returned from visiting and gave her and several friends lessons on how useful it is. Most friends were delighted and interested in getting one too.
1.0 out of 5 stars,The device's controls are not very intuitive and the instructions are not detailed enough. It stopped working after 2 months of infrequent use. Theres nothing instant about it other than its failure potential.
1.0 out of 5 stars,The steam release feature on these is very clunky and dangerous considering how new and fancy they are.  We loved the range of things the pot should have been able to do but the thing that catches water broke the first use and the ribs we pressure cooked weren't tender at all.  If we had just used it as a slow cooker we probably would still have it.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I will say not everything needs to be cook in one of these things but for soups and such I don't think you can get a better option for speed and taste. Got this on sale which makes it even better, Go ahead and order you one you will not regret it.Takes some getting use to cooking with it but after that, it's a breeze. Do the water test when you first get it to make sure yours works. Don't want to get  ready to make your first meal and then something go wrong."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Absolutely love this thing! Have always enjoyed cooking, but definitely not the time it took, so there was more eating out and frozen pizzas than I’d like to admit. Not an issue with the pressure cooker. Since purchasing, I have become a domestic goddess, and I use it all the time. Soups, roasts, cheesecakes, there is an endless list of things you can prepare in a sliver of the amount of time it’d normally take. Cleanup is easy too."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"the first use of it is to make congee 2 days ago. it works well, i didn't put enough water at first, and after cook for a while, the screen says ""burn"" it was not burn but it is just the rice stick to the bottom of the pan. so I am glad it didnt continue to cook when it detects the rice stick to the bottom. therefore we like it so far. in addition, it has a cooking recipe and the item and water ratio for cooking."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have been pressure cooking for 30 years. But this instant pot is so durable and the options are numerous. I love the ease of cleaning and not having so many other cookers on my counter like a rice cooker, crockpot and pressure cooker. This does it all! I like the instant pot so much I bought a 3 quart for smaller amount recipes. I highly recommend this for any kitchen especially if you are pressured for time. We made ribs, pot roast and soups and all came out delicious!!!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I like to buy this machine after a visit to a friends house and see the performance. I cook everyday and at home we like to prepare delicious and organic meals.  This pot is perfect for soups, beans, rice and more.  The setup is very easy and the pressure cooker is fast and without the smell and steam whistle that a regular pressure cooker has."
3.0 out of 5 stars,I received my 6qt today and tested four times but have a question.Are these suppose to release steam (high and low pressure settings) for approx. 1-2 mins after cooking timer starts?  I have two other pressure cookers from Insignia and once you put the pressure release valve in the closed positions they do not allow steam to shoot out until I put the valve in the open position.  My Instant Pot allows steam to escape for 1-2 mins after cooking timer begins counting down.  Is my pressure release valve defective?
4.0 out of 5 stars,"I have made a couple of things so far using it for rice, pasta, slow cooker and pressure.  Still getting the hang of it.Have not been able to make rice well yet.  Would be great if there was an actual cooking instruction/recipe book that came with it.  You get some pretty vague instructions and so you have to google it."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is the SECOND one I bought so decided I better write a review! I love this thing! I bought my first one on Prime Day this year, after having watched the price in my wishlist for at least three months. I really wanted one after seeing so many people rave above it online but really wanted a better price LOL! In hindsight, I would have gladly paid full price.I have used the IP several times a week in the last 5 months. I use it so much I was planning on buying another SS insert to have more flexibility. Instead, when the price dropped on black Friday, I bought another one! Twice this week I have had both my main dish and a side dish going at the same time. All of this coming from someone who dislikes most kitchen ""gadgets""!So far, I have used mostly the manual setting for pressure cooking. I use it for main dish meats or one pot-type meals. The saute function makes the prep work so easy, with one pan to clean. I use it to cook potatoes for potato salad (right along with the eggs!) or for mashed potatoes. Speaking of eggs...hard-cooked farm fresh eggs from the IP are a dream to peel! If you have ever used farm fresh eggs you know that peeling them when they are hard cooked is enough to make anyone cry-not with the IP! It makes wonderful rice of all kinds. I used to really hate cooking brown rice although I know it's healthier. The IP makes it as easy as cooking white rice. It also makes wonderful black or forbidden rice.I have also used the IP to heat the milk for making yogurt and have made yogurt in 8 ounce canning jars placed on the trivet in the pot. When they are done, put a lid on them and right into the fridge. I no longer need my dedicated yogurt maker!I gave away my slow cooker. I have made 6 or 8 different kinds of soups in the pot, on the slow cooker function so far. In addition, I have made some chicken stock that has gelled better than any other stock I have ever made.Cheesecake! The most wonderful cheesecakes can be made in the IP! Thankfully they are little!In conclusion, if you are on the fence about buying this appliance, just do it, even at full price! It is so worth it! I cook a lot and this has been so much fun to use. It is one gadget that has earned a permanent place in my kitchen!"
4.0 out of 5 stars,"Having always used a traditional pressure cooker, this pot took some getting used to. I have to pick time (ok I thought that was the easy part but since you have to wait for pressure to drop it's easy to overcook food!), level, account for settling time if you had veggies after. It's not so easy w/o a recipe. I do like that it's versatile & can use it as a slow cooker, steamer etc, but I imagine that's just as complex..."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"The Instant Pot was quite easy to use.  However, at first, it was difficult placing the lid on the cooker.  Recommend arrow placement on the lid be a different color with a corresponding arrow on the pot so the user can line up the lid to the pot.  After several tries, I was able to line it up.  The pot tells user almost everything on the screen.  When it was getting dry, it indicated ""burnt""  IT works well as a pressure cooker, slow cooker, steamer....very versatile."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I recommend anyone to buy this if they want to cook ribs.  like the BEST ribs.Oh and also other stuff.  I have a family of 5 hungry eaters and it is good, this size or size up one."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love that his can cook in a short amount of time. It cooks so fast and saves me kitchen time. I have not had any troubles with it and I have used mine for about a year I think. Still going strong after soups, roasts, meat and gravy, rice, shredded pork, etc.. The silicon seal ring can get stinky depending on what you cook so I recommend replacing after a year or so if needed."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"As a person who works in IT, we tend to look for a solution which automates a process with minimum possible manual steps involved.Now, I usually do not cook. At all.I spent so much money eating out in so many years, it does not make any sense to keep doing it.So, I was looking for a magical solution to my cooking problems (and of course laziness). I found the Instant pot.It's not magic. But close. I found so many recipes online.The recipe I tried is Dal Thadka. The recipe said Cooking time - 10 minutes.I was thinking to myself, that's a load of bull. But, I was wrong. It is actually 5 - 7 minutes at high pressure.I was blown away. It takes the same amount of time to decide on a restaurant and order delivery.Thank You for this innovation."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Perfect edition to my instant pot family. The small three quart has become my daily favorite because of its size, lighter weight, and smaller footprint."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This thing can make you look like a cooking champ.  Soups, stews, chicken, pork, veggies, whatever you want.  I don't know what took me so long to get one of these pots.  I've had a crock pot for --years-- and it never got used that much; I always found a way to burn the bottom of the pot.  This thing has yet to burn anything, the controller is very good at keeping the food at temp without getting too hot.  I can go from a pile of groceries to a pot of chili in under an hour, including all the prep.  I've thrown a bunch of stuff in it the night before and had awesome soups the next night for dinner when I got home, no burnt chunks in the bottom."
5.0 out of 5 stars,This brings the pressure cooker into the new millenium.  For years I had been lead to believe that pressure cookers were either dangerous or turned food to mush.  Not so.  And this nicely combines the pressure-cooker and crock pot into a single appliance.  Saves cupboard space by having only one.  Haven't tried it as a rice cooker (a little large for that unless you are running a restaurant).  It is nice to be able to saute and then switch to pressure cook in the same pot.
5.0 out of 5 stars,This is an amazing product.  Wish we had bought it years ago.  So easy to use - user friendly features - really does work quickly to cook meals that are just delicious.  If this one wears out we will certainly purchase another one.  Arrived timely - easy to understand directions (safety features are important & easy to understand).  This works amazingly well.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Wasn't sure whether I should buy one but now that I have it and have used it 5 times, I really like it.  I made potato salad and was able to pressure the potatoes and even the eggs for hard boiled eggs at the same time in just 6 minutes.  I look forward to making yogurt and cheese cake soon."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Amazon, as usual, delivered quickly.  I have tried this pot once so far.  My suggestions: First, make sure you read the directions and do an initial test to get a feel for using a pressure cooker.  I have never used one before, so was leery of making mistakes.  My first attempt was a 1.5 lb pork roast.  The recipe book that comes with the pot has only a few recipes, but does have a cooking chart.  My roast was smaller than anything on the cooking chart so I explored online.  Found a basic recipe for 1.5 lb pressure cooked pork roast.Simple recipe:  1.5 lb pork roast, 1 onion sliced, 1 garlic clove, 1 T oil, 1 cup water.  Important to brown the meat in the oil in the pressure cooker first to seal in the juices/flavor.  Then deglaze the pot (I had to look this up to as I didn't know how to deglaze :)  put in the trivet, the pork on the trivet and the remaining ingredients.  I added salt and pepper and a sprig of fresh rosemary.  Close the pot, push the meat button, change the time to 25 minutes.  That is it!  The pork was juicy, tender and perfectly cooked.It took about 9 minutes for the cooker to come up to pressure and about 15 minutes after the cook time for the natural release and the pressure to come back to normal before opening the pot. The lid can't be removed unless the float valve drops down anyway - love that safety feature!  Clean up was easy too.  I was concerned it would not be easy as the interior pot is stainless and does not have a non-stick coating.  However, I was pleasantly surprised at how easy it was to clean.  So far, I love this pot. Trying a chicken today.  If that isn't as easy, I may be editing this report.  This may become my new favorite cooking tool!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm an older guy who could never cook AND always fell off the low-carb/keto wagon because eating the same 3 dishes eventually go SO boring, I couldn't stand it anymore. This device allows me to cook an amazing variety of LC/Keto dishes quickly and easily. My choices are truly endless. Thai food, French, Italian, and that's just the beginning. And the community behind it amazingly supportive. I am 80 lbs lighter and I KNOW I can keep it off this time. And I eat better now than at any time in my life. So, yes, it has indeed changed my life!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I waited a while before posting this review because I had serious doubts about how something in this price range could perform.After using the product for some time I can't report anything negative about it.  It is excellent at poultry, quick artichokes, lamb shanks, roasts, etc.  The slow cook feature is great if you want to start something in the morning and have it ready for dinner.The product has a solid feel, and everything has worked flawlessly since I got it.  Kudos to Instant Pot for making a great product at such a reasonable price."
5.0 out of 5 stars,I used to use pressure cookers that I bought in India. This feels safe. I have made lentils soaked and dry and 16 minutes seem perfect for the way I like them. I have made potato cauliflower dish and it was perfect at 8 minutes. Red beans and garbanzo are best when they are soaked for 5 hours and then put in the Instapot for 16 minutes. I love it. Only thing is that I will cook something for 15 minutes and the timer shuts off but it will hold the steam for another 15 minutes which can seem a lit when you are in a rush so I am always releasing the pressure.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have a 6-quart, and decided to buy a 3-quart as I'm single, so sometimes want to make smaller batches.  This takes up less of my already-limited counter space.  Glad I bought it.  Use it more often than the 6-quart, most often to prep beans and other legumes for multiple uses."
1.0 out of 5 stars,Damaged product .. opened the box to find out the base had major damage and wouldn't hold firm on the countertop. Sounds like the product never went through a quality check.
5.0 out of 5 stars,Fantastic for cooking quick dinners using it as a pressure cooker and great for slow cooking too. My wife has always been somewhat scared of pressure cookers but she loves this one. The safety features and easy user interface make this a great addition to the kitchen and it's so versatile. I'd recommend the Instant Pot cookbook as a great add-on gift or just a gift for anyone that has this and are looking for more things to use it for. Very easy to clean as well!
5.0 out of 5 stars,"We are new to the whole Instapot concept.  My wife was skeptical at first but once she tried a few things, she loves it.  The product itself is awesome.  The only complaint she has had is the kearinginf curve on how to use it.  There are many books etc and once she received them she is in love with this.  Beans that took all day to cook now she can do in less than an hour.  Roasts, chickens, so many different things are able to be cooked so fast and die to the pressure cooking aspect everything comes out so tender and juicy.  Meats are permeated with what ever spices you add.  This is the best kitchen accessory I’ve ever purchased."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I finally got one of these and don't regret it.  We've had it for a month and make at least half of our meals in this because it is so fast and easy!  Also, cleaning is a breeze.  I would recommend if you use it often to buy an extra pot so you while something is cooking you can wash the other pot!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Everyone I know that owns this pot swears by  it, so I broke down and bought one. I cannot believe how great it is! we've done the pressure cooker feature, the slow cooker feature ( you have to buy the matching glass lid) and even cooked eggs in it. I have to say the meats in the pressure cooker feature are the best I've ever had. Done to perfection! You have to get this pot!!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"You see all those glowing, impossibly positive reviews?  THERE IS A REASON FOR THAT!  I love this thing.  We use it several times a week.  You can cook frozen chicken breasts in less time than it would usually take to defrost them using conventional means.  Brown half a pound of ground Italian sausage on saute mode; dump in half a box of pasta with a jar of sauce and mix in enough water to make sure the noodles are covered (hint: it's also about all you need to rinse out the jar); slap the lid on, close the vent, and set it to high pressure for 4 to 6 minutes on manual mode and BAM - DINNER IS DONE!  It's versatile and convenient.  I wasn't so sure about the price at first but it is so worth it.  I've even started buying them as gifts for loved ones."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is not your old pressure cooker.  We love this unit, and it can make meals in half the time or less.  We've made multiple chicken, pork, and beef recipes in it.  We even tried a baked ziti with meatballs, and it was a hit.  I think the most difficult thing is finding recipes that you like and experimenting with this unit to get them just right (as each pressure cooker can be a little different).Overall, this unit is easy to use, sturdy, and well-built.  The stainless steel pot is great too.  It cleans so easily in hot, soapy water.  Honestly, we've only tried maybe 10 to 15 different recipes, and all of them were hits.  The meats come out juicy as long as you don't overcook them so be sure to follow directions.We've had our Instant Pot for well over a year, and we still love it."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great product, fast shipping, great price. Absolutely best Amazon purchase ever. Extremely versatile from making yogurt, hard boiled eggs, frozen chicken to table in less than 15 minutes, making gravy, and so. Every kitchen should have one of these."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"The IP-DUO60 is such a crucial part of my kitchen now, I have been enjoying it for several months now and have not been disappointed with my purchase! So far I have had zero glitches with the digital inner system, and I have had no hardware troubles either.The delivery was on time, and the box and its contents were in great shape when I got them!I love using it to cook most of our meat now since I am able to just ""set it and forget it"" completely, and the meat comes out very tender (as long as I allow it to cook for enough time at a high enough pressure). The more I use it, the more I become familiar and comfortable with its many settings.One of very favorite functions is the yogurt making function!!! I have made batches in glass jars in the Instant Pot (sitting on the provided inner rack), and I have made batches directly in the pot and they have come out smooth, creamy, and just slightly tart! My husband and I often enjoy the yogurt with a bit of strawberry jam."
5.0 out of 5 stars,I bought this instant pot used and it came in perfect condition. Everything still wrapped just looked like it had been opened and returns. I absolutely LOVE my instant pot. The things that you can make is unbelievable. I just look up recipes and they come out great and so fast. Take some time to understand times but all the information is there.
3.0 out of 5 stars,"While I like that this has a stainless steel liner (as I dislike the old aluminum variety I discontinued using due to health reasons), after only two uses, one soup (with no acidic ingredient), the other rice, the bottom of the stainless pot has pits in it as one would expect in a low quality kitchen item.  Not knowing what it's lined with I may very well be down to an aluminum layer.  I want to exchange it but what's to say the next one won't pit?  It's very convenient for some things, other things not-so-much."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"could use a much better guide, ie temp setting in degrees, slow cooker is exactly that very slow..if using as pressure cooker remember time shown on cooker is time AFTER pressure is built..takes 20-30 minutes to heat and pressurize needs a much louder alarm/chime at cooking finish and warnings..overall an excellent purchase we use it often.. just needs a larger more detailed manual.."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"A modern classic that actually IS as good as advertised.  Shocking, I know.  Claim: perfect hard boiled eggs in 6 minutes (after coming to target temperature).  And they were - and are - every single time.  It’s a slow cooker, a steamer, a pressure cooker, a sterilizer and much, much more.  Got a miserably tough piece of beef?  Instant Pot to the rescue.  And, my favorite, you just program this thing, throw in the ingredients (and at least 2 cups of water/liquid) and walk away until it lets you know that dinners ready.  No supervision needed (nor possible)."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Bigger is better! I've had the 6qt for awhile and love it.  But, the 8qt can hold more than enough for our family of 5. I love the start without having to push a start button, I love the different pressure valve and that it's just as easy to use and clean as the smaller one.Only one decision left, which decal to buy to put on it and what to make next!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought one as a wedding gift, and liked the idea so much, I bought one for myself the next day.  Truthfully, I had seen this some time ago and had been considering a purchase.  I have a rice steamer, an egg cooker, a slow cooker, then bought a bigger one with a keep warm/timer/saute feature, and then I even bought a pressure cooker.  Since I had such an investment, I was loathed to spend more money.  I am glad I did.  So far, I have made hard boiled eggs in the pressure cooker; soup using the soup button (but first i seared the bacon and onions); chicken Parmesan; and a roast beef with potatoes and carrots in the slow cooker.  My husband used it to steam his vegetables.  Now I just have to psych myself up to give away all those other devices."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I was not sure about this. Saw it on Amazon Day Special and decided to buy it, mostly for it’s rice cooker function. OMG! What a great surprise! I used it every day for the first week. Soups, pasta, rice, meat stew, potatoes, and more. Different dish each day in just minutes. The only thing is that the cover/top is hard to hand wash. It is dishwasher safe. I sometimes need to hand wash it due to how often we use it."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased this on the advice of several friends who stated they absolutely love their Instant Pot. I ust made my first meal, beef stew, in it, and what a time saver! Also, the meal was absolutely delicious!! The meat was so tender you could cut it with a fork, but the veggies stayed firm (cooked JUST right). I am already looking for many more recipes and ways to use this amazing item! LOVE IT!"

Whatever you want to make, just google ""Instant Pot ...whatever"" and the recipes are out there. My old steamer died, and I'm probably not going to replace it. I haven't tried steamed rice in the IP yet, but it sounds like it will work just fine for that too. It won't work great for some things (Bread? No thank you), but that's fine."
1.0 out of 5 stars,"Doesn't work for slow cooking, cooked stew all day and it wasn't even cooked all the way. I hate absolutely hate it and want my old crackpot back."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I am so glad I did a little digging before I made my purchase. First, the shipment was same week and it was put in an extra strong shipping box so product was delivered without any issues. The instructions are easy to follow and the unit is easy to use. I've steamed vegetables, and cooked dry beans in like 20 mins which usually take 2 to 3 hrs.  It's so fast compared to regular cooking that I barely remember cooking, it feels like the food was home delivered! I suspect the more I use it the better my food will become and even become faster at it.  I do suggest that you clean the lid as soon as you can if you are cooking anything that has a smell, just so the rubber gasket doesn't take on the food smell.  If anything changes I will definitely update."
4.0 out of 5 stars,I purchased a 6 quarts I’m a family of three I may go up one and get the 8 quarts so I don’t recommend a 6 quart for a big family and less you’re going to do small things. Personal recommendation sometimes don’t go with recipe instructions do your own thing experiment that’s what I had to do
1.0 out of 5 stars,Don't let the brand name and the versatility of this product fool you.  It failed after 3 months of occasional use.  I could not return it through amazon.com. (Instant Pot doesn't offer an option to return through amazon.com.)  Spent much time on trying to return this item that was still under warranty.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"In my home, I have purchased three things I love the most Wall art for my daughter's room (I will never give it away because I love it so much), a picture of Holly Golightly by my desk, and THIS Pressure Cooker. Of course, this Pressure Cooker has paid for itself because of all the work that it does on a daily basis. I'm thinking of donating my pots and pans because I no longer want or need them. This is the best thing ever. It's so safe and easy to use. I make delightful dinners fast. I am able to cook beef without it turning into a puck. Fish tastes great in this thing. I have made Spanish paella, 9.5 lbs pernil, lasagna, countless pastas, lentils, beans...etc. in 60 minutes or less. What I like the most is that I don't have to fuss with tending to the food or anything! It's so easy. I'm a huge taster and it had gained me some 30 lbs.-well, ever since this has been in my kitchen I've lost 15 lbs. I don't need to taste anymore and dinner comes out great."
1.0 out of 5 stars,"Used this product for less than a month and it stopped working in the middle of fixing dinner.  But because it had been in hand over 30 days, I can't return it.  Tried to contact product support, no answer on the phone for 45 minutes before hanging up in disgust.  Sent email, received an auto generated case number but no solution."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is not the fanciest Instant Pot, but it's a great tool for me. Saute your aromatics on saute, then use either slow cook or pressure cooking to finish off the meal. You can turn on Keep Warm by itself for keeping a stew warm through a dinner, for instance, or turn it on so that when the meal is done cooking, it will stay warm until you're ready."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"When I was shopping, I was looking for the most possible options and cook modes.  For me, most are never going to get used (yogurt, I’m looking at you!).  It does what it says it will do.  Seems to do it well thus far.  The cook times do not seem to account for depressurization time, so keep that in mind if you are on a time limit.For the most part this seems to be a good machine.  I didn’t rate durability as I have used mine 3 times, and I have had it for only a month.  It seems very premature to be commenting on durability.It seems mostly well constructed, clear plastic cup for trying to gather excess water being a notable exception.  It is easy to clean, I wish the inner pot (what you cook in) had more substance.Better than my moms..."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have been using pressure cookers of different kinds for decades. A few weeks ago, my wife had one blow up on her and I decided to look into electric pressure cookers, finally deciding to buy the Instant Pot following the advice on this site and others.It has been but a week but I am so impressed with it that I have to let everyone know.Great things about the Instant Pot:- It is easy to clean. And it is very light (the part that you have to clean, that is). Regular pressure cookers are monstrosities that have to be lifted with two hands and what not to clean.- It is safe. Since the power is in control of the pot, there is no possibility that the pressure will rise to unsafe levels.- You can set the time and forget it: you don't have to hover around or reduce the heat after the desired pressure is reached.- There are lots of videos online.-  It is ridiculous how simple cooking becomes with Instant Pot.- It looks great on the counter.- Everything that food touches is stainless steel.- Interface is very simple.- You can release the pressure fast if you want: just place a wet towel on top of the steam release gizmo and release the steam."
5.0 out of 5 stars,This is by far the coolest thing thing that I have found in a long time to cook with. I bought these for all of my kids for Christmas last year and they loved them. My husband raves about my meals when I use this. The best part is dinner is ready in no time. The flavors of the meals are wonderful. I can not say enough good things about my Instapot. I love sautéing the food and then putting in the rest of the ingredients and wallah... Dinner is served. It is easy to clean up and light weight enough to take to a friend's house to prepare a meal.It has made my life so much easier at 4 pm in the afternoon when I am trying to conjure up an idea for dinner. Tons of great recipes on line.10 Insanely Easy and Delicious  Meals...[...]
4.0 out of 5 stars,The product itself is great. I gave it only 4 stars because of the lousy instructions (or lack of) that came with it. We had to buy another book to learn how to operate it.  Recipes alone don't help.
3.0 out of 5 stars,"I've found the crock pot feature takes considerably longer to work than a normal crockpot. I haven't found the perfect recipe for this tool yet. Artichokes cook very quickly in the pressure cooker. Next time, I think I'll try 10 minutes because it takes time for the device to decompress.On the positive side, it seems you cannot unlock it until the pressure inside is released keeping the user safe."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my second instant pot. I needed to upgrade to the 8 from a 6 qt since I'm typically feeding 9 people. The 8 does take longer to come to pressure then the 6 and a lot longer to release pressure HOWEVER, this has simplified my life in so many ways. I can put everything in and get other things done without having to stay in the kitchen constantly stirring and watching dinner. Forget to thaw your meat? Doesnt matter! you can still cook it in the instant pot! Dont have 5 hours to simmer chili or cook beans? Perfect! they are done in an hour in this magical contraption."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I use this device every week. I’ve boiled dozen eggs, made stew chicken, curry chicken, shrimp lo mein, meatballs, and steamed veggies. There’s really nothing I can’t make. The steel container is easy to clean and it doesn’t get too hot so I can still touch and move it. The 6 qt is able to make four plates of food at a time. If you need more than that, consider a larger size."
1.0 out of 5 stars,"So I just opened the package and there is NO manual, NO recipe book, and NO quick reference guide. Made in China. I shouldn't be surprised to be disappointed. I sure don't know how to use it. Want me to guess? They are kind enough to allow a printable manual. I guess I have to buy a computer and printer to use my Instant Pot. I hope they're not made in China. I won't know how to use them without a manual either. FYI: Customer service is horrible. Buy any other brand. Instant Pot is made in Chinese sweat shops and don't care if you get the promised manual or not.Cheap company. Cheap product."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great!  Arrived as expected in its own box and no damage.  I had an Instant Pot and gave it to my daughter hoping she will cook better meals for herself after work.  I missed having one so I purchased this one on Black Friday since the price was much lower.  My husband took it out tonight to prepare a meal and said he was glad I bought another one because he liked to cook with it.  Of all the kitchen cooking gadgets we have, I was not expecting him to appreciate this one so much.  Merry Christmas to You!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,and am so happy I did.  I LOVE this thing.  It cooked a whole chicken in 25 minutes!  Fall off the bone juicy and delicious!  I raved about it on my facebook page too.  I've made several different meals in it now and they've been quick and amazing.  Another meal was a butternut squash.  5 minutes and done.  I got the 8 quart because we're a big family and like to have leftovers.  I love the saute feature and love that the inner pot is all stainless steel.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"The shut off time doesn't actually turn off the pot as I had supposed it would.  Instead, after counting down, it comes to the end of the cycle and continues in a ""warming"" state and counts up.  But, we have had this pot for 5 years now and it works good.  We just have to use an external timer."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love my IP it is so easy to use and there are so many things you can make in this pot. I have found so many recipes I want to try. I made ribs, asparagus, and boiled eggs in about an hour. I am amazed how quick and evenly everything cooked."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"The Instant Pot DUO60 6 Qt 7-in-1 is  amazing. I had been pondering the idea of purchasing this for the last few years.  This product is easy to use and does come with instructions.  You don't have to get on line to find them.  It also comes with a recipe book.  I have cooked ribs in this pot that turned out great.  I have also cooked a whole ham that was one of the best I have cooked.  You can cook boiled eggs in it and they are actually easy to peel.  I don't have any negative things to add to this.  If you are thinking about buying, I would recommend this highly."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've used my Instapot four times, making a roast, a whole chicken, ribs, and chicken soup. Each time, the meals were easy and delicious. I haven't ventured into rice or deserts, but I'm having fun exploring new dinner options. I was worried about cleanup, but it's been really easy. The center pot lifts out and is easy to clean. The rest you just wipe down and dry for next time. This was a great buy, in my book."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Everything came packaged and in pristine condition. I was definitely intimidated by the instant pot at first, but after the first use it was pretty simple. It’s not as easy to clean as a crockpot because you have to take the lid apart and clean the parts separately, but it’s worth it because the food was delicious. I did try one slow cooker recipe and it came out as good as my crockpot’s version. The only difference is you can never get the crockpot’s high temperature. That being said I’ve used my IP weekly since I’ve receiced it and every recipe I’ve made turned out really well and flavorful. The meat is tender and delicious. I am very happy with my purchase and would dedinitely recommend the IP!"
1.0 out of 5 stars,"This product didn’t even last 18 months of moderate use before it started to implode. We’re lucky we saw it start to fail before it actually exploded and destroyed our home. I would never buy a similar product from this company ever again. Pressure cookers have been used deliberately to harm people. This one almost harmed us accidentally, while it was being used properly, according to the directions, exactly as we had many times before in 18 months, to make veggie broth, of all things. Do not buy this product."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Cooking every night for a family of 6 takes up a lot of space. We mainly use the Instant Pot for meal prepping tons of shredded pork and chicken. Cooks rice, pork, chicken and boiled eggs to perfection and quickly. The inner pot is of very high quality and easy to clean. The 8qt pot fits a de-boned 11lb pork shoulder with some veggies which is exactly what I was hoping for. Also easily fits 8 lbs of boneless skinless chickens breast and pumps out tender chicken that is easily shred in about 40 minutes."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have had other pressure cookers but I absolutely love this! It is so versatile and there are so many online and Facebook recipes for it. I use all the functions. I started with this first and bought the 8qt also. It is excellent and the food does cook faster and tastes better! I make everything from rice to stew/soup, roasts yogurt... You will live this."
1.0 out of 5 stars,"I would love to give this a five star rating, but it arrived today and the instant pot had a huge dent in the side. I asked to return it and expected that I would get a replacement. There is no opportunity to get another at the price advertised when I ordered it. It seems unfair that an item advertised is not replaced at the sale price if it arrives defective."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've used this several times now.Beef stew was fork tender in 30 minutes.Perfect ""hard boiled "" eggs in 6 minutes.Vegetable soup was warm all day!The saute feature doesn't get as hot as I would like and won't sear the meat and create the fond on the bottom of the pan to help develop flavor.I am thinking about adapting recipes for some of my touring musician friends so they can have fresh cooked food on the road! Instant pot is inspiring me!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I wasn't sure about buying this product. People told me how unsafe they were to use. I have not found that to be true. You just have to read the directions and it will tell your everything you need to know. It makes the the most tender moist food. Roast and chicken are awesome. I cook chicken ahead of time in the pot and freeze the chicken for making dinners such as chicken nachos, casseroles, tacos, white chicken chili, etc."
5.0 out of 5 stars,Very happy to finally get into the combination insta pot technology. Had to order a companion cookbook to help figure out how to navigate all the advantages. Many books but started with InstaPot specific recipes. Will order another rubber ring to keep spicy recipes not making another flavor in the yogurt. Look forward to using!
5.0 out of 5 stars,I used it to make pinto beans and chili..the mistake i made was adding too much water.. i am used to stovetop cooking and expected to lose some water.. so don't add too much water..the Instant Pot cooked the beans in 40 minutes soft and tender.. usually takes all day.. I first degassed the beans for 2 minutes using Manual setting.. then dumped that water.. this worked perfectly..don't add too much water in your recipes.. it doesn't cook off like stovetop cooking does.. that was my mistake..i look forward to using this more often I generally cook 3 to 4 times a week..I highly recommend this and the interior pot and seal go right in the dishwasher.. wash the interior pot top by hand..
5.0 out of 5 stars,"My wife had seen the larger versions at the store, we  didn't need a large unit. She checked Amazon, found the smaller pot and we bought it. It has been fantastic!! She has used it nearly every day since purchase making delicious meals (which I appreciate) using the pressure cooker, steamer & slow cooker. Works like a dream and is easy to clean."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Well! I am impressed! I used to cook up a storm with the old fashioned pressure cooker but since I'm not a fan of cooking for one, my meals consisted of ""90 seconds on high""...microwave meals. When I saw this on black Friday sale for $78 I figured now was a good time to give this a whirl. I just cooked beef stroganoff; sauteed the onions, garlic and meat in the cooker, added broth and Cabernet wine and let it do it's thing. I thickened it after it was done, added my sauteed mushrooms and sour cream and WOW! It came out absolutely delicious. Buttered noodles completed the meal. The only thing I wasn't a fan of, it the litle recipe book that came with it. But with the internet, that's sure not a problem these days!  This is a very highly rated cooker on consumer review site. Don't hesitate to buy this if you're in the market for an electric pressure cooker."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"So i bought this on sale, after a recommendation from a friend. I needed a new rice cooker and was lured by the multiple uses. I am not a big cook, and i read the instructions and watched several videos. I was a little worried because I've never owned a pressure cooker after there was an accident in my house when i was a little girl. Needless to say, i found this safe, easy to use, with several safeguards to prevent you from making a mistake and opening the pot at the wrong time. The first thing i made was a chicken broth, it was done in under an hour, it was clear and delicious. The veggies were not over cooked, which was also a concern. I've looked up recipes online and found the pot easy to use."
3.0 out of 5 stars,"I was very excited to get my instyapot. I made my first 2 meals and they were amazing! Excited the next week I tried for my 3rd insta-meal, to my horror 10 minutes in it compleatly lost power.I unplugged and let it sit for a bit thinking maybe it needed a break, plugged it back in and nothing, moved to another plug nothing.Disappointed I cleaned it and put it away, I have tryed a few times to plug it in but still no power to the appliance.I took the bottom off to see what I could see, and I was super disappointed to see a what seems to be a very sloppy adhesive job with the wording inside. I'm wondering if that was the reason. I contacted insta-pot with an email and pictures, hoping to get answers."
1.0 out of 5 stars,"I have used my Instant Pot four times. All which went according to plan. However, the fifth time, I was making a pot roast when the unit died. Even though I had already browned the meat and was ready to put it all together to use the pressure cooking feature, the unit quit. I have tried to unplug the cords, use a different outlet, to no avail.I'm hoping the warranty I purchased will take care of either the repair, replacement or money back."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"I really like the convenience of one pot cooking. I am one person so I chose this 3 quart size and it is just right. I'm not a good cook by any means which is why the chicken was a little over done. But the pot roast...... omg, loved it."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"My Instant Pot began malfunctioning after approximately 6 weeks.  It had issues sealing. venting and opening.  Due to my work and frequent travel schedule I attempted to get by cleaning frequently valves, seals, and reseating the pressure knob. After 4 months I went online registered my Instant Pot Duo Mini.  I created a support ticket online. Instant Pot support called. Sent a email asking me to perform test and also send pictures of equipment and proof of purchase.  I called back a couple days later to follow up.  They are sending me a brand new instant pot out..... free shipping.  ;) 🙌♥️😁"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love this thing! Who needs a slow cooker when you can have this1st time in years making yogurt at home and this is so easy and comes out greatso many recipes online, ideas, and I even have made some of my own dishes and of course I tweet many of the recipes for my own taste and/or for different serving sizes"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"We've had our insta pot now for several months. My husband was the first one to read through the manual and cook something in it. He made shredded chicken for tacos in it the first time he added 3 pounds a frozen chicken breast, 2 packages a hot taco seasoning, and covered it with water put the lid on it plugged in, pushed the meat button, walked away. 35 minutes later we had perfectly seasoned juicy chicken that fell apart we literally could not stick a fork in it enough to get it out of the pot. I had to use a slotted spoon because it was so tender it literally fell apart. Sure made it easy to perpare soft chicken tacos. This insta pot super simple to operate and clean. I have prepared many meals with my insta pot everything has turned out beautifully despite my apprehensiveness in using an electric pressure cooker. It is very well made easy to use and silent. The only noise it makes its just when you push the buttons and at the end of the cooking it rings a little tune to let you know that it's finished. You can turn it off and just let it sit it will depressurize on its own or you can use the vent button at the top to let the pressure off when the lid lock drops you can safely remove the lid. If you miss the done tune or are not home it automatically keep your food warm. I can't imagine anybody not being able to cook in this insta pot. We have three teenagers at home and I use this almost daily. My favorite thing to cook in my insta pot is anything with dry beans never again will I buy canned beans. when I make chili in my insta pot I add about 2 pounds of whatever kind of dry beans I'm going to use my onions and crumbled up raw ground beef, 2 packages of McCormick hot chili packets, and a large can of tomato sauce, I usually add another 2 cans or so of water and give it a good stir put the lid on it push the stew/soup button. I have made this several times and every time it has turned out beautifully with soft beans, perfectly tender juicy beef crumbles in a spicy tomato base. SO amazingly easy and it only takes 35 minutes."
3.0 out of 5 stars,"So far I've used this for rice cooking, sautéing, and pressure cooking since purchase in July. It's was great until I tried the slow cooking method yesterday. I discovered that the veggies in my lovely black bean soup were too firm after 4 hours on ""more"" (high). I reset it for another hour (5) but they were still undercooked. The chart in the manual claims that the temp should reach between 200 and 210 at that setting, but my cooking thermometer showed only 182. I double checked it today with a quart of plain water, and again, it read at 183. Then I tried it at low setting which should reach between 180 and 190;  that was acceptable since the water reached 183.  Looks like this thing won't go above that temp. The warranty is for a year, but their site indicates a 30 day window. Now what am I supposed to do?"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Having used a conventional pressure cooker for several years, the ability to program the Instant Pot is a great feature. No more having to double check the clock every few minutes, and the removable stainless liner is a bonus. Many people are still nervous, having heard all the 60 and 70 year old stories about exploding pressure cookers. I lived on my boat for 9 years and used one frequently (they're quite popular with live-aboard boaters). Anything I could do with my manual pressure cooker has been surpassed by the Instant Pot. I would recommend it highly."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"While this has cooked my rice perfectly, i am having trouble cooking anything else for the simple fact that the “instruction” booklet is fairly useless. Instead of clear instructions it’s written in paragraph form and not for any specific food. Ie: I’m attempting ribs. (Do I hit meat or manual pressure cook??) meat gives me 35 minutes, I don’t think that’s enough so I did “manual”. Now it says “burn” (that can’t be good!) I quickly look through the paperwork.. tells me nothing about “burn”. Seems like an important message but I’ll need to turn it off and maybe try google. Redo the manuals please."
5.0 out of 5 stars,I love this Instant Pot and have found numerous uses and recipes for it. The size is great for making yogurt from a whole gallon of milk and cook ahead bulk food to have ready made meals in the fridge/freezer.It's also fantastic for making my bread and pizza dough rise in half the time.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have a disease that makes me often not feel well, and that means that sometimes, we would eat takeout if there wasn't a way to cook food quickly and easily. I purchased this, figuring that we could use it to make quicker meals so that we could eat at home more often. I figured we might use it once or twice a week, and maybe I could use it for broths and bulk cooking. We use it WAY more often than I expected. We use it almost every day, sometimes twice a day. My husband discovered that he likes it too, and that has inspired him to cook! We use it for everything from hard cooked eggs (so much easier to peel!) to bone broth to dinner. This is definitely a worthwhile investment."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I waited a month to write this. I find this the easiest kitchen machine I have ever owned . Easiest rice, risotto, stew , bean soup, yogurt, plus plus. Very easy to clean and many Recipe books available on Amazon. Comes with easy instructions and recipes. This is perfect for family of 2-3 with leftovers for a friend if they happen to drop in ."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love love love the instant pot! Being a stay at home mom that is busy with young kiddos this is amazing. I'm able to make food frozen to cooked in such a short time. It's been great because I don't even have to thaw most items and can still completely cook meat in less time than my oven. The only thing I will say is misleading is that you might read you can make Hard boiled eggs in 5 minutes, which is true for the pressurized cook time, but there is still a period of a few minutes prior to cooking that the pot needs to come up to pressure so it does take a little longer to cook most things when you take into consideration the time it takes to ""pre-pressurize"" Either way it's still much quicker than conventional methods! highly recommend!"
2.0 out of 5 stars,I purchased the instapot over the summer and it had a couple uses in it. I tried to use it today and it wouldn't even turn on. Back to the crockpot.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"My sister got me onto this appliance and , it literally changes the way I cook! It is the most handy, easy thing to cook a dinner in an hour or less. The meat cooks fantastic for my pot roast, comes out tender after 45 minutes! Like, super tender! Since purchasing this, this is all we use to cook really. There's a great Chicken Wild Rice recipe online that tastes like a restaurant's, and it only takes me 45 minutes to make. Can't say enough about this product!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This thing is the best, I use it a couple times a week and it's surprisingly fun to look up new recipes and try them out. The hype is real and this lives up to it!"
4.0 out of 5 stars,"Does a good job as a slow cooker & pressure cooker, like that I can saute onions, etc in it before adding meat & veggies.  I bought this pot about 3 years ago.  One of the reasons I bought the Instant Pot was for pressure canning a small number of jars.  After researching, found out it isn't a safe canning device.  Research said something about temperature"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love this ""slow cooker"". My crock-pot broke, so I was searching for a replacement. I almost got another one but came across this. So happy I purchased it. I'm still trying to get the hang of all the features and ""timing"" for all the different recipes but overall I'm so very pleased. The sautee option is extremely impressing and helpful. After making pasta in 4.5 mins, I never looked back."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my third instapot given as a gift. Its a super deal when they are on sale, good space saver the many all in one functions. I use the slow cooker, braiser, rice and steam functions all the time. The others not so much. Its a breeze to cook dried beans for that perfect chilli. Rice and quinoa are lightening fast and meat is very simple. . There are tons of recipes on line and youtube videos for this. Enjoy and eat healthy. I have had this for 3 years and use it weekly with no problems, I bought an extra silicone seal just in case for 6 bucks but still haven't need it, the stainless steel pot is of solid construction everything else is working great."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Have had this for about a month, and have made 3 gallons of yogurt, chili with flaked pot roast and hamburger, pasta with meat sauce, shredded chicken, and steamed veggies.  When I get back from my next trip, I'm going to try making a cheesecake in it.  Great product!  Price can vary widely...$69.99 on Black Friday (which I missed), some days lists at $129.99, most days the price is set at $99.99.  It was listed one day for $79.99, which is what I spent because I doubted I would see it again at the Black Friday price before next year."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is by far the best purchase I have ever made. Takes a little bit to learn how to feel confident enough coming up with and putting your own recipes into the pot. But I have made some of the quickest best food in here for my partner and I. We load it up with food, cook it and are set with yummy meals for the week."
5.0 out of 5 stars,I have the small 3 qt and it has room to cook most anything for 2 people. It has all the features of the larger ones.  It takes a minute to get used to how to cook in it if you’re not used to how a pressure cooker works.
5.0 out of 5 stars,Love my new Instant pot!! My first try I followed the directions for the poultry… I did a turkey breast however it was not done I had to add 20 minutes to it because I pulled it out frozen solid and put in. My second try I added chicken broth instead of just plain water and added a whole bunch of different seasonings and my second try was much better and flavorful!!  Can't wait to make homemade soup.Very happy with my purchase!! Now I just need to get some more accessories for it!
5.0 out of 5 stars,"All I have to say is: WHY DIDN’T I BUY ONE OF THESE A LONG TIME AGO?! This thing is amazing. I have almost completely stopped cooking meals using my stove and oven. There’s countless delicious recipes for the instant pot on Pinterest. And it makes clean up a breeze. I am able to cook pot roast, stew, pastas, soups, etc in a fraction of the time. Some recipes may take experimentation but I’ve had very few mess ups with this thing."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This Instant Pot has changed my life!  I purchased it because I do not like using a crock pot. I would often forget to prepare food in the crock pot in the morning, also hated having to use a pan on the stove to brown meat before placing in the crock pot.  I was very skeptical about whether the Instant Pot would really cook so quick - it does!  I love that it is truly a ""one pot"" meal. The saute function allows you to saute your veggie and brown your meat. Roasts (beef pot roast, pork) are usually done in 40 min (longer if large) and the flavor does not taste washed out like with a crock pot.  I have prepared so many different dishes from recipes found on the internet. Curry's, roasts, vegetables, soups, beans, rice - really anything can be cooked in it in a quarter of time.  The rice function is magical - it knows how long to cook it to perfection!  Clean up is so easy, the internal metal pot(not a non stick surface that gets scratched off) washes up nicely and just a quick rinse of the lid is all  you need.  I soak the rubber seal to prevent it from getting smelly from certain meals, especially curry dishes.I am very happy with the Instant Pot as it has exceeded my expectations.  I definitely recommend it!!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have used this product several time a week.  Work flawlessly since I purchased it, thank you!This is the only pot I am using to cook meals at home and it is fast & convenience to prep a quick meal.I also have a defect pot with my purchase and vendor replaced it so fast with new one.Definitely I will come back to purchase product from same vendor."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have owned several crackpots and a couple of electric pressure cookers. My biggest complaints for both were that the Teflon coated interiors (pressure cooker) or glaze on the crackpots shells wore off quickly and made cleaning difficult. I had to replace them frequently. I bought the Instant Pot mainly because the interior is stainless steel. After using the slow cook and pressure cook functions, I LOVE this appliance! I slow cooked chicken breasts and the meat was flavorful and very moist. Chicken breasts in a crockpot always ended up a little dry. Then I slow cooked very lean grass fed beef stew meat with cranberries and a Dijon mustard sauce. I was afraid the meat would be very dry, as grass fed tends to be. Wow! It was very lean meat, but didn't end up like dry, stringy beef bites that you have to add a drink of something just to swallow. I am very excited to try out all the remaining functions on this beast!!!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,Definitely worth the money. It has so many features. Makes cooking more exciting and versatile. I enjoy my Instant Pot a lot. It would make a great Christmas gift!
5.0 out of 5 stars,"We just moved up the west coast and sold everything. For Christmas I got this and it's been the best present ever. It's nice that it's a slow cooker and a pressure cooker. So despite its size, it takes up have the space we'd need if we still had a slow cooker. It's size is also hardly bigger than the 6 QT...so if that matters to you, we found it worth it to get the larger (especially for making BIG batches of bone broth!)"
1.0 out of 5 stars,"For some reason, it just stopped turning on. On a very important day when I was cooking Thai Pho, 10 minutes after cooking it turned off. I thought maybe the breaker tripped. Tried 7 other outlets, nope. Other items plugged in so the IP itself was definitely dead. I've put in a ticket with support but still nothing."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I had the previous (first?) generation IP, and only used it a handful of times.With the additional settings available on this one, I've been using it two or three times a week. I now go out of my way to find pressure cooker recipes so I can take advantage of the time savings this device offers.The Saute mode is a little weak, even when on High. But it is still satisfactory - especially if the sauce that will accompany the meat is some variation on brown or red."
5.0 out of 5 stars,I use mine mostly for steaming various vegetables because I can walk away and work on something else and it will beep when ready (unlike having to watch over our unpredictable stovetop)  and I really like the creme brulee recipe that comes with it.Buy extra gaskets! You'll regret having just one when you want to make something with a delicate flavor after you used it for something strong smelling. We bought ours from the manufacturer when Amazon was out and the price was competitive.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Luv this thing.  Pot has thick bottom to allow sauteing really well.  Easy to use.  Lots of control over results via timers, ability to release steam early, sauteing at beginning and after pressure cooking.  Very advanced and safe.  Should be called Quick Pot, tho, since Instant is, well, not true."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Been wanting to get a pressure cooker for years, and finally bit the bullet for this after reading NomNomPaleo and dating a paleo manfriend. This is half the price of the stove top pressure cooker that I was wanting to get (yay!), does not require much attention- just put in ingredients, and walk away (unless you use the sautee function, but even that eliminates the hassle of cleaning up another pan), and does not heat up the house while it cooks! Used it to make bone broth twice, and both times it came out great! Now I get to have broth for days. Also love the keep warm function so that I don't need to make room in the fridge for the pot of soup. It is easy to use and there are plenty of recipes that uses the instant pot that I'm looking forward to trying out. Go ahead and get this if you've been on the fence about getting a pressure cooker! Super easy to use and easy to take apart and clean :)"
3.0 out of 5 stars,"We have only used this once, for rice.  There are NO detailed instructions anywhere for anything!  It took a bit of searching on the internet, and I still was not able to find detailed step by step instructions on what to do.In addition, the stainless steel tub was difficult to clean the rice off of."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have the 8 quart and love it but sometimes felt it was too large for certain things. I have used this to cook a small amount of beans that I have put into my chopped salad or burrito bowl. I no longer use canned beans for this,but the best part is that I can season the beans to my liking."
1.0 out of 5 stars,I was so dissapointed as the following were all missing from my order.  It also wasnt in a brown box it came in the instant pot box alone.
5.0 out of 5 stars,I've been looking at these for the last year or so.  Finally got one on Black Friday.It is important to make sure you use recipes that have been verified.  I tried one off the internet and the whole thing scorched because the recipe didn't include enough liquid.
5.0 out of 5 stars,I have loved my Instant Pot...but it died on me today...didn’t quite last 2 years.
5.0 out of 5 stars,This is a must have for that single person or senior parents. Makes small meal cooking easy and all in one pot. My mom loves hers and I love my large one. Read directions and practice for best results. Let’s remember pressure and steam here people!!!
5.0 out of 5 stars,So far I love the insta pot.  Even cheap cuts of meat are wonderful done in this pot .  Eggs are terrific.  I made vegetable soup in the pot and I don't even like vegetable soup but it was wonderful and I hate every bit.  I was scared at first but after cooking in it a few times I was okay with it.
1.0 out of 5 stars,"Product worked fine for about 5 months and then stopped working. I can't return due to the warranty running out. No matter which setting the pot is on, it won't cook. The pot will beep as if it's cooking but will then delay start and will switch to ""keep warm"" instead of cooking. I have attempted to get the pot to cook four times following the manual directions but it will not work at all and will only keep food ""warm"" instead of cooking it."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love it....Bought one for my daughter-in-law and one for me...including the extra pieces that make it even easier to use!!  So easy to use and quick, yet the food tastes like it's been slow cooked all day.  And, I bought the small one for me...perfect for just one person.  I'm eating more home-cooked meals now....easy & delicious!!!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,Everyone needs one of these.  I love how fast and easy it is to produce yummy food!!!  I soooooorecommend this product!!! and there are lots of yummy recipes online!!I can cook a frozen 3 lb roast in 1 1/2 hours from start to finish!!!!I even made chili one Sunday for Dinner.  And cooked the beans from scratch in my instant pot!!!  took 1 1/2 hours from the pot to the table!!  Chili is usually an all day event for me........So I am very pleased and highly recommend this pot!!
5.0 out of 5 stars,"The Instant Pot is really a good product.  I was hesitant at first, but once I found a friend to direct me, I was confident.  There are so many on-line groups that have members just like us who are willing to help.  I'd say ""go for it!""."
1.0 out of 5 stars,"I am new to writing reviews but I had to ensure I rang my bell for my own peace of mind. I used my instant pot, possibly 4 times before one day it just stopped working. I’ve tried different plugs, troubleshooted, called it names and received nothing. After looking through a few of the reviews it appears this is not a new issue with this appliance. Electrical issues always concern me but I now have an extra heavy Never Pot on my hands. Buyer beware electrical issues are always a concern and explains the great “deal” you can get for the unit,."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Absolutely In love. I bought a DUO Plus 60 and a DUO 80. I use them both all the time. They both do all the functions. One advantage to having two is that on the weekend I can be making dinner in the DUO 60, and in the DUO 80, I can be making a freezer meal for a few weeks down the road. My husband and I both travel and are busy a lot, so this is a huge advantage for us both. Now if I can only get him to realize that these Instant Pots are user-friendly, I would be in heaven."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is a fabulous addition to my kitchen equipment.  It is everything it claims to be.  I love getting a good meal on the table in 20 minutes.  Clean up is a dream as it is one pot.  I've ordered a couple of cook books for it, and it's great."
5.0 out of 5 stars,Use it on a regular basis as it is so easy and convenient to use.  Especially like it for cooking bone-in chicken.  It's fall of the bone after it's done.  Best appliance in the kitchen.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love cooking in my instant pot. I cook roast, beans, stews and vegetable dishes in it. I also have a larger one for when I have company. The only thing I haven’t tried is cooking dessert in it. Great for parties or get together where you need something simple and fast."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"When my slow cooker conked out, my husband convinced me to replace it with the Instant Pot.  His argument was that it could slow cook as well as cook rice and serve as a pressure cooker.  I was pretty skeptical, until I used it to make a pot roast.  It worked exceptionally well, cooking a rather tough piece of chuck roast until it was very tender.  We've only used the pressure cooker function, but have found that it's safe, easy to use, easy to clean, and maintains the temperature.  My fears about pressure cookers were laid to rest with the Instant Pot; no worries about it exploding."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"We have three meals a day at home with 3 boys... that is a lot of cooking.All food is cooked from scratch and we don't use a microwave.My wife does NOT like learning new gadgets, etc. A knife, etc. are great.That all being said... my wife LOVES the Instant Pot. It is fast, keeps the nutrition, can be set on a timer, etc.Very highly recommended.We like that the 8qt can hold bigger portions of soups, whole (small) turkey or chicken, etc. Better for us than the 6qt."
5.0 out of 5 stars,My wife just loves her instapot. She uses it almost every day to cook wonderful delicious meals in less time then conventional means. Her instaPot 8qt is the perfect size to cook entire family style meals. I would recommend getting one of the many InstaPot cookbooks that are readily available on Amazon to help find ideas one would have never have thought of before. Also there are many accessory sets available for all the different sizes of InstaPot cookers.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"What can I tell you. I have all 4 sizes (Mini, 6qt., 8qt., and 10qt, and use them regularly. I think that pretty soon I’ll be able to eliminate the use of the stove - except for fried eggs, lol."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love my Instant Pot! I use it almost weekly! It is a heaven send for so many things - hard boiled eggs, rice, soups, chili, beans, pulled pork, roasts, and many more. There are endless things you can cook in this! It is easy to use and get the hang of quickly. It is easy to clean. I have been using mine for over a year with no issues!"
1.0 out of 5 stars,I returned it. I needed something I could cook more in at a time. Also didn’t like tying up my only InstantPot with air frying. I’ll probably buy a separate air fryer eventually.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Instant pot is surely a time and effort saver. This mini size is perfect for everyday cooking for the family of husband, wife and 1 kid. But might not be enough when you have guests over. I prefer using my 6 QT when friends visit. But this on is good for everyday cooking!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"We've tried most of the features and had good success with all of them.  There are good websites and groups on social media for discussion of recipes, find your favorite.  Often recipes still require some prep, browning, etc., so this is not like dumping it in a crock pot only it cooks faster.  It will not replace our crockpot.  It does well with rice but if you need to make both rice and protein, you still need the rice maker.  We haven't tried it for yogurt yet, but it makes a lot, twice as much as a standard recipe.  For SCD yogurt, 24 hours is the usual recommendation in a standard yogurt maker, so I'll be doing more reading to see how it compares.  Makes great hard boiled eggs, not overcooked and easy to peel.  Proteins have come out well, and it does make the weeknights easier."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I meant to write a review sooner but was distracted. I'm a vegetarian, working on going vegan. Husband is a meat eater. Kids eat whatever you giveThem. This thing saves on time, money, and clean up. I'm making meat recipes I'd have never made before. And even though I don't like to deal w meat, it makes my life way easier. I make everything in this pot. Rice, vegetables, meat, yogurt, breakfast. It lives in my countertop. I use it sometimes more then once a day. It is absolutely the best small appliance I've ever purchased. If this one ever breaks I'll be buying another one. Buy this. You will not regret it."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm a monkey and everything I've cooked from attempt #1 has turned out incredible. If you're looking to cut down on cooking time, to cook a larger ratio of your meals than you go out to eat, and/or to cook in bulk, pick one up. You can search on YouTube for Instant Pot recipes specifically and watch people use the exact same one, which helped me make my first pot roast ever. Great investment."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"It's only been a week but I'm enjoying making soup, beans and eggs (which have never been better). It isn't an ""instant"" cook as it takes 15 or so mins to build-up pressure in the pot, but super easy to use. Love sautéing in the same pot that you cook in. I'm trying yogurt tomorrow. Look forward to cooking multiple dishes (stacked) at once. I thought it broke the first day, but the cord had slightly come loose from the unit. I moved the unit from outlet to outlet without realizing the issue was the other end of the plug."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love it!Update! After getting a chance to use this product more. I still love it. It works great with my instant pot (*Please not it doesn’t work with every instant pot but shows a list of ones it will work with) its user friendly, easy to clean, and simple to store."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I started with a small Insta Pot because there are just 2 of us. But I loved it so much, I graduated to the large pot. I love how fresh range free eggs cook to hard boil and the shells almost slide off! I make my own yogurt from raw milk, and enjoy quality the stores can not equal. I can make chicken broth, and then chicken soup by throwing a whole chicken in. So, so healthy!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"We got this as a wedding gift four months ago and it is definitely on the top of our list of favorite kitchen appliances. We love cooking chicken in it to add to other recipes because it makes meat so tender and moist. I also made peach pie filling in it once!Anyways, we love this because during the summer it doesn't heat up the house. The instant pot itself is very good qulaity and worth the price. The only thing I would subtract points for is that the pressure vent sometimes lears a bit at the beginning when the pressure is building, but then it stops so I don't know if that is supposed to happen or not."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This thing is amazing! I was so excited to receive it h and since I've had it for the week and a half I've made 8 things so far. 2 cakes, the egg bites, and dinners. Not only does this save me from cooking time. Every thing I've made in here has turned out perfectly cooked every time. I haven't used the yogurt function yet but I'm looking forward to that one too! There are so many things that you can make in a fraction of the time. I really wish I would have bought one sooner but figured I didnt need another kitchen appliance.  Boy was I wrong. Cant wait to make all the recipes I've already pinned on pinterest lol"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Instant Pots are great!  I use it several times a week.  I rarely use the slow cooker anymore.  There are features in here I haven’t used yet. The only drawback has been the money I spent on cookbooks so I can keep trying new dishes.  I think it’s wise to get a couple extra O rings.  The word INSTANT can be misleading but resulting meals from the Instant Pot are worthwhile.  The unit works well, clean up is easy and it’s indoired me to try a wide variety of new recipes."
5.0 out of 5 stars,Omg!  I bought this and then was too terrified to use it.  I FINALLY got it out Jan 1st.  We are in LOVE!!  We are eating gourmet meals every night and they are all natural and healthy.  All ingredients in one pot and easy clean up with just one dish.  I bought the Instant Loss Cookbook by Brittany Williams and I highly recommend it!!  The best recipes ever and all healthy and natural.  She lost 125 pounds in one year with Instant Pot and these recipes.  They are all delicious!
5.0 out of 5 stars,"One of the most versatile, easy to use cooking appliance I have ever used.Probably my favorite thing is being able to cook an entire meal in one pot, from start to finish.  Pot roast with potatoes, carrots and baby onions?  One pot.  New England clam chowder?  One pot.  Kahlua pork?  One pot.  You get the point...And it makes clean up a breeze.I've barely scratched the surface of what this thing can do, but so far I could not be happier.Did I mention what a great rice cooker it is?"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've been using the Instant Pot for nearly 2 weeks. So far I've effortlessly made... Black bean soup from dried beans, 2 pots of broccoli cheese soup, roast leg of lamb, yogurt, a pot full of perfectly fluffy-inside baked potatoes, steamed broccoli, and flan. My favorite feature of the instant pot, is that you can sear your roast before cooking and switching to pressure cook (in the same pot)! You can also saute the onions, garlic, etc. like you'd normally do before you make a pot of soup. It's much faster than the traditional stove-top method. It's great for me as I have a stocked pantry, but I'm not very good at planning what ingredients to put into a slow cooker in the morning. It's perfect. (It can be used as a slow cooker also, by the way :)"
1.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought Instant Pot with such high hopes. Most of the time, the thing would just not work. I wasn't given any codes or anything, it just wouldn't start, or would quit in the middle of the cook cycle. I would play around with it, trying to get it to work, but about 2\3 of the time when I used Instant Pot i had to finish cooking my food an alternative way.  Now, I tried to use it the other day, and I did get a code, so I guess the Pot has died. I paid a lot of money for this item, and I feel, in light of all the issues i have had with it, very cheated. Not to mention, I purchased this item more or less with a positive recommendation from Amazon. I am very unhappy."
2.0 out of 5 stars,After about 6 uses the IP consistently gives a signal that is it too hot. Often doesn’t seal. Contacted IP customer service..... a month later I received a reply. Pitiful.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I got the 3qt as my second IP and I love it. I’m using almost everyday. Great for smaller portions, there are only two people in this house. My 1st IP is a 6 qt, which I’ve had for 7 years and still works great."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love that I can make meals fast and with very little effort I can prepare tender moist roasts, chicken, pork chops, etc.  I have even cooked dried pinto beans with out soaking them first! They came out great. I always go to the internet for recipes and tips.  I bought one for my daughter in law and she loves using hers too."
1.0 out of 5 stars,"Hmmm. I own 2 other instant pots, the biggest and the middle size. This mini has a bad valve, won't hold pressure. Sending it back for another which will hopefully work since I hate returning stuff. Fingers crossed."
1.0 out of 5 stars,"I had high hopes for this item and was enormously disappointed by its performance. I tried using the slow cooker function and, for some reason, it did not cook the food thoroughly. I cooked beef stew on high for 8-9 hours, 3 hours longer than the recipe required, and the vegetables were still crunchy and the meat was nowhere near tender. Same thing occurred when I tried making spaghetti sauce.  When I returned it at Kohls the clerk recognized the brand and said that a lot of people were returning this item. I did not try any of the other functions (pressure cooker...)."
1.0 out of 5 stars,I love my instant pot. I use it all the time. I convinced 3 other people to get one. But now just over 2 years later the float valve will no longer pop up to lock it. I have tried cleaning this on the lid and the float but it seems to be a mechanical issue that is causing it not to come up. When you push up on the float it seems to catch on something and wont pop up?  I have tried to line up the float before locking the lid and then carefully putting it on but it still will not pop up. I am very disappointed but it seems I will now be forced to buy a new instant pot and since I have only had this for 2 years I will be looking for a new brand.
1.0 out of 5 stars,I purchased and returned. I tried a few recipes . The food turned out tasteless and not crispy. Also it is impossible to remove the top tiered stacking tray if you need to shake/stir.
5.0 out of 5 stars,We love the air fryer attachment for wings and fries and more! So many options to do now.
4.0 out of 5 stars,Nice product but depends on how much you will use it. We are using it sparingly but is working absolutely fine. It needs help with knowing the buttons and what needs to be done for what recipe but works.
3.0 out of 5 stars,"I loved my 6 quart Instant Pot so much that I had to buy an 8 quart. Well, I tried cooking a roast and the steam was coming out while cooking. See picture. Roast didn’t cook well. I will try it one more time. If it still has a leak I’ll be asking for another one or a refund. I did order ANOTHER 8 quart for a gift for my son.  I hope this new pot works. I truly love Instant Pots."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"It's pretty nifty. Great for transporting food for potlucks. It's good for making rice when you don't have time to sit there with it, and I've made yogurt with it twice now. Even when making yogurt, it's ok if you forget about the milk for a few hours when doing other things.I have managed to brown the bottom of the pot of rice when leaving it on ""warm"" for many, many hours.It does take longer to make rice in this pot than just making it on the stove, but the forget it feature means I can actually make rice when I have other things to do.I like and use the sautee feature often and again, the warming feature is great for potlucks."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great results as a Instant Pot Air Fryer. Use direct in the Instant Pot with 8"" Kabob skewers for a whole level of good food.Amazed at how little hot air actually vents into the kitchen.Results are outstanding and cleanup is easy.Great for two people with 6 Qt pot or just do multiple batches..Kabobs and fish n Chips my favorites.  OH! Did I mention NY Strip Steak???"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"If you don't have an instant pot, you need one!!!! I've had several buy their own after hearing about my own raving success! It's magic, I swear...all of a sudden I can cook things that make people ask for seconds (I've been a notoriously bad cook!), and it takes almost no time compared to conventional cooking, and things are tender and savory as if they've been in the crockpot all day, but I didn't have to get up at 4am to start it!! Worth every penny! I just bought a second lol!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"The Instant Pot looks a lot like a rice cooker, so I was expecting a similar build quality. Not so! The Instant Pot is a very solid unit. The stainless steel inner pot is heavy-gauge, and is as sturdy as any stove top cookware. It is easy to use, easy to clean (thank goodness), and produces amazing results. I have learned a lot from the YouTube channel, ""Pressure Luck.""2 recommendations: When sauteeing, a spatter guard is really handy. When doing a quick pressure release, holding a paper towel loosely over the valve minimizes spatter (if your recipe is very liquidy.)I am so glad I bought this device!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,Definately decreases meal prep time. Would be nice if pressure regulator settings were raised white letter (on black plastic background). Lifting rack is starting to rust after 2 dozen uses. Detatchable power cord or cord rack would also be nice to have (avoid the trip hazard).
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased this as a gift for my wife.  I have used it more than she has!!  The Instant Pot is fantastic.  I have used it to sear, saute, slow-cook, and pressure cook everything from rice to quality meats.  The multipurpose use of it suits almost every need I have in the kitchen.  I am a tech enthusiast, and the multiple options I have with this thing keep me finding new ways to use it.  I use it like a piece of tech, but result in great food at the end.  I am not very skilled in the kitchen, but have become more than adept at making good, wholesome meals for my family.  There are endless recipes out there for it for everyone.  I have listed my Pros and Cons below.  Do not hesitate to purchase this product.  I hope this review has helped you.PROS:Multi-purpose useSimple, easy to use button and display layoutDisplay notifications are easy to understandEasy to cleanEasy to storeCan use it on any surface, the bottom does not get very hot(however, I do use it on a cutting board as a precaution)Build quality is fantasticExtension cord is long enoughHas consistent cooking performanceSpatula / Spoon includedCons:Pressure cooking can be intimidating (follow the directions!)No tongs included (minor gripe)Extension cord is satisfactory, but could be about 6"" longer"
4.0 out of 5 stars,"The InstaPot itself is great. But Amazon’s packaging these days has just been...*face palm*.We received the pot, but it wasn’t shipped in a nondescript box. Literally just the InstaPot box with a shipping label on it. Two reasons why this is an issue: 1) even in the most decent neighborhoods, stealing packages is common especially when they can see the picture on the box (my neighbors could read the words ‘InstaPot’ from the street). 2) when items are supposed to be a gift, but now the person knows what the gift is because it wasn’t shipped in of a plain box. Maybe Amazon is trying to save cardboard? Eh."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I researched pressure cookers for months and finally settled on this one. I could not be happier with it. I've had it for a little over a month now and I've cooked things I never dreamed I could do. If you're on the fence about using one, I would strongly encourage you to take the leap. If you decide it's not for you, people have no trouble reselling them."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"The item in question is an exceptional addition to any kitchen. Since it was a Christmas gift for my son and daughter in law and I've not been to their home in some time (distant) I did not know that they already had one. As they've been out of town for two weeks, we have not had a chance to return the item and find something in exchange that will be pleasing to them. I truly wish that they had not had the very thing I thought would be a fabulous present because I felt totally inspired when I viewed the specs and saw how many different uses it could be put too.Oh well, I intend to plot out next year's gifts with greater cunning."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm loving this product so far! Makes cooking so much easier...I've use it to make soups, meats, stews, rice...you sauté the onions in the Instant Pot (has a sauté button), put all the rest of the ingredients inside, turn it on (go do something else) and after some minutes is done...so convenient!Just some facts to know:-it's pressure is a little lower than the regular stove pressure pan (so you have to add a few extra minutes to your recipes)-I seems like it also loses a little less liquid than the regular presure pan (so you might need to ajust your recipes)"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"LOVE MY 3qt instant pot. . Use my 3qt everyday  For those reviews saying their pot did  not turn on, it is 9 times out of 10, the plug at the pot itself is not seated, the plug that goes into the pot ,not your wall plug. I have helped a couple of my friends that said, my pot stopped  working, told them Push the plug in all the way. Worked fine.  PUSH POT PLUG INTO THE POT ALL THE WAY, loose connection the pot won’t work, then into your wall plug."
5.0 out of 5 stars,I needed to rely on YOUTUBE for tutorials and I never did go through the recommended testing and prepping of the machine...did not seem to make a difference.  Once understood how the machine works it was quite simple and easy to use. The learning curve was quick - again in part due to watching videos others had put on YOUTUBE
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Kind of amazing how easy and how well this thing works.  So far we've made a number of recipes from the slim recipe book that comes with it, and everything has turned out really well.  Nicely made, feels like it will last a long time, though with all of its newfangled electronic sensors and settings, only time will tell.  Easy to clean.  Our favorite so far is to cut a pork loin roast or thick chuck roast into 3-4 pieces, pour a big can of enchilada sauce (green for pork, red for beef) over the meat, and hit the 'meat/stew' button.  It automatically comes on and cooks for 30 minutes, and it's delicious.  Dump it in a tortilla, pour some of the sauce over it, a little cheese, and BAM!  Easy and delicious.  The old crock pot is heading for the next garage sale...this one's a keeper.  Very happy with this purchase."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Set it and forget it. If you have 30 minutes to an hour... You have access to some of the simplest, most tender and easy to make meals for your family. My 7 year Olds have said yes to everything I've made. From Moroccan lamb stew, to whole chicken in a pot soup! It is a families dream. Truly! We have the 6 quart which is just right, portion wise. And yes, it does take up a lot of counter space. Worth it!"

The instructions that come with it are basically a safety pamphlet and you have to go online for further instructions on doing anything more than air frying."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"ok, I bought one of these before when all my friends said it was so awesome.  I returned it though because it just looked too complicated.  Then I took a cooking class and the chef said that this was her all time fave kitchen gadget so I bought another one.  the learning curve is steeper than usual but it was totally worth actually learning how to use it! i have been using the heck out of it ever since.  i'm a busy mom working 50 hrs a week and this has been a serious life saver.  you must buy one of these and get rid of your regular slow cooker.  you won't be sorry!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"My instant pot is such a great addition to my kitchen.  I always thought it was a glorified crock pot, boy was I wrong.  So far I’ve cooked salmon and then ribs and both turned out perfect.  Great purchase."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I refuse to use Teflon or aluminum for cooking bc I know better! Stainless steel throughout, as it should be! I've been trying to get Costco to carry these for a year to no avail. Finally was alerted to a black Fri deal, thanks Amazon, & jumped on it. The large size is the way to go, especially when making soup, stew etc. I cook a whole 4 lb chicken in it as my 1st step for making chicken soup, 6 qt size likely wouldn't work for that. I highly recommend this!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is not your grandma's(or in my case, mother's) pressure cooker. I remember when Mom cooked a pot roast in her pressure cooker it made a hissing sound as the little cap released the pressure so you knew it was working. This electric cooker doesn't do that. It is really simple to operate, is quiet, and gets the job done. Normally I use it to cook chicken thighs and they are fall off the bone done in about 30 minutes, depending on how many you cook(I usually do 4 large thawed thighs at a time) The inner pot is easily removed and cleaned and there just couldn't be an easier way to cook. I've had it for about 2 months and use it 2 to 3 times a week, and absolutely recommend it without reservation."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This thing is amazing. The use you'll get depends on the effort you spend on trying out recipes. I've noticed that it didn't make my crock pot obsolete, but it did replace it for some functions. For instance, crock pot chili is superior (imo), to the point I won't make more in the pressure cooker. However, stews have been excellent in the pressure cooker, and the lower cook time means I won't bother with the slow cooker for those tasks anymore. Does a wonderful job cooking meat to the ""fall off the bone"" status, while still being moist."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I am a mom of 4, my husband and I both work full time and farm as well.  Needless to say we don't have a lot of free time and multitasking is key to our survival ;). This little appliance has been like an extra set of hands for the past year.  My favorite thing about it is that I can set it and then go do other things, I.e. feed the baby, help with homework, etc. And if I get sidetracked it just switches to the ""keep warm"" setting.  I bought one after a coworker friend recommended it.  I use it in place of pretty much everything I used to do on the stove top (rice, mashed potatoes, corn on the cob, etc.) And in place of my crock pot.  I did not receive anything in return for this review, I just really love this thing!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Acquired this item via Amazon this past March. I love my Instant Pot and the only way you'll ever get it away from me is to pry it out of my cold, dead hands.But seriously, I do love this tool. Really makes life easier since it automates much of the chore of cooking beans while greatly reducing the amount of attention and time required on the part of the human (or cat, if yours is somewhat talented and not too lazy.)  I'm looking forward to making my first yogurt soon, so I'm still in the learning-to-love phase of this relationship.Thanks Instant Pot folks for such a great product!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Already have (and love) the 6 Qt version.  This one does all the same things on a smaller scale. Perfect for a side dish, hard boiled eggs, rice, oatmeal, or any other thing your heart desires.  If you don't believe me, get yourself one! (Or two 😉)"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Absolutely love this thing. Had a cheaper brand before, which died after 2 years. This is so much better! Comes up to pressure very quickly, the cheap one I had took forever. This thing is huge too."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love my instant pot! It's my first pressure cooker, and I use it all the time. Most of the presets cook modes do the job with no adjustments needed. The yogurt function is also perfect for hot soaking beans before cooking. I recommend buying an extra gasket and scrubbing the lid multiple times beforehand if you're planning on making yogurt with this device; the silicone gasket absorbs flavors and smells and it's impossible to clean it sufficiently to keep the flavors from permeating the yogurt. For normal cooking this is not an issue; it only really affects yogurt making."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is a game changer!!! Im a single guy who likes home cooked meals, and while I havnt cooked anything exotic in it it will definitely cook faster and cook well! Training as a medicine resident, I dont always have the luxury of time, but I can toss in some stuff in and itll be ready when I get back from a quick shower! Home cooked food for the week!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Its a great item worth every penny.  Its very quite.  its very easy to use with only one touch.  Easy cleaning.  Food can be easily stored in the cooking internal steel pot. I thought it came wd Clear Glass lid too for slow cooking so I call the Customer service.  I received very good service.  But, I learned that it does not come wd that glass lid so that made me bit sad.  But, still I thinks its the best cooker and saves lot of time and power bill for great cooking."
4.0 out of 5 stars,Prepares a quick mail for two; clean-up is quick & easy.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Snagged this for $81 dollars for the 8 quart on sale. After using it, I would pay the current price of $129. Included cookbook leaves much to be desired, but there are tons of on line blogs, posts , Pinterest etc recipes. Super easy, and minimal effort for healthy , quick meals.  YouTube has some great tutorials for beginners to pressure cooking, like myself. I would buy again and would recommend. Makes a GREAT gift for a cook of any skill level."
1.0 out of 5 stars,"As an old fashioned appliance user, did not realize the same looking item, same name, same price was an older model.  I missed the key word identifier.  Cost me $18 to return to amazon, then extra $40 for one that was the right model, and a month’s wait for delivery.  Thought Amazon was making enough money that it could name its appliances simply, not to take in targets lite myself.  Very disgusted.  Am frequent buyer. Nuts."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"It works beautifully. Who knew I could have perfect ham and beans in one hour without soaking overnight?!A lot of handy features. I would definitely recommend, and have in fact, to everyone.Love that I can cook when I have time and have it stay warm until we are ready to eat."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is a great addition to your Insta-Pot without having to buy a fryer seperately. However there is one flaw in the way you cook chicken and fries. The mechanism is hard to use with the top and bottom of device. It needs handles to pull these out, its flimsy and hard to use with two seperate items."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I got this a few weeks ago and have used it for almost half my meals since then!  My Mom used to have a stove top pressure cooker that I was always afraid to use.  I didn't think I'd use this for much, but once you try it, you'll love the convenience of quick meals w/o spending all day in the kitchen. One of the best features of this pot is its Saute setting.  It gets really hot fast and works very well for quickly browning food prior to pressure cooking.  The steep pot means no splattered oil/butter out of the pan!  After browning, add your liquid or broth and de-glaze the bottom of pan before pressure cooking.  Wonderful w/easy pot cleanup afterwards!  I looked online for a pressure cooker recipe for Split Pea Soup, adapted my recipe to that information and technique and couldn't believe I got the same result in 1.5 hours as spending 4-6 hrs making it on the stove top!  The ""cook times"" you enter are very short (usually less than 30 mins), however, it does take 10-15 minutes to come up to pressure.  And add in another 15-20 minutes at the end for ""Natural Pressure Release"", if you're not using the ""Quick Release"".  I used Natural Pressure Release for the Split Pea Soup.  I love it!"
1.0 out of 5 stars,The first Instapot came with large dent (shipping box intact).  Second Instapot came with plastic handle broken ( shipping box intact).  This was a gift for my grandson who has multiple food allergies to prepare & simply his meals.  We have been waiting since Christmas for it only to have both arrive with damage!!  Very frustrating!
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I wanted to switch my primary carbohydrate from flour-based pasta to rice for weight loss and general health reasons. I would not have been able to do so without this little wonderful machine. Maybe it's a reflection on my cooking skill, but I could not have made the switch doing the traditional ""boil water add rice put a lid on"" method, because half the time the rice would stick, or would be overdone, or underdone. Rice was a pain in the butt without this thing.With it, rice could not be simpler. And I get perfect rice every single time. With essentially no effort at all."
5.0 out of 5 stars,Loved it. It doesn’t let out steam like my previous pressure cooker did while cooking. This makes it clean with food remaining where it is and not all over the place. Very easy to operate.The zero steam feature makes it energy efficient. Energy is used to just elevate the temperature and not convert water into vapor.
5.0 out of 5 stars,Fabulous kitchen appliance!  Wished I had purchased many years ago! Money well spent. Food is amazing and does exactly as advertised.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I am loving the instant pot! So far, I have made rice, quinoa, boiled eggs, yogurt, vegetable soup, wild mushroom soup, pumpkin turkey chili, potato stew, and a few other things I can't recall. Every time if I'm using a recipe, it comes out great! It takes just a little getting used to, but then you're off to the races. I was hesitant to buy the 6 QT size because I have a small kitchen, but I'm glad I did. While I never made so much food that the pot is filled to the top, I like having the flexibility if I do want to do some big batch cooking for guests, or to freeze."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I just simply love it! It cuts down on cooking time and the seasoning flavors permeate all the way through of whatever I cook! My husband and I are very happy with the purchase of our Instant Pot! ps. Chicken soup takes 8 to 10 minutes, compared to 30 to 60 minutes! WOW! Read the instructions for the proper position of the venting valve and you are good to go! And may I add, Amazon delivery time is just simply amazing 5-Stars to Amazon!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"We already own an 8 quart Insta Pot that has seen much use and cooked many enjoyable meals, We purchased the 3 quart for use in our camper and found out it is quite handy for fixing small prep meals in the house, the only downside I can see so far is I am afraid the wife will insist on buying a 2nd one for camper"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"We have been using the Instant Pot for quite a few months and we love it. It does it all and does it very well. The function that I thought would be the least useful has actually been the greatest delight, the Yogurt function! What a joy and its a no-brainer! Just set and forget! I'll never buy yogurt again. This kitchen device replaces almost everything! Chili with beans, wow, to die for! Chicken, rice, roast or ribs cook in record time and come out perfect each time. Use it as a slow-cooker or for a super fast steam pressure cooker with the confidence that your meal will be flawless. Even sautes! We are still trying new features. None have disappointed. Seven stars would not be too many! Look at them all but buy this one. We have not been compensated for this review."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have only just gotten this, so I may have to update my review, but I did a TON of research before deciding to buy this specific model. I am brand new to pressure cooking in an electric pressure cooker. I have canned in a manual pressure cooker, but never an electric one to cook in. I had watched several videos on youtube before I got it, so I was pretty familiar with it when it came. I pressure cooked some water, just so it would help me feel like it was completely clean. Then I made a pot roast... IN 45 MINUTES!!! And it really is tender and juicy!!! Amazing!!! Delicious. The Instant Pot seems very well built, it is extremely easy to use, and there are SO many different uses for it! Love that you can brown your meat and then cook it in whatever fashion that you wish to, all in the same pot."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love, love, love my Instant Pot! So far I've used it for making stew, back back ribs, and shoulder roast for pulled pork. Delicious every time. I don't have to worry about thawing meat out beforehand, which is a huge point for me. (I tend to forget until the last minute.) It's as simple as seasoning the meat, putting it in the Instant Pot (add veggies if you want) with a cup of water and/or apple cider vinegar, and setting the time to cook. The meat is falling off the bone in an hour or less, as if it had been on the grill for hours. Smothering it in BBQ sauce afterward and putting it in the oven for 5-10 minutes gives it a nice crispy glaze. **There are tons of YouTube videos to help you learn how to use your pot."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love my instant pot. Makes cooking so much faster and easier!! This cooks food in a fraction of the time that a slow cooker takes. My husband hated my slow coooker beef stew, but loves it in the instant pot! Just a word of caution—make sure the sealing ring is in tight because otherwise you will burn the bottom of the pot. It eventually comes off, but still.Amazon had great black Friday deals on this so I bought 3 as gifts!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,This is one of my beat purchases! A must have. This makes cooking great again. Cooks fast with an amazing flavor. Check out recipes from Amy + Jacky for ways to make sure your diner is cooked with perfection and bragging rights every time.I simply love it!!! Thank you!
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I came across it while shopping Prime day, and couldn't pass it up. It's one of those things you don't realize how much you REALLY NEED! We've done beef roasts, babyback ribs (that surprised me the most as I am a bbq  and smoker purist, or I used to be anyway) Have also made soups and stews. It's a little fussy to clean the lid, which I'll put up with due to the results of what I have cooked in it!"
4.0 out of 5 stars,"I've had this instant pot since December 2nd (3.5 months now) and it's an absolute game changer. From cooking meals in a very very short time to completely replacing my slow cooker. The operation of the unit itself is sublime and works as advertised.However, after use for sauteing pork for fried rice and ready for cleanup. (two months in of 1x a week use for meal prep) The inner pot is now stuck to the outer pot. I've had a ticket open now since the 12th of February and sent a follow up email today a month out.I'm taking 1 star off for the customer service time as it was advertised to have ""Best-in-class customer service with a team of dedicated, friendly and responsive support staff.""To their defense, It's worth noting that the turnaround, per the support disclaimer on their site read, to give them additional time(more than 24 hours) to answer tickets. I would've been alright with a follow up but hopefully if I ever have a full failure that they would be more prompt about their responses.Cliff Notes/Conclusion: Get this pressure cooker and hope it doesn't break."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I got on the bandwagon for the IP more than a year ago but held off writing the review to give a long-term perspective.I use this item at least once a week. It is great for soups, roasts, oatmeal, rice, salmon and more. I have had to replace the ring after a while because of natural wear. I'd suggest getting a couple of rings so that you can cook more than one dish a day easily without having to wash the ring and then turn it back for another session. In fact, having a couple around is a good idea since it can carry the flavor and odor for a bit until you leave it in the sun for a while.I recommend this product if you are looking to add to your ease of cooking. It's not perfect for every dish, but it will do great work on many."
1.0 out of 5 stars,"I am not a fan of the instant part for two reasons.First, the slow cooker function does not cook my food nearly as well as my previous slow cooker did. I tried to cook a red lentil stew for 8 hours on high and it never properly cooked the lentils. We ate crunchy lentil stew! The same thing happened with a sweet potato stew that normally takes 4 hours on my regular crock pot. I cooked it for more than 8 on the Instant pot and the sweet potatoes were never fully cooked. Crunchy sweet potato stew!Second, when I used the pressure cooker function to cook a red lentil chili, it took about 30 minutes to heat up and then another 10 minutes to cook. That's 40 minutes, which is about the same amount of time it would've taken me to cook it on the stove top. The worst part is that the instant pot doesn't tell me it will take 30 minutes to heat up, and has no countdown timer for heating up, so I was just waiting wondering when the cooking would start while my family got hungrier and hungrier. Hidden in the manual somewhere it says that heat-up time can take anywhere between 5-40 minutes... that is not instant!I'm returning it."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"We bought our first IP about a month ago.  I have never been someone who enjoyed cooking, but will say that's all changed with the IP.  I am obsessed with this thing.  I am cooking almost every single day and am really enjoying it.  I haven't tackled yogurt or desserts, etc., but am really happy with all the meals I've prepared.  My husband is in Heaven.  I purchased one for my sister as well and she's going crazy with hers too and she's a very good cook.  I have found the Instant Pot Community on Facebook to be very helpful with great tips and so many wonderful recipes.  I highly recommend this IP."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have had my 6 quart Instant Pot Duo for a couple of years and I just bought another one -- not to use both at the same time, but to have in case something happens to my first one! I have worried that my pot would become obsolete as Instant Pot upgrades and makes changes every few months. I have worried that if it broke I would not be able to get another just like it. It is perfect: perfect size, perfect functions. I use it five or six times a week for making full meals or baked beans or yogurt. We use it at home and we take it in our RV to Texas for the winter. Even my Chihuahua loves it! He sits at attention while it cooks, awaiting something tasty. We don't eat desserts or I would make cheesecake like everyone posts on Facebook. Best appliance ever!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is an incredibly versatile small kitchen appliance.  We use it several times a week.Full disclosure:  I first bought the 6-in-1, but passed that on to my adult son because, after joining several Instant Pot online discussion groups, I decided I wanted to make my own yogurt.  If you want to make your own yogurt (incredibly easy with this version!!!), buy the 7-in-1.  If you're not interested in yogurt, buy the 6-in-1.There are many great things to say about this product.  Making your own yogurt is incredibly simple with this.  The ability to saute and then pressure cook makes dinner after a long day a breeze.  Cooking beans without pre-soaking? No problem.  Longing for a rice cooker?  Buy this instead; it makes perfect rice and does so much more.One last thought:  We were without all of our major kitchen appliances for over six weeks due to a kitchen remodel.  This little appliance made the cooking part of that time period no problem.Quality-made.  Incredibly useful.  I'm so pleased that this is a part of my kitchen."
3.0 out of 5 stars,"Pretty much a pressure cooker for millennials; see: gadget.  It works fine, but received with a broken spot weld.  I opened a ticket with Instant Pot which promised a response within 72 hours.  10 days later I called and waited on hold for 15 minutes.  Got a boiler room who identified himself as ""James Anderson"" . Yup.  He said they were way behind on support, which doesn't say a lot for the product, and promised to expedite the ticket.  He also suggested I return it to Amazon - great sidestep.  In other words,  These things are breaking; we can't keep up; dump it on Amazon.  Take it for what it's worth."
5.0 out of 5 stars,We have a family if 9 and this was a MUST purchase for me. I have the higher end 8qt but I use this much more and just received it. Just be cautious that if you purchase this Amazon might take FOREVER to send this to you. If you can get it to make it to your house it’s worth it.
5.0 out of 5 stars,I'm not a big fan of buying the latest kitchen gadget but after seeing how quickly and how well this thing makes rice we decided to get one.  It has turned out to be really versatile for making all kinds of dishes quickly.  My wife and I really enjoy this.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love this thing. It's so versatile.  I found it because I wanted a slow cooker with a programmable start AND stop time. Wasn't even looking for a pressure cooker, so I had to learn about them before buying this.  Turns out that pressure cookers are nice tools.  I picked this one because it has that stainless steel insert. I've made tender brisket in 45 minutes.  It makes great baked beans in 40 minutes, without soaking the beans.  It's great for quickly cooking a bowl of new potatoes.  Steel cut oats come out great, although not much faster than stove top cooking, because you have to let the pressure out naturally (slowly).I bet I use this 2-3 times a week for various things.  Haven't tried the yogurt function yet, but plan on it someday."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great recipes and design, sized appropriately for a bachelor/bacherlorette making meals. I have made several roasts, stews, rice pilaf, and oatmeal with excellent results and they last me the better part of the week. Really appreciate the multiple modes and safety features. The unit itself is easy to clean with the inner pot and wiping down the lid and inner lining. It has replaced both my rice cooker and slow cooker. Would highly recommend."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I was a holdout because I thought, another appliance?! Who needs it! But was I ever surprised when I broke down and bought one. I purchased it because my slow cooker broke and the Pot was on sale so I jumped in. Very glad I did. Food is tender and easy to cook. As for speed of cooking, I'm not overly impressed but not disappointed either. As long as the food is good, I'm happy."
5.0 out of 5 stars,Use this at least 3 times a week and some weeks daily.  I work a 12 hour day.  It's nice to have a hot meal in an hour or so rather than wait for 2 or more.  I know it takes time to get up to pressure but you put your food in and its as simple as set and forget until the timer goes off.  Better than a crock pot although it has the capability of doing that work also.  Just buy an extra silicone ring.  It is true the ring does retain some odors even when washed but those don't transfer to what you are cooking.  It's an awesome and reliable product.  I have had one mid summer and it still works beautifully.  I bought a new one at Christmas as the old one is going to camp.
2.0 out of 5 stars,"I loved my Instant Pot. It was a major time and sanity saver and so versatile. But then, after just over a year of light to regular usage, the pot the food goes in sprung a leak in the middle of making a batch of broth. So my kitchen is covered in broth and the Instant Pot is now out of warranty. As it makes me nervous that the steel pot itself failed like that in such a short time, and I guess I'll be looking at other brands."
5.0 out of 5 stars,The instant pot is now famous. I bought this one because it uses less electricity and than the others. I am living off the grid using only solar panels for electricity. It's a great choice for those with limited power.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This thing is awe inspiring, and does the work of an all day crock pot simmer in an hour or less!  It makes stews and pot roast very well, and is AMAZING at making a quick stock.  There are ""haters"" of the electric pressure cooker -  it does have 20% less pressure than a stove top pressure cooker, but the average home cook really won't notice.  The browning option is nice, but since the surface area is small, I still prefer to brown and deglaze in a nice pan.  Works great for reducing the sauces/stew once cooked to concentrate flavor."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I absolutely LOVE this cooker!!  I did a lot of research first because ""do I really need another gadget??""  With all the positive reviews, I decided to take a chance on it.  It is so easy to use!  So far, I've made pressure cooked beef stew and Swiss steak, plus steamed green beans that all came out perfect.  There are a lot of videos and recipes on line for the Instant Pot.  It is the most versatile appliance, with being able to saute, steam, cook under pressure, use as a slow cooker or a rice cooker.  There are so many ways to use the pot, I can see myself using it every day.  I will especially enjoy using it in our RV.  This has become my most favorite cooking appliance."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm a busy, working mom who likes to cook healthy meals for my family. This instant pot has really helped me out. Before if I would forget to lay out frozen meat in the morning we basically had to order out or eat some other unhealthy meal. Now I can get home from work, throw a few items in the pot and in 30-60 minutes, we are eating. I did have to learn a few new recipes and make sure I have broth on hand but I love this instant pot."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"The thermal fuse at the bottom got blown and I connected with the customer service on its officer's website.The response was not such promptly, which last for around 2 weeks, but so satisfied--I got a new Ultra 60 as a replacement since the Duo Plus 60 were currently out of stock."
5.0 out of 5 stars,I love everything about it. The pressure cooker stays locked until all steam is released. Just make sure you open steam valve with an oven mitt because some steam releases then. I cook most of my meals in this now. Last night was spaghetti and meatballs and it came out great. The inner pot is so easy to clean. I just wipe out with a soapy sponge.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This was the only thing my wife really wanted for Christmas. I wasn't sure about it, but honestly, after seeing what it can do and in such a short amount of time, I'm almost as happy as my wife. We are both professional's who get home late and the thought of cooking tends to lead us to picking up dinner. However, this is amazing. A full course meal in less than 30 minutes in one pot. It goes beyond a Crock Pot (which was what I thought it was) and makes life so much easier."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"I was so excited to get my Instant Pot last year, so many friends and co-workers had one. And there was so many good recipes online it seemed I could use it every day. Then one night my Instant Pot lid became stuck in the locked position. I read all the trouble shooting suggestions in the manual and online. But it was clear my problem was not common, I could find nothing regarding the issue I had experienced. The lid and the rim of the pot had fused together from heat, not external (there was no other operating appliance or heat source nearby). But the real bad news was my one year warranty had expired exactly nine days before this incident happened. So, since I don't know what caused the failure I am only giving 3 stars for material quality, 2 stars for durability, but 5 stars because this product is versatile! And I will be putting another Instant Pot on my Christmas wish list."
3.0 out of 5 stars,Limited to very small quantity because 2nd tray is useless. The 2nd layer tray flips very easily and is hard to get placed correctly on tiny lip it sits on. Hard to lift out safely without it tipping.The lid functions as designed but only for extremely small quantities.
4.0 out of 5 stars,"This thing is cool. I made hard boiled eggs... Perfect and easy to peel. My wife made a four-hour stew in one hour and the meat was perfectly tender. I give it 4 stars because the build pressure phase adds time to what the expected cook time is. For example 5 minutes for hard boiled eggs is actually like 15 because if the pressure building phase. Overall, a very nice device to have in the kitchen."
3.0 out of 5 stars,"My wife loves her latest kitchen gadget.  She loves to cook.  She loves preparation time.  She just loves everything!  The best recipes are the most-complicated to her.  She has been selecting recipes from an Instant Pot cookbook since she got it.  It's perfect for a man who has a wife who is completely consumed by the babies.  Such a man may find himself called upon to pitch in and feed the growing family.  And what could be better that to come home from work and drop some nameless ingredients into a pot and wait two hours for a delicious dinner while the wife nurses the baby?  Nothing, I guess, except for a barbecue, a grill or a crockpot the doesn't try to do everything and be be-all-and-end-all for the busy person on the go."
5.0 out of 5 stars,I love my instapot! I've never used a pressure cooker or air fryer and this product was very user friendly and cooked everything perfectly. I made lentils using the pressure cooker top and fried oyster mushrooms in the air fryer and both came out great.
5.0 out of 5 stars,I abosolutely love this appliance!  I have had it for a couple weeks and I think there are only two evenings that I haven’t used it!  It’s unlimited uses are more evident every day.  I have made several Instant Pot recipes from cookbooks I’ve bought but I can also use my old pressure cooker recipes and the times work the same with this pot. I’ve already convince three friends and relatives to get one and they all love it too!  I would highly recommend this great instrument of the kitchen!!!!
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have been contemplating to get this for a long time. Many of my friends recommended it but I felt traditional pressure cooker is good enough for me initially. But with busy tiring weekdays making home meal on a working day is made so much easier with this instant pot.I got this and it is the best thing i invested for the kitchen.  All i have to do is plan my meal for the next day by adding it in to this pot the night before and make the delay start setting. It works like a charm, I wake up  drink my coffee in peace and just start fixing the lunch for my kid and spouse - done in  max of 20 minutes.However within one month the price has reduced from 95$ to 85$ . Wish I benefited from this price change as well."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Absolutely love love love this pressure cooker!  I've been using a stove top pressure cooker for many years for Indian style cooking.  It's the easiest way to make lentils, beans, rice, soups, etc.  I love this pressure cooker, and my stove top ones are not getting used anymore.  I am a soccer mom, who is home a few minutes, then leaving to drop one kid, then home for some time, and then dropping/picking up another kid.  Having this cooker has been so convenient, as I don't have to squeeze time for cooking.  I can set it with a timer, and not have to worry about it.  The only thing I've noticed after using it at least 4 times a week since I got it a month ago, is that it requires less water than what I'm used to with the stove top one.  So you will have to adjust your water measurement to a little less than what you're used to.I love that there is a saute function.  For Pulao/Biryani I use it to saute the onions and vegetables, before putting the rice and using the rice function."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I am a senior non-cook male who was suddenly faced with feeding myself after my wife passed away. The Instant Pot has been a marvelous help. With it I can cook meat (poultry, beef, pork), potatoes, carrots, corn all together with excellent results. Everything cooks to perfection within about 30-40 minutes. All I have to do is put the ingredients in the pot, push a button, and leave for about 30 minutes. Voila! Instant dinner. I have also cooked rice as a kind of breakfast porridge. No problem. Clean up is very easy. Construction appears solid (stainless steel pot). Would buy again without hesitation."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I must say it is an all-rounder and Life saver!! I am tired of cleaning dishes, messy stove top, also stading for hours in front of the burner. Luckily Instant pot saved my life. I am enjoying each and every moment in the kitchen. I tried almost all the recipes that I eat. Anyone can easily figure out how to operate it. I have been using this for almost 2 years. Zero issues so far. And I am ready to buy small version of it."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Still learning to use this because LEARNING CURVE, but when I follow the instructions to the letter, it works well!Update: Took this to an AirBnb and was able to salute carrots and onion before adding Costco roasted chicken carcass to make great slow cooked stew while at a 3-day music festival. Good times! I still haven't mastered gourmet stuff in this, but use it routinely for steel cut oats. Hint: you've gotta let it cool down before opening or the oats will spray to kingdom come and make a mess! It makes great rice as well. Definitely a good purchase and truly a multi-use item."
5.0 out of 5 stars,It is an Instant Pot! What more can I say -- I works! My family said that I should get one. I just could not justify the price for the use I thought that I would get out of it. I already have and use several stove top pressure cookers. I was work this thing is great. I do not have to watch it like my stove top units. I make my life easier. I am please.
4.0 out of 5 stars,"I LOVE my Instant Pot! Feeds my family of 5 much easier & faster now. I just wish the nonstick pot came automatically, not sold separately."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought the instant pot to make yogurt, and I made a lot of it! It's a bit fussy to make yogurt, with the straining of it, but it sure was a lot cheaper than buying it in the store! Then I started making dried garbanzo beans. OH HOW EASY! I put in a pound of beans, 8 cups fo water, set it for 40 minutes and come back when they're done. Love this!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I searched high and low for reviews on pressure cooking. And this one came up number one almost all the time. So I went with it. And I must say, I am VERY impressed. I love this thing. And I'm not very good with instructions. I was a little intimidated at first but there's so much help online and the manual is pretty good as well. Now the sups I make that took 4-6 hours cook in 25 minutes and turn out perfect every time! Just love it!!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"if you have inadequate a/c in your house, even one stove burner going in a small kitchen for a while can really heat the place up.  so if you want to cook beans from dry beans, for example garbonzos which take over an hour, put this in your basement in the instantpot.  its a miracle.  also great for long cooking grains like whole oats/oat groats.  wow.  my life is vastly improved."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Have been using my 6quart for a year now, love it so so much, got a 3quart recently because of the smaller size.  It’s good for everyday, mostly use it the sauté feature and pressure cook legumes.  Food cooks fast and no messy stovetop clean up, that’s what I like best...good idea to get more than one silicone ring, it tends to absorb odors."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I am retired and love cooking healthy goods. This is the best electric cooker I have had. This pot is terrific with pressure cooking and slow cooking. Very little steam escapes so all the nutrition stays inside.  Also very quiet for a pressure cooker! Quick release steam valve is noisy but that is expected.I am most impressed with the stateless steel pot. Safe and easy to clean. I make lots of soups and stews and this pot has been great for all of them. I boiled a dozen eggs last week and they all came out perfect.Now I am a vegetarian, so I have no idea how this is with meats. It was terrific with dried beans though. I couldn't be happier!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love it!! I have run the gamut on recipes in this appliance!! And it does it all in one pot!!! Even simple things are easier, i.e. boiled eggs! Hard cooked in five minutes (pressure cooked), and the shells come off with almost no effort at all!! Meats are tender and moist every time! Veggies are to perfection! Mine is on the counter all the time and used daily!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have always been a huge fan of crock pots and was a bit skeptical of the Instant Pot. Um, HELLO! Where have you been all my life?  Crock pot - in the back of the bottom cupboard. Instant Pot - prime real estate on my kitchen counter! I use this several times throughout the week.  I've really enjoyed not having to watch pots boiling over or wait for a crock pot to finish cooking.  The Instant Pot changed my kitchen!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Bought, and returned, the competing Cosori product twice due to construction issues. Wish I had started with the Instant Pot as it is better design, with better programming and more cooking options. The 3 Qt unit is a great portion size for two people. Thus far it has excelled at dried beans of various types, different rices, chili and split pea soup; all of which would have taken much longer, taken more attention, and involved more clean up, if done stove-top. My only, very minor, complaint is that the included recipe book is awful; there are much better versions of those recipes readily available online."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought the cheapo wal mart pressure cooker first... it broke after 3 uses... returned it and ordered this one... I've used it seriously almost every day since I've had it (had it for about 6 months now) and I just love it... everything comes out perfect.. I don't even soak my beans before cooking them in this and they come out perfect... when they're a little undercooked I just simmer for a little bit and it's like they've been presoaked and cooking for hours!  Makes perfect rice, even jasmine rice which I have always had a hard time with... and any cheap cut of meat comes out like prime cuts when cooked in this thing!  Makes the best chicken ever too... I just love it"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"For years I told everyone why my traditional pressure cookers were the best. They are top of the line great pressure cookers. But yesterday the Instapot was delivered and I made my first meal. Wow, so great! Today I'm making red lentil soup and then some zucchini recipe. Sooooo gooood! Thanks!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I used to make meals on a regular basis as a kid.  My wife is a great cook and aside from grilling, eggs, and grilled cheese, I am not a good cook.  With this device, I am in the regular dinner rotation.  I pull up a YouTube recipe and follow along.  After ten minutes to come up to pressure, the longest cook time I have had was six minutes (frozen fish).  Everything has been essentially perfectly done."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Since getting an air fryer would have meant more space that I really didn't have, creating this cover to transform my current instant pot into an air fryer + is a great solution.  Works good and looking forward to continue to explore the different cooking options provided with this lid."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"The CFO thought that this would be a waste of money, but as the COO I made the executive decision to buy this.  Boy, was the CFO wrong!  We use it all the time.  I have to tried to get her to admit that I was right but no luck so far!!Cooks beans type soup and lentil soup very well."
5.0 out of 5 stars,The wife really likes this cooker.  Provides a variety of cooking options.  Meats and vegetables always seem to come out tender and full of flavor.  A real time saver in the kitchen.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have already made 2 meals and both received 2 thumbs up. I made country style ribs with sauerkraut that normally takes 4 hours in the crock pot, cooked in 20 minutes in the instant pot, I used the saute button to bring back to a boil and cook my dumplings...food was perfect. First meal was a 2.5 pound pot roast that cooked in 40 minutes...again perfect taste and tender"
4.0 out of 5 stars,"Great product. Does as advertised after you finally learn how to use it. I don't think there are too many kitchen appliances or gadgets I haven't used or tried, but this one was a challenge to learn because the manual, quick sheet, and demo cookbook are all written for different models and do not coordinate well. Be prepared to do some extensive reading or watch youtube videos before you get comfortable using this product. Not exactly plug and play, but it is excellent in quality and easy to accessorize to fit any need or occasion."
5.0 out of 5 stars,I really like my Instant Pot and use it quite often for a variety of purposes. I like that it does not get hot on the outside while in use and that it has so many options. My only disappointment is that some times it can be a bit hard to clean. A spray of vegetable oil before use is a bit help.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Still learning all it can do, but so far does all it is expected to do. Great product. Get size suitable for family. Small size great for 2."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Got this on Prime Day for an incredible price.  I like it but it does take some getting used to.  You have to figure out on your own how to convert recipes on your own or go online and find help there.  I have used it to make beef stew, cheesy shrimp and grits, 13 bean ham soup, yogurt and spaghetti sauce.  I really like how fast it is, and the ease of clean up. You can saute right in this thing.  The silicone gasket absorbed the smell of the spicy foods I made, so I had to order a replacement to use with yogurt and desserts.  It really needs a more detailed instruction book and more recipes included. Overall, I really like it and am pleased with my purchase"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I am new to the Instant Pot but so far my husband and I agree it is worth it for the hardboiled eggs alone.  We have chickens so our eggs are very fresh and I have never been able to hardboil them without the white sticking to the shell.  I use the 5-5-5 method for eggs and they practically jump out of their shell.We have made rice, a few chicken dishes, and cheesecakes with excellent results.This product has a cult-like following and I can see why!  Very versatile, and I would not mind owning a second Instant Pot in the future."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I originally bought a no-name 3QT electric pressure cooker and realized how amazing this gadget is. I then bought the Instant Pot Duo 6QT and realized how much better the Instant Pot name brand is! Hence... I ended up buying the Instant Pot 3QT and giving away my no-name 3QT.Yes, I do use both the 6 and 3QTs multiple times a week. The 6QT is mostly for batch-cooking the meat or bean dishes and the 3QT I use ever other day for rice and sides. Highly recommended!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Avid cook, wanted a rice cooker and figured I'd go all out.  Makes rice perfect.  Also great french onion soup, great creme brulee, awesome lemon curd, and amazing sauces.  Cooks potatoes really quick as well.  Basically I use it for everything.Biggest benefits:Small footprintEasy to useReplaces several different appliancesEasy to cleanHonestly the clean thing is the nicest, my kitchen is cleaner and clean up after cooking is almost nonexistant."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"The Instant Pot is the real deal.  I must admit I was skeptical when I saw the infomercials for another brand on TV, but after buying I must say I am most impressed.  I have done chicken, ribs, roasts, and rice so far in my Instant Pot and ALL turned out fabulous in a VERY SHORT time....perfect for cooking a quick quality meal when you get home from work in evening.Seems well built and with the quality stainless pot insert you don't have to worry about teflon coating flaking.  I have found some foods stick worst than others (like rice), but after filling and soaking with soapy water it comes right out...so not a big deal for me.As far as recipes go, I haven't purchased any additional books.  The Instant Pot comes with a brief recipe book but I have found a plethora of recipes on the internet (YouTube and others in written form).  Don't put it off anymore like I did!  Buy an Instant Pot and enjoy!!!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This has changed our life! Just remodeled out kitchen with a new super oven etc. and now use it for warming. Eggs, potatoes. brown rice, quick meals, dishes of different kinds,many other things cook fantastic and unbeleivable. All my families and even some of my office staff has found the same thing.......omg! Way to go!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love my Instant Pot!  Received it for Christmas this year, and after spending a few hours looking up recipes and seeing what can be made with it, I'm sold!  I've made pasta, soup, and eggs, as well as steamed fish & veggies, sauteed meats & veggies.  Looking forward to making lasagna cheesecake.  Only issue so far was user error... not getting the lid on right.I highly recommend an Instant Pot for your kitchen counter (leave it out so it will get used).  Do plan on spending a little time seeing what it can do and setting aside recipes for future use.  Or when the urge strikes, Google Instant Pot recipes.Hint:  I also received an box of accessories with it, which have encouraged me to use it more.  But they aren't necessary to get great use out of it."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Very easy to use. More and more recipes are appearing with good instructions. Most important is to get the amount of time correct. Always remember it takes about 10 minutes for pressure to come up and start the cooking time. Depending on instructions to let the pressure come down naturally or release it manually, can add 5 to 10 minutes of cooking time. So if Ham & Beans take 27 minutes, add 10 minutes for pressure to come up and release pressure manually, it takes 37 minutes. Some recipes don't include the pressure up time nor the release method and time. Our food is very good when we cook it in the pressure cooker. The Instant Pot has performed flawlessly for us."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I don't know how I lived without this. BEST money I have spent for my kitchen!! I use it several times a week. I've made, chicken, pork, eggs for egg salad, rice, rice and more rice. No more burning rice! My young adult son and I share new recipes that are tried and true for our likes. He's into fit foods, so he likes that chicken isn't dry and I make a lot in here so we have leftovers. We've made some basic things and we're starting to branch out more now. Nice to just clean up one bowl."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Haven't used it. I have one just like it that was a gift.  It is great.  I ordered this one for my daughter as a gift, but she received one from her daughter on the same day.  I will return this new one for credit.  The instant pot works just like it says.  It is very fast, easy to use, clean, and you can cook practically anything in them.  I love mine."
3.0 out of 5 stars,"For the amount of money I paid, I wanted something more reliable. The first few times were great. But then it would malfunction when least expected. Soon, I stopped relying on it. Tried to look up reasons why it would not cook the food on certain times. Finally one day the pressure valve came off (pic), that’s when I understood. Now I have to figure out if this is fixable."
2.0 out of 5 stars,"These are very convenient for daily use, no doubt about it. But it stopped working 2 years in. An error code kept flashing when it was powered. I am out of warranty and had to buy another one. The only problem I have had is the long term usability of this product. If my second product breaks down after some use, I am never buying this again."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have been eyeing this item for MONTHS, almost a year before taking the leap. Literally there was a weekend where there was a special running, I couldn't say no and I'm so glad I didn't. This cuts cook time down to less than half the time. It is also as easy as it seems. The only thing is that I bought an 8 qt which is really big. I probably could have gotten away with a 6 qt...and I usually cook in bulk."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love, love, love!I treated myself to an instant pot and it was a great treat. I've read up on it a lot..(there's a learning curve) but it is easier than the pressure cooker I used to use on my stovetop! I've hard boiled eggs (easiest to peel ever), made spaghetti (all in one pot...even the noodles)! I've made a meatloaf and cooked chicken and new potatoes (at the same time). And I've made a rice pudding. All of these were really good. And I bought a stacking set and warmed leftovers... no microwave to kill the good stuff in your food!  There are tons of recipes on Pinterest and you tube .. both with great instructions. If you can follow directions, this shouldn't be hard.. get one!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I LOVE my instant pot! I have noticed a lot of negative comments but most issues seem to be user error. Read the manual on what you should or shouldn’t do (like not covering the valve release with a towel 🙄). Bought this for Black Friday and have used it 3-4 times per week since! Tougher roast meats come out perfect in a fraction of the time, frozen chicken comes out tender and juicy. I have not had one bad meal come out of this!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love this pot!! I only used twice since I bought it so I will update the review later. It came on time and there's no damage I saw. It is easy to use and does the job! I cooked Pork with manual pressure settings and came out great. I cooked black eye pea and Ham hocks today. This was more like my experiment since I didn't have pressure cooker recipe for this. I sautéed veggies then put all the ingredient and did manual setting for 25mins. Well I went out for about 3 hours. It was ready when I came home and everything was perfectly cooked. One pot dish!  Also, cleaning was a breeze which is very important for me with OCD tendency for cleaning. Anywho, I love it so far and I will try to use more and update the review."
5.0 out of 5 stars,I love this Instant Pot! Received it as promised and have made pork ribs and a small pot roast thus far. It's got plenty of space inside and I use the include wire stand inside along with either a Pyrex glass bowl or a medium size stainless steel mixing bowl depending on what I'm making. For ribs just use the wire stand and put the water level just below it and you're good to go. The unit is made in China for the Canadian company that designed it and it is really well made. The instruction book and recipe book are well written and contain a lot of information.
1.0 out of 5 stars,"Arrived in less than 24 hours - thanks Amazon!  HOWEVER, first time plugging it in and nearly all the lights flash, it beeps and has an error code.  Not working.  I tried refitting the lid, refitting the plug, a different outlet.  Nothing works.  I filled out the support ticket - let's see how long this takes.  I will update."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought this for my mother for Christmas last year.. and let me tell you.. IT'S AMAZING. You can literally make so many different meals in this thing its unreal. The best part is, it takes a fraction of the time of normal slow cookers and is so easy to clean. Our favorite meal so far has been beef tips and noodles in it. The meal comes out perfect every time due to the consistency of the machine and the meat is so gosh dang tender you won't believe it. There is also a huge following online with plenty of easy to follow recipes so you will never go without. Enjoy!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"At first, very intimidated.  But once I went through the ""first"" time use, I was hooked.  Ordered cookbooks, found easy recipes to start and discovered it was really easy.  Only had it a month, but use it every other day.  I know this summer, it will be used daily.  Meals that it seemed I used every pot in the kitchen and clean up took for ever, is now all in one pot.  Will not ever go back to cooking all day.  This was the best kept secret and now I am enjoying it.  My husband always worried about me cooking pasta and taking the boiling water across the kitchen to drain pasta.  Now I use the instant pot and there is no more draining the pasta.  All absorbed by the pasta.  Too many tricks to list."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm so in love with this Instant Pot. Beans, potatoes, meat.. you name it.. everything will be cooked FAST, and the result will be DELICIOUS! I've been spending way less time in the kitchen cooking thanks to this amazing appliance! Just yesterday I cooked rice in probably 8 minutes and corn on the cob in 2 MINUTES! It gives me more time to spend time with my family. Cleaning is also easy, you remove the interior of the instant pot, put some detergent with water, just let it soak for a couple minutes, and done! I can't wait to try more receipts with it!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"The appliance itself is great, I have never owned a rice cooker or a slow cooker, or pressure cooker, or whatever else this thing is considered. There was a bit of a learning curve to cooking in it, and although I have not been able to get the crisp burnt taste I enjoy from pan cooking, it does the job. For some things such as...welll cooking rice, it is great. It seems to be a good replacement for the aforementioned traditional cookers.The included rack that holds the food above the bottom of the pan is worthless, I would recommend buying a separate one, if and when you order it, you will see what I am saying.Other than that, no complaints."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I used my Instant Pot the moment it was delivered! We did the water test and that worked fine. Then we boiled some eggs for breakfast. Those only took 5 minutes to do! I made a beef stew last night and was very skeptical about it being done after only 35 minutes, but everything was cooked perfectly! I love the sauté feature, which allowed me to Brown the beef before closing things up. I can't wait to cook rice in it and see how that comes out."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"Made pork chops with sauerkraut, sauteed onion added sauerkraut, pork, seasonings and recommended broth/wine as fluid. Started up the pressure cooker option and waited. When I got the burn error, it said add more liquid. I did, still burn. and again. Finally i took everything out, cleaned the inner pot, put it all back in and started again. This time it worked. I guess I need more practice but so far I kind of miss my old stove top pressure cooker."
3.0 out of 5 stars,"This instant is not user friendly. Even when reading the book and trying to follow the instructions, I don't know if I am doing it right. I am not a technology person but...it is just hard to use. My friend has one also. Neither of us can figure out how to use the slow cooker feature. The pressure cooker I think I have down."
1.0 out of 5 stars,Did not accept my return doing Covid 19. It pictures a chicken which is the only reason I got it. It has nowhere near that capacity and is so small it doesn’t work for a family of three.Do the right thing and accept my return to to deceptive advertising.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Friends have been raving about this for awhile and the meals I've had from others were great.  I've only had it for a couple weeks, but it is so easy to use, fast and delicious meals.  Rice in 4 minutes VS 10-15 minutes in a normal rice cooker.  I've made ribs twice now that fell off the bone in 30 minutes, which included 5 minutes broiling afterwards w/ bbq sauce."
1.0 out of 5 stars,"This is a poorly manufactured product.  While the features and functionality are outstanding, the lack of quality control assures that it will break after 4-5 uses.  We are already on our 3rd lid, and it is the same pattern: after 4-5 uses, the lid displays ""Off"" and cannot be used.  Would not recommend.  Find something else."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This thing has worked great time and time again and saved a lot of work for big family meals or potlucks. Makes food taste amazing. Once in a great while, the pressure valve may not pop up in place and you just have to push down on the lid a bit after things have cooked up enough to build steam. Usually that's because I either added too little liquid or too much, but something to watch for. Make sure you clean your seal inside periodically."
5.0 out of 5 stars,I had an electric pressure cooker that was on its last leg so i decided to see what the instant was all about.  I don't cook anything crazy in it (yet) just the basics but I have been able to put my rice cooker and crockpot back in the cabinets because I can use this for everything now.  Definitely is a time saver the only 'tip' i would have is when looking at cooking time make note that does NOT include bringing to pressure and pressure release.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"For someone who has ALWAYS been afraid of pressure cookers and has NEVER used one, I am SO GLAD I made this purchase!!  What a versatile kitchen appliance and so easy to use!!  The first thing I tried was pulled pork for a church picnic - it was done in 45 minutes (rather than having to slow cook it in the heat of summer all day long).  I've done beans and other meats as well.  Will be using the slow cooker feature for soups this winter."
1.0 out of 5 stars,The instant pot arrived with the top and bottom black parts crooked and not safely attached to the main silver body. I didn't feel comfortable using it because it's a pressure cooker and the parts were not attached to each other properly. I contacted the Instant Pot support people via email and they just ran me in circles asking me to send the same pictures over and over until I gave up. Really disappointed in this company at this point.
3.0 out of 5 stars,"Its ok, all these super cooker reviews are overrated. Here is my opinion.1. It it a nice cooking device that feels well built.2. It does not jiggle and make a lot of noise.3. I think it is easy to clean and I like the removable cooking pot.4. Though I have not used the delayed cooking feature yet, I am looking forward to using it.The Cons1. much slower that my 12 quart stove top pressure cooker.2. I could not imagine trying to saute food in this thing, my stainless steel pans are much eaisier and do a better job. There is not enough surface area in the instant pot and you have to reach into the pot."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I was able to make a 4-lb pork roast in 40 minutes! And the saute feature makes it easy to thicken juices for very flavorful gravy right in the pot! This is much, much easier to clean than I thought. Everything that I have ever heard about the Instant Pot is true! I'm looking forward to many years of excellent meals from this staple appliance!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Makes those long hours waiting for beans drop down to 45 mins.... 12 mins for Pressure Cook ""Soaking"" (open it up and drain the water out refill it) then another 30 to cook them.  A crap load of rice only takes 7 mins...So within an hour I have 3 days of food... too  bad I found out about these things in my senior year of college... would have made it very easy not to skip class and wait for food to cook for the next days... I DONT DO FAST FOOD ..!!!Also no I am not a vegan....its just that beans and rice is cheap...like I said 3 days worth of food for $5... I DON'T DO FAST FOOD!!! I am poor but in the long run this pot will pay for itself because now I can buy food that I need to cook (which is almost always cheaper than pre made food) and cook it fast."
5.0 out of 5 stars,This instant pot is incredible. I was a little nervous to use a pressure cooker. It’s very easy to use. I’m not a cook but now that I have this I can’t wait to make dinner.. I love it. Right now Im Just using the basic function. I’ve made chicken and a meatloaf.  So easy.  It’s especially great on hot days when you don’t want to put an oven on.. can’t say enough. I love it..
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I am ever so glad this came into my life! It is simple to use and you can set and walk away to do other things. It is amazing how much cleaner my kitchen is without using so many other pots and pans to do the same thing. If I could take only one thing with me and leave my house, it would be the Instant Pot."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Bought as an open box deal on Black Friday. It came with a small dent in the outer box, but the product was perfect. I've used it a ton and have yet to ruin anything, in fact everything has turned out great. Just make sure the lid is put together properly prior to getting started.I've made a (damned good) roast with potatoes and gravy, chicken and dumplings, perfect hard boiled eggs, rice, veggies, frozen fish, poached chicken, fish/rice/veggie one pot meal, we did a crab boil. Everything has been great, quick and easy.I do think it takes a long time to come to pressure, so instant pot is a bit of a misnomer.I highly recommend this product."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I LOVE my Instant Pot and kicking myself for not getting one sooner!  6Qt was more than perfect size for my family of 5!  I use it at least 3 days a week, especially on nights with a lot of running.  I can make a great tasing meal in such a short amount of time and the food, whether meat or vegetables, are cooked PERFECT!  And desserts are so fast and easy, there’s no reason not to make a preach cobbler or cheesecakes at least weekly!  Love, love, LOVE it!!!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,I love this instant pot. The capacity is suitable for little family like mine. I cannot buy the little one in the stores which only sell big capacity ones. It works well.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I work all day and cook a=in the evening. Some nights I just want a break, and this little thing provides it. You can cook literally anything in the Instant Pot, my assistant, who recommended it to me, even cooks spaghetti in hers - throws all the ingredients in at once and cooks away. She says its fantastic, but all I know is that literally everything I have personally cooked in it has been awesome. Highly recommended."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"Missing Manual, Quick Reference Guide and Recipe Book.  Everything seems to be in working order but I can't cook anything yet because I don't have the manual and it would be nice to have the recipe book for suggestions.  I looked it up online for the manual and recipe book, which I found but it would have been nicer to have it in my hands vs. looking at it on my computer."
1.0 out of 5 stars,Customer support is nothing tgsy are trying to find ways to be out of warranty thank god that i didn't past the one month and i have returned never buy anything to instant pot
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love how quick and efficient it is. It has made dinner so much easier to prepare, I get excited to use it! It’s really easy to get the hang of the different functions and the pressure release. It’s easy to wash all the pieces and get it ready for the next time. I love that it came with a steamer rack and 2 different seals (one for savory dishes and the other for sweet) to separate the flavors from different dishes. I love my instant pot and I would highly recommend it to anyone!"
1.0 out of 5 stars,"I have been using my Bella 6 qt pressure cooker for almost a year and decided to go bigger. I've seen the all the IP hype on social media and wanted to jump on the band wagon. Well....so far not pleased. I've done the water test and everything and keep getting a ""burn"" message everytime it comes to pressure. Can's seem to get this message to go away and end up transfering everything into my old pressure cooker where the food cooks just fine. Not sure if its defective or what?"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Second one I bought. Use it all the time. I have to say that the newer DUO60 is a little more ruggedly built. The cord is thicker and can be removed. I have told dozens of people about this pot and know of at least 10 that have bought it. The price fluctuates so watch. Got new one on a special for $68 a few months ago. I really like that the insert it comes with is stainless steel without the coating. Don't be afraid of it, so easy to use. Get a good pressure cooker cookbook and start cooking. Easy. And you can donate your slow cooker cause this one does that too!"
4.0 out of 5 stars,"First order of Instant Pot Duo Nova 7-in-1, it was smashed doing shipment, but the replacement of it was easy without cost.  The second Instant Pot was great, I like using it. It reduces cooking time."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Easy to use ,versatile. For preparing Indian meals its fantastic - I have replaced my old pressure cooker with this. Pro- from cooking 1 pot meals to using my stacking utensils( The ones that come with traditional cookers)  and using idli plates. I ve tried it all.  I didnt buy any fancy stacking utensils that come with the  instant pot. Love that timer is set and I can come home to a hot meal.CONS- the rubber ring inside the lid does start smelling of the cooked food ( specially our indian spices) 2. things like rajma, chole taste dont get completely mushy because even in the pressure setting the steam isnt released  till the cooking is over ( like a traditional pressure cooker) So although the beans get cooked and taste ok but you dont get the ""over cooked beans- that make the yummy rajma"""
5.0 out of 5 stars,We had another brand of pressure cooker but my wife wanted a pot that was stainless steel so we ordered this on Black Friday and got additional discounts. Used it many  times since then. We gave our other cooker away and that person is very happy. We are very happy with this product so it was a win win situation. Thank you.
1.0 out of 5 stars,Every time I have used this product but once the burn indicator comes on.  It really prolongs the cook time.  I am really not satisfied with this unit.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"We have an instapot that is 8 QT... however, that is too big to clear and  comes handy only when there are guest at home... so decided to buy a small 3QT insta pot.We use this almost everyday for rice, pasta and quite a few other recipes. East to cook, clean and store. One of our best buys."
3.0 out of 5 stars,I’m only giving it 3 stars for now because I haven’t LOVED anything I’ve made in it. The roasts are not great and don’t compare to a crock pot roast. Ribs were ok. It left a weird taste or smell. Maybe once the newness wears off it will go away. I definitely wouldn’t care if it disappeared out of my kitchen so I wouldn’t feel like I had to use it. I feel like I need to give it a few more shots to see if it’s actually as great as people claim.
1.0 out of 5 stars,"Mine came without a condensation collector for the back. We can't use it until we get one. Unfortunately, I think I bought the extra part on Amazon for a regular size instapot and I need a mini. Not making my recipe again tonight... have to send this part back and try again for an accurate one. Sigh."
2.0 out of 5 stars,"I am still getting used to my Instant Pot, and so so far I don't understand what all of the hype is about. I generally use a Crock-Pot for chickens, roasts, stews, etc. Tried the IP instead and did not get the same tender, juicy, flavorful results. Even after cycling through recommended recipe TWICE. Meat was stringy, tough, and not willing to come off of the bone. Same with yogurt, had to cycle through the program twice.I did make tomato sauce in the IP (around 30 pints over 3 batches) and it turned out great. Much quicker than my traditional stove method. I did not use the IP to can the sauce, I used my canner. I will try the IP next for making applesauce."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"There’s a bit of a learning curve, but once you get the hang of it, it’s such a joy to use. I love my 3qt instant pot - it’s a perfect size for my household (2 people). Wish it came with more accessories (like an extra sealing ring for deserts) but overall great for the price."
2.0 out of 5 stars,"After a month, several of the buttons do not work. It is no longer fully functional."
5.0 out of 5 stars,We love our instapot and it has become at least a once per week feature in our kitchen. We have cooked a variety of meals with a variety of different ingredients. The food cooks fast and comes out very tasty. Highly recommend.
5.0 out of 5 stars,My first dish Beef Stew and it came out great.  Use the slow cook feature and it did what it was supposed to do.  Next time pressure cooking.
5.0 out of 5 stars,Puchhased this for my parents who are in their 90s. I thought they would use it once then return it to me. But... to my surprise they use it all the time and even gave me ideas of things to cook in it! I love my 6qt and they love their 3qt.
1.0 out of 5 stars,"The English language line could never get through. When I selected ""French"", someone answered the phone immediately.The pot broke down 5.5 years and they could not do anything about it. That is not important. The important thing was this company discriminated against English Speakers!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love using my Instant Pot. I use it mostly for cooking dry beans ( which I always soak first), rice, potatoes and beets. It is so fast and easy. I was confused about timing but found that the timing listed in JL Fields Vegan Pressure Cooking Book works out just fine. I found that the timing in the recipe books that came with the Instant Pot were too long for grains and beans. Anyone who is a vegan or who follows a Plant based whole food diet like my husband and I do should consider purchasing an Instant Pot."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I researched all types of pressures cookers and what sold me on this one was the quality of it's construction, ease of use and all the great reviews. Also the seemly infinite number of recipes that owners have submitted on pinterest and other social media. It is SIMPLE to use and you don't have to worry about burning your food or blowing your house up like you would with a stovetop model. If you forgot to set something out of the freezer for dinner, this unit can handle it frozen! What takes hours in a conventional or even convection oven takes minutes, hence the ""Instant"" in the name! I wish I would have had this long ago when raising our family! The time and work it saves is substantial!! Magical almost!!I highly recommend it and would buy it again!"
1.0 out of 5 stars,"This thing broke after 2 months, it was short lived, iam frustrated,...."
5.0 out of 5 stars,I have the 6 quart Insta pot for when I have company but this 3qt mini Insta pot is perfect for a single person!! I make everything in it from rice to soup’s.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Don’t want to remember life before my instant pot. I use it 4-5 days a week. Once you get the hang of the basics ( searing on the sauté setting before using pressure setting) , it’s easy . less pots to clean. And, if you forget to take something out of freezer, no problem. You can cook frozen meat. Love it!"
1.0 out of 5 stars,"Our pot is 3 months old and today it won't turn on. We've checked and changed outlets, pushed in and pulled out the cord, but nothing works.I did love the flavor and texture of meat cooked in the pot and was looking forward to our Cornish game hen having that special Instant Pot advantage."
5.0 out of 5 stars,Very easy to use and very fast. The range of things it cooks quickly and perfectly is impressive. It even makes perfect boiled eggs in 5 minutes.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I first received the GoWise for x-mas from my husband and after it scorched food on the bottom, wouldn't seal etc we gave up and sent it back. We bought this instant pot instead and boy what a difference! Right away you could tell the better quality! I use this almost daily now I love it so much! From rice pudding to pot roast, brownies to corn bread, lasagna to homemade hamburger helper this does everything! I'm even making my own organic yogurt now! Having gotten rid of our microwave for health reasons we also use this to reheat food and after a bit of a learning curve I rarely miss it. I can't recommend this appliance enough. Everyone should have one!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"LOVE, LOVE, LOVE my Instant Pot!  I am constantly raving about it to everyone.  I purchased this during the Amazon Black Friday sales and it has been the greatest electronic kitchen purchase of the year.  It defrosts frozen chicken thighs and cooks a great chicken dinner in about 25-30 minutes.  It also makes yummy steamed yams, sweet potatoes, squash, pumpkin, beets, and any other veggie so quickly.  Any kind of meat you put in it will come out moist and delicious.  I've even made an awesome peking duck and bbq ribs.  I love using this to make soup stocks in 1 hour that taste like it's been simmering all day.  My Crockpot hasn't seen the light of day since I've purchased this.  It's easy to clean and use.  So happy with this purchase!"
1.0 out of 5 stars,"Quit working on the first meal attempt, sent it back and was refunded my money"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"My wife loves this thing. I bought it for her for he birthday this year because she has wanted one for awhile. Cooks food super fast and easy. Makes great roasts and chicken. Cuts your cooking time dramatically.  Easy to clean just add water, a dot of soap , and a few teaspoons of vinegar.  Run the pot for about 2-5 min and all the burnt or stuck on stuff wipes right out!!"
4.0 out of 5 stars,I’m not very good with an instant pot. It’s been a learning experience. I don’t like wasting/ ruining food. I don’t like cooking meat in it. Not under pressure anyway. I still tend to roast in the oven or use my microwave. Every time I try and use this I’m frustrated by it. I can’t get the timing right to cook the food correctly.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have purchased two of these instant pot units so I can cook more than one dish at the same time. It is my new favorite kitchen appliance. I also purchased Fat Daddio 7x3 push pans that fit in these 6qt pots and made beautiful cheesecakes for the holidays. I enjoy cooking so much more and I do it in less time with my Instant Pots. I recommend purchasing additional silicone rings so you can swap out sweet and savory as the rings do absorb strong spicy scents. If you are still on the fence, you can add this to your wishlist and purchase it on sale at a later date. It occassionally goes on sale for around seventy dollars. It is worth every penny!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,I cook and bake a lot and I’m always updating and adding onto my kitchen gadgets. I cannot rave enough about this instant pot. I love it. I refuse to use any other pot when I need to cook meat. It’s so convenient and sooooo easy to clean. I love it. I wouldn’t change anything about it.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This not your grandmother's scary stovetop pressure cooker. It is safe and versatile. We do set to sauté to heat up more quickly and reduce the amount of time it takes to come up to pressure. We mostly manually pressure cook. There are so many free, helpful recipes and web sites available. Take advantage of them all. Cannot say enough good things about this cooker. Meats come out so moist and flavorful. Beans and chili are simple and delicious. Think green beans and new potatoes are a family favorite at our house. You really can make one-pot dinners in this little jewel."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I wanted a smaller pot for rice etc and this works wonderfully! I own the larger one, and this has the same features only baby sized :)"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm enjoying my instant pot so much. It makes meals so quick and easy for us. I can't get over the fact that my food comes out in 30 minutes tasting like its been cooking all day with the meat falling off the bone. I usually have such a hard time cooking meats because I can't tell when they are done, but with the instant pot, I follow the guide for how long to cook my food and it comes out perfect every time. This is an essential for every kitchen in my book. It easily replaces a Crockpot and could even replace a stove/oven/microwave if you are going the tiny house route! (I would keep a toaster oven for cookies though!)It can also be used as a slow cooker, for sautéing, and as a rice cooker.One of my favorite things is how dried beans come out in 30 minutes- perfectly cooked. I hate boiling them for hours on the stove, so no more of that!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is great. We have been using it a few times a week now and I can say it works well. It's taken some time to get used to the nuances of pressure cooking but we consistently have good tasting hot dinners with out a ton or time for watchful cooking and clean up.For a family with two busy working parents, this is a game changer.  We have noticed after a number of uses that the gasket gets a smell that lingers after even washing it but I feel this gets better with time and it's not a huge juice nice for me. When I first got this I had a hard time lining up the top to put it on and got a few scratches in the plastic on the top but this was totally user erred just pay attention to where the indicator markers are and it's easy as pie."
1.0 out of 5 stars,"About the second time I used my pot, I noticed a small dent in it.  I thought I dented it putting it in and out of my cabinet, but I later read reviews saying pots were dented when received.  Today, I used my pot for the fifth time and now have a huge dent in another spot of the pot.  I don't feel comfortable using it any more and will be trashing it."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"Great little pressure cooker.  Got this for the wife so she does not have to worry about using the one on the stove.  You can place the timer and leave it to cook from early morning to late night.  Cooks the food very well in a short amount of time and makes meat very moist and almost dripping off the bone.  Great addition to any cooks tools, and would highly recommend.  The only thing I did not like was the product took over a week to arrive, even with prime membership, not including the weekend."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This was bought as a gift. It is being used almost every day. It makes quick wholesome meals for 2 to 4 people tired from working all day, I recommend the hard cover cook book to go with it . there are many really simple recipes that make it even better. All functions are easy and functional for every day use.."
4.0 out of 5 stars,Loved the quick speed at which one can cook meals.  Healthy cooking.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is the BEST APPLIANCE EVER - IMHO better than a microwave oven!  Cooks meat to perfection: pot roast, ribs, BBQ you can cut with a fork - rice, potatoes, steamed veggies - all in 1/4 - 1/3 the time it traditionally takes - we are excited about all the possibilities - Pinterest is chock full of recipes!  If you have a large family (more than 4 people, you may want to go with the 8 qt model - but this one is perfect for 2-3 people with leftovers.)"
4.0 out of 5 stars,"The only reason I'm not giving this product 5 stars is that, as other writers have pointed out, the silicone seal this product is sold with holds on to strong odors FOREVER. This may not be a big problem for everyone, but I cook a lot of curry, chili and Mexican dishes. I am ordering a second seal to use for things like plain rice and yogurt. It would be nice if it already came with a spare. Other than that, I've been very happy with this cooker. It has eliminated several single-purpose kitchen gadgets, giving me much more cabinet space. I will be traveling cross country via RV shortly, and plan to use this machine almost every day.Lastly, the yogurt function is amazing! (As long as you don't use the same seal to make chili the day before)"
2.0 out of 5 stars,I have not used all the features of this unit simply because the lid is a terrible addition to this otherwise good cooking device. It does not latch easily and the when you are attempting to latch  it will ping warning sound until you semi get it right. The outer covering on the unit  comes off easily until the unit is stripped off its cover.  So disappointed and I don't think it can last in this condition.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This unit has a very nice array of features for time and money saving, packaged into one easy to use and elegant appliance. Modestly priced for this type of unit, fully functioning as described and advertised. The only detraction to this product is my own ignorance on the possible real-world figures on lifespan, and that in due time that will be surely made self-evident by the severity of wear it incurs during normal use within the factory specifications on operational parameters and tolerances. At such an advanced date in the future I will try to write an update, to serve as a helpful and easily understandable peer generated review."
3.0 out of 5 stars,"I like the ease of cooking with the Instant Pot. However, the silicon ring/seal on the lid absorbs the taste/smell of whatever you cook! All it took was one cook and nothing I do can clean it off. I don't think the only solution is to ""buy a new ring seal"". That seams a bit lazy and cheap of the developers to not think through."
4.0 out of 5 stars,I can pressure cook without burning !!!  ONLY thing I am not thrilled with is this is a MINI and the recipes are all for the bigger ones and I still am not comfy about how to cut them down.  They need recipes and basic instructions just for the MINI.  AND I wanted to buy the clear lid for slow cooking and they are constantly out of stock.  But all in all this is cool.  I gave it 4 stars because of the lack of specific recipes.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Got this during a flash sale and it was probably my best purchase in the whole year. I am disabled, with lots of fatigue problems, and this device makes it a lot easier to cook. One of my favorite easy things to do is steam a potato-- it takes 20 minutes and basically no work, then it's ready to eat. Also works great with rice, which I appreciate greatly. Here's a great recipe for buttery rice for anyone interested:1 cup rice1.5 cups water (maybe 1.25 cups depending)Use ""Rice"" button(Flavor with vegetable broth, 1tbsp butter, 1tsp heavy cream)"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Have been researching pressure cookers for past 2 years and trying to decide between stove top and electric.  Michele at Nom Nom Paleo blog raved and raved about her Insta-Pot. I rave and rave about her recipes!  So when I got her email on Black Friday about the sale, I couldn't resist.  In short, it's the best kitchen purchase we have made in past decade, hands down!!  Tested it out the first day with recipe for Ginger butternut squash soup.  From prep to completion was 32 minutes.  32 MINUTES!!  For creamy, velvety, delicious and extremely flavorful soup.  It took us longer to prep the ingredients than it did to cook.  Next up, black beans with no soaking.  WOW!  O.k. here was the real test:  grass-finished braised beef short ribs....From prep to being devoured in under an hour.  Normally, it's 3+ hours of braising in the oven. Loved that I could brown in the same pot and not have to transfer.  The meat was tender, juicy and trying to fall off the bone.  The broth had the most intense, rich beef flavor and the root vegetables that we added in the last 7 minutes just burst with color and sweetness.  Do yourself a favor and buy this device.  While we love our Le Creuset and de Bier pans, we have been cooking with this at least twice a week since acquiring.  Today, traditional New Year's day Hop'in John in under 30 minutes from prep to table, normally 2 hours.  I've never seen black eye peas retain their beautiful tan color nor the diced carrot be so brightly colored after cooking.  The meat had fallen off the smoked ham hock and aside from thyme and bay leaf, no other spice was needed.  Family raved that it was the best ever. Thank you Michele and thank you Insta-Pot for making such a fantastic tool.  Will help me keep our resolution of cooking at home at least 4 nights a week for 2017.  Oh, and I bought one for son and daughter in love as Christmas present.  They have cooked 2 meals in under a week and are in love with it too.  Excited about how much money it will save them this year."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Growing up in an Indian household, I was probably born while the whistle was going off on our stove top pressure cooker.I have it all, Hawkins, Prestige, Rice cooker, slow cooker, Handi style cooker, the traditional stove top.I have the ultra small size, couple of mediums, 2 large ones. So, in all I have replaced 11 equipment's with this 1. Some have the cooker rings broken, some whistles are mismatched, some handles are loose. And a very annoying stove top feature, is all that steam, with liquids from the cooker all over the stove-top. No more!As for all the Indian dishes, I make rice, pulav, daal, sambhar, chole, rajma, sabji's, chicken curry. I do the ""tadka"" with the sauté feature and then load the rice/daal/vegetables and then hit the ""rice"", or ""beans"" setting.I cook it all in there, come home from work load the cooker and done. Dinner is served. Clean-up is super easy (1 pot).I have used it every day since Dec 2015. We don't eat out that often anyway and with this one, set it and forget it.Updating with Fav Recipe: Pulav:Its a simple Rice & Vegetable dish (optional egg) - ready in less than 15 mins. Basically - use the Sautee button (without lid), add oil, ginger, garlic, onions, mix frozen vegetables (carrots, French beans, lima beans etc), add some turmeric, salt, all spice, whole cloves, bay leaf, black pepper (whole or crushed), cinnamon, add the washed & uncooked rice (2 cups of rice serves 2-3 people, 3 cups rice services 3-4). Add water and 3-4 whole eggs (with shell on) set to Rice setting. After 12 quick mins, once the pot cools off or you release pressure, open lid - add chopped mint & cilantro or basil. Remove the whole eggs, peel the shells off and there you have it.You can substitute with Brown rice, however, remember to use the ""Multi-grain button"", that will take 40 mins.This is my go-to recipe for those days when I am exhausted from work!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,I bought two of this product because it’s really useful.  It saves me a lot of time on cooking and maintains the deliciousness.  I thought it was dangerous to use but found it very wrong. All I have to do is read the manual carefully and follow the instructions.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought 2 of these for Christmas.. one for me and one for a friend.  I love it!  I played with it yesterday, cooking 5 different recipes. (I also got Bob Warden's GREAT FOOD FAST, which all the recipes came out of and I think they were very yummy! I didn't think any of the recipes from the cookbook that came with the Instant Pot looked or sounded good, so definitely recommend you buy a separate pressure cooker cookbook of some kind) I made French Onion Soup, Buffalo Chicken Wings, Apple Raisin Croissant Bread Pudding, Mac and Cheese and a Pulled Pork recipe.  I was trying to do a variety of things to test the pressure cooker out and to learn how to use it b/c it looks a bit intimidating, but it was so easy to learn.  Everything tasted great and I got lots of compliments from the husband and kids.  The pot is easily cleanable too.  I am going to get a lot of use from this and am SO PLEASED!!!!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,Seriously who knew? who knew you could cook a brisket in a half hour and the meat will be falling apart? I didn't! I got this for my gf for a Christmas gift for the house. She makes me wonderful food and loves it because its so easy! She loves cooking but hates the time and her body is not able to handle standing for long so this really brings back something she likes and the magic way :P Has anyone not gotten an instapot yet? seriously! go to the store!
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Bought it for use while travelling with kids. Have been using it regularly at home as well. Yogurt making is great. If something has to be sauted and then pressure cooked later, i advice that you let the instant pot cool down for few minutes after saute before turning on pressure cook. The instant pot signalled “burn” on its display if we didn’t let it cool down before pressure cook mode."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"A pressure cooker doubles the pressure and thus raises the temperature at which the food is cooked.  Also, it is a moist environment (steam), instead of a dry environment like an oven.  E.g., carrots, pumpkins, butternut squash, parsnips, when cooked with a little bit of baking soda, will be deeply caramelized, great as a soup base. Since this is electric, can make stew in 1/3 the time without having to stand over the stove or use a separate timer.  This size is great for making large batches.  Read Modernist Cuisine (either book or web) or watch some videos before buying or using."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love how there are several different modes that can be used.  It actually does what it claims and it does it very well.  The only thing I would complain about and it's very minor, is that this unit tends to cook way too fast.  Other than that, I'm very pleased with it and to think I bought this for something like 49.95 or somewhere in that area on Amazon's special sale and Target is selling the exact same unit for 99.95!!!  Every time I go to Target to p/u small items I smile...when I see their ""sale"" $99.95  lol..."
1.0 out of 5 stars,"I received the Instant Pot Duo Mini 3 Qt 7-in-1 Multi- Use Programmable Pressure Cooker... on December 22, 2017.  It quit completely working for me January 1, 2018.  I used it the total of 3 times.  The fourth time, completely dead.  I unplugged it and left it alone for over an hour hoping it would reset itself.  Nope.  I tried a different electrical socket.  Nope.  Dead as a doorknob.  I really wanted this product, as it was a Christmas gift to myself. Oh well,  I hope I won't run into problems returning.  The three times I used it, it worked great.UPDATE:  Received a replacement for this Instant Pot. Second time is the charm?  NOPE. The same exact thing happened again.  Ingredients in the pot. Lid locked. Plugged in.  Go to punch in the settings.  Hmm?  Nothing is lit. Maybe I... No it's plugged in.  Well I be. The same exact thing happened. Well, this time it lasted 2 months.  Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice,  shame on me.  Instant Pot - NEVER AGAIN.  In my opinion, this is  JUNK."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Just had to have it, even got the stickers with all the timers put it in the cabinet because it is kind a bulky it’s nice,  Said I would use it. I have had it for around eight months now and guess what it is still in the cabinet I haven’t used it yet.... “BUT I GOT IT!!”"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Omg, thank you Prime Day! Everybody InstaPot your meals. I don’t think it reduced my cook tome but it definitely reduced the amount I had to stir and watch the food cook to make sure it didn’t burn. Plus you don’t hear up your home with turning on stove or oven"
4.0 out of 5 stars,"So far so good. I've used it to make chicken breasts, shredded chicken, whole chicken, corned beef, oxtails and bone broth. I notice the last time I used it on the soup setting, the steam was coming out from all sides of the lid. It was set to sealing. After depressurizing it and adjusting the seal it seems to have fixed that. I hope the seal in the lid is not warping already. I have only hand washed the parts so far."
5.0 out of 5 stars,I love this instapot. I've used it for everything. I cooked oxtails a few days ago the meat literally fell from the bone.I do recommend being very careful when releasing the steam. The valve is really loose. My first time closing lid was a little difficult but I finally got it.Features are easy to use storage is no problem.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've made roasts, brisket, soups, stews, baked chicken, potatoes, rice and gravy and I'm sure more that I can't remember. It perfomed beautifully for all tasks, including browning onions and searing roasts. All meats I've made have been fall-off-the-bone tender. Also, extemely easy to clean, even day old gravy came right off. I'd buy this again and again."
5.0 out of 5 stars,Love the cake and sanitize functions that come with this model.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've made several recipes using different meats. Each one turned out great. Ground beef (Swedish meatballs and beef stronganoff), chicken with jasmine rice, and chicken piccata. Just be sure you follow directions exactly and pay attention to how long you need to naturally vent vs. immediate vent steam."
5.0 out of 5 stars,Great device for cooking that can take forever in the over.  I have only used a few times but it works like a gem!
4.0 out of 5 stars,"When I opened the unit...I thought I made a mistake and should have bought a 6 qt instead of an 8 qt...however, I'm happy I did get the larger size!  This is my first Instant pot and after hearing so many rave about how great they are, I took the plunge and bought one...I'm glad I did!!  I'm having fun experimenting with it!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"We love our instant pot Duo!  I originally ordered this for my son, but he purchased one on his own, so we decided to keep it even though we'd originally didn't want one.  We've found it such a time saver.  Everything we've cooked in it has has come out fantastic!  There are so many recipes on line that we never have to worry about how to cook some of our old time favorites in the instant pot."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I had been stalking these Instant Pots for a while and got a good deal during Black Friday week.I own a regular over the stove pressure cook which I mainly used for cooking beans, dog food, chicken and meat. I don't need it anymore.I love how I can just set it and forget sinceit has a timer and will turn off.There's nothing magical about it, it is a electric pressure cooker, with some extra functions, but it is really good.I highly recommend it.Have used it so far for chilli, soups, beans, pasta, whole chicken, rice... also for my dogs food."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love this.  I have had it for a week and have made soup, oatmeal and brisket in it.  I am an avid home cook, but i also work full time and have a busy workweek schedule with my children.  The instant pot allows me to provide healthy food in a hurry during the week.  I cannot say enough about it.  The fact that you can brown in it, makes it worth the money!  Before I bought, i read some of the reviews.  Some said you can get rid of your slow cooker and rice cooker.  I will keep my rice cooker, because there are several dishes that can be made in this that would be wonderful over rice.  So if you have both, you can make the rice while the Instant Pot does its thing.  Highly recommend."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Works great. Have cooked many things and the temperature and timing options are so easy to use. Safety features worked great. We tried a stew type of dish, but had it at too high a setting. It set off an alarm as it started to burn, and we were able to save our dinner. Really like this appliance.  Great addition to our kitchen."
1.0 out of 5 stars,"Got one of these as a gift.  Didn't build pressure from day one.  NOT operator error as I had my daughter try it, she has been using one almost daily.  Bit the bullet and ordered a 2nd one.  Worked maybe 5 or 6 times, now the same problem.  I don't put it in the dishwasher and have tried a replacement ring.  Now $150 into this and very disappointed."
5.0 out of 5 stars,Can’t believe I didn’t know before this product exist. I use it every single day that I forgot that I have a stove. I had trouble at the beginning measuring the liquids because I was used to the traditional pressure pot that reduce everything but now I’m a master using my instant pot. I bought one for my mom and she’s loving it as well.
1.0 out of 5 stars,"Have attempted to use it several times now. Never comes up to pressure, and I’m usually making soups or stews that have plenty of water. Several times I’ve gotten a burn warning and had the bottom scorch. How can soup burn? No idea, but the Instant Pot manages it. Cooking with this takes much longer than just cooking on the stove, because I usually have to end up transferring food to a regular pot when the Instant Pot doesn’t work, and then I have double the dishes. Wish I could return, but I missed my return window. Waste of money."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"cute small instant pot, good for rice cooking, I bought a 6qt for soup/air fryer purpose, and bought 3qt one just for rice cookingsame as the 6qt one, the inner stainless pot is a solid quality design, good looking"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Like it, makes making yogurt a breeze.  Have used stovetop pressure cookers all my life (for cooking and canning).  I didn't think I wanted/needed an electric pressure cooker but the yogurt feature is a game changer.  This small size is perfect for yogurt (or small amounts of food w the other modes)."
3.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought one of these last November and was happy with how it was working.  Unfortunately, while lifting it up to place it back in the box for storage, the lid disengaged and the entire unit crashed to the floor, resulting in damage to the inner pot and the outer plastic.  I wrote the company expressing my concern because it was written in very small print in the instructions not to use the lid handle while lifting.  I felt this should be listed more clearly so others don't make the same error.  I have never heard anything about my claim ticket and it's been over a month.  I'm really disappointed and don't plan on buying Instant Pot again."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I LOVE that I can cook/fry/boil/sautéed anything you want. It’s like having another eye for cooking. It’s perfect because I love to cook a lot. I never have enough eyes to cook everything at the same time. THIS item is a game changer.The only draw back is the silver bowl/boiler. It’s not very easy to clean and things stick to the bowl/boiler a lot. After clean, it leaves a weird smear in the metal. I don’t know how to describe it. The bowl/boiler will be clean and clear of residue. It’s like a tarnish. That’s the only drawback to this item.Overall, it does what’s it’s supposed to do and it does it well."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Despite its name, it does not give me instant pot. I still need to use my weed guy.It makes a great stew, though."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"i really did not want to like this but the convenience and range of ability that the instant pot offers won me over. cooking frozen meat, set it and forget it, speed of cooking without sacrificing on taste etc. just made the decision for me to keep the instant pot. There are many other machines on the market now that mimic what the instant pot does, some will say the instant pot copied others, but i am an instant pot fan. decent price during the holidays."

1.0 out of 5 stars,Don't buy this size. You can't use it as a slow cooker because they don't sell the lid for it. They don't sell any accessories for this.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"It took me a few months to break it out of its box and read the instructions, but I am now in love with my IP. i use it a lot! everything has turned out perfectly! Ive used the slow cooker function, the saute function and the pressure cook function to make dinners, hard boiled eggs, and beets for salad topping. Im still wanting to try cheesecake, yogurt and ricotta. the possibilities are endless! one of my top 2 favorite kitchen appliances(next to my vitamix).  Im one that has to research things for at least a year before committing to a purchase. this was well worth the money and i shouldnt have waited so long!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,This thing is amazing. Made some delicious vegetable soup in like 45 minutes!! Made baked potatoes yesterday and they turned out great!!! Good buy!!
5.0 out of 5 stars,"There are already enough reviews that I didn't really need to add my two cents worth, but after using this amazing gadget I couldn't resist putting something in the reviews. I love this thing! I have had a pressure cooker that I have been afraid to use so I gave it away and then I read a ton of reviews about the Instant Pot and decided to take a chance. I am so glad I did! It is super easy to use, even for a scaredy cat like me. It has good safety features, has one touch buttons, and is easy to clean too. The first night I got it, I cooked four chicken breasts in it and when I went to get them out, they fell apart because they were so tender. The best chicken we have ever had! Since then we have cooked soups, potatoes, chicken, oatmeal. My niece has one as well and she loves the timer feature to set it to turn on first thing in the morning and have the oatmeal cooked and ready to serve up before the kiddos wake up. Best kitchen gadget yet!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have now had this for a year. I use it weekly. I use it for soups, stews, braises, beans, pasta . . . I have now bought more for other family members when I find them on sale. I've never understood crock pots. I can put stuff in a Dutch oven. But I totally love a pressure cooker. I've always used a manual one until now. Even my 10 yo son can use this and he has fun making the recipes I've taught him on his own."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought the Instant Pot DUO Plus 6 Qt pressure cooker for my wife for Christmas. She was skeptical at first, thinking it would waste away in some cabinet, never to be used. She was wrong. This is quickly becoming one of the most used appliances in our kitchen. We've used it for anything from sauteing meats, or vegetables, pressure cooking roasts, poultry, and other types of meats. We've used it for cooking dried beans for soups and chili's. It's now our go-to for  making hard boiled eggs. We've even made yogurt in it.My wife now loves her Instant Pot, and if anything, we'd like to upgrade to the 8 Qt version."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought two of these on sale (one as a gift and one for me). The person who got is as a gift hadn’t asked for it but really likes cooking so I thought it was a perfect idea. The day after receiving it, I got a text saying “I made a pot roast in the new Instant Pot in UNDER two hours, and it tastes just as good as the 6 hour crock pot recipe. Thank you so much!” When I got one for myself, I really only bought it to makes soup, but now both my significant other and I try to use it as often as possible."
4.0 out of 5 stars,This model is all I need. This model has the red led screen which stays lit even when off. My other one has a more modern type of screen that goes out when off. I noticed yesterday that it was still warming my empty pot even though  the led said off.  I noticed this once but haven't had time to look into it.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"Got this to replace our standard Crock Pot. Honestly I haven't used it yet but have to comment that I went to Costco the other day and they traditionally have the highest quality products at the best prices. But this 6 quart unit was $109.99 vs. the $79.99 that I paid on Amazon. Assuming it functions as all the other 30,000 reviews claim, I feel like I got the best product for the best price!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I understand why there is a craze for this product. The Instant Pot is a game changer. It is so easy to use. AND, with all the Instant Pot community out there that shares recipes, ideas, knowledge, and support... it is encouraging to try new recipes, as well as to take on old recipes that would have taken forever, which are now done in a fraction of the time.UPDATE (12-31-19):I purchased Instant Pots for family and friends, and they love theirs as well because it is so easy to use. They were also amazed with all of the online Instant Pot communities out there where recipes are shared on Facebook, YouTube, etc... it's endless."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This thing is amazing. I've never had a pressure cooker and it's changed my life. Fast, healthy cooking. It's larger than I imagined, so see some videos to get an idea of how big it is. Also, get some good cookbooks that are specific to the InstaPot to help you get started. Regular pressure cooker cookbooks don't seem to do this thing justice."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"A friend was raving about the Instant Pot, so when it went on sale on Cyber Monday I had to buy one. The order arrived on time and the packaging was great, the original box in another corrugated box.  All pieces were there, and the Instant pot was in good condition.  So far I have prepared two dishes; an amazing pot roast and a delicious Mongolian chicken dish.  The Instant Pot is incredible and cooks food perfectly. I ordered a 7"" spring pan also from Amazon, next a cheesecake I will attempt.  Yes, you heard correctly, I read you can make cheesecake in the Instant Pot, cant wait.  I am in love with my Instant Pot, great choice, great purchase!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I waited a long time to purchase one of these units and I am so happy I bought it. I remember the old way of pressure cooking on the stove, opening the vent too soon and having to clean the ceiling! But, no more! This little beauty is quiet, cooks quickly and is safe. I am delighted with how much less mess I have to clean up and how quickly the food cooks. I can't say enough about how happy I am with this purchase!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Four years later and it is still working great! It is probably my most used kitchen gadget. Couple things...the inner pot doesn’t stay still when you stir the food, but instead moves around with your stirring (specially when there is not much weight inside) so you’ll have to hold it somehow to stirr and the sautee feature acts really fast so make sure you are there to keep an eye on whatever you are sauteing. But these things do not outweigh the convinience, durability, and versatility that this cooker brings. It is fairly easy to clean too."
1.0 out of 5 stars,"At least 60% of the time we use it this machine goes into the ""burn"" warning mode no matter how carefully we follow the directions for preparing the food. If I could I would return it to Amazon for a refund.  This does not make for a helpful way to cook."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Best purchase I've made this year.  I make everything in this, it's easy to use, everything is timed, the accompanying cookbook has great recipes. The instructions are so easy, I've made, rice, lentils, dal, cooked a steak it was to tender.Great gift idea."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I don't use it for things I'd like to be crispy (e.g., chicken, french fries).  I also don't like trying to cook things like bacon in it (the popping grease in that small space provides pain when trying to turn the bacon).  Those are the only two negative things I can say about it.  We use this several times a week, and if there were more than two of us in our house I suspect we'd use it almost every day."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love it!  I'm so glad I got the 8 quart.  I had seen some videos about the Instant Pot and the 8 quart looked huge to me and I was worried about it being too big.  I definitely don't think it's too big.  Matter of fact, after I took mine out of the box I thought Amazon had sent me the 6 quart by mistake and I checked the box to make sure it really was the 8 quart.  I like storing it with the lid off anyway...to let it air out.  I had the Cuisinart pressure cooker before this and the nonstick pot had chip and scratch marks and I felt like I was going to get cancer every time I used it.  I love the IP's stainless steel pot and it is also much easier to clean than my old one."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"The Instant Pot is truly and amazing piece of new technology.  Instant pressure cooking and very short cook times of some tough items, like raw pinto beans and others.  I'm amazed and I don't like to cook.  We had been cooking beans in Crock Pots and took 12 or 13 hours.  Now, the cook time is reduced to less than an hour.  A miracle."
5.0 out of 5 stars,Love this.  This lid gives me the option to use instapot also as air fryer.  Especially good for RV travel when space is a premium.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Purchased my first in 2015 and used it for some things, I didn't love some of the early recipes.  I've still used it for more simple things, rice, making broth, and amazing chicken soups from a whole chicken with water and veggies.  Lately its been getting a lot more use for lunch prep and now 1 isn't enough so I'm back to order an 8qt for more capacity for soups and stews.  I see a lot of negative reviews, mostly because the unhappy people are leaving reviews. There is a facebook group with over 2 million members. Many own multiple Instant pots with few issues mentioned that can't be attributed to either forgetting to put the liner in,  accidentally melting the pot from external factors, or needing a new seal so they are reliable. We're just more motivated to review when we are unhappy."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"The InstantPot is, by far, my most favorite kitchen gadget. Admittedly, I was a late adopter. Thankfully, I jumped into using this thing. From making delicious dinner to the most perfect rice and corn on the cob that serves as a specimen of perfection, this is a one pot wonder! I found it incredibly easy to use and worth every single penny spent. I've used it to replace my rice maker, crock pot, boiling water (for corn) and tools I didn't even know I needed. I've recommended these in person and now on Amazon. The hype on these was definitely earned and not given."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"My only concern when I bought this was that I noticed the pressure is 11 pounds psi and not the 15 pounds psi I thought all pressure cookers conform to. It does take a bit longer than my stove top pressure cooker but not enough to make a huge difference. It's still much faster than conventional cooking. The progam features on it are very good. I just set it up and let it cook and shut off on its own. The removable stainless steel insert makes it easy to clean. I also like that it is multi-use. I don't want to store a bunch of single use cooking gadgets. This is a pressure cooker, a rice cooker and a slow cooker all in one. It's a yogurt maker too but I haven't tried that yet."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love this instant pot. I wasn't sure if I would. I can cook hard boiled eggs in half the time! And cook several dozen at one time. You can cook pasta and dry beans. I had no idea that I really needed this, but I certainly do. I'm still discovering things I can cook in an instant pot. This pot also replaces my large crock pot, so I donated it to charity. I'm looking to buy my dad a little one."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Super fast shipping with great packaging - double boxes!Everything is in the shipment just like online described. It's a bit bigger than what we projected but actually the bigger the better for cooking more. It's very easy to use, but we wish they could also label how much water to put on the manual rather than keep looking at the manual and cooking book together for us.We have tied cooking rice, congee, multi-grain, and beef burgundy with this amazing Instant Pot, and every time is comes out perfect and didn't disappoint us. Did we also mention it's fast with the pressure so it saved us 2~3 times than the regular cooking pot."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"It's a pressure cooker on steroids. It has a lot of options I may never use. However,  the 'Saute' function is pretty much a joke, there is not enough heat in it to saute anything.  But it's nice to be able to set the timer for the pressure cooker and walk away and come back later with food cooked."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I absolutely love my Instant Pot! It was intimidating to figure out how to use it initially, but even if you don't bother with the instruction manuals (guilty), there are plenty of instrutional videos out there to give you and idea of the basics. I've made ribs, stews, soft boiled eggs, roasts, steamed kale, roasted brussel sprouts, baby potatoes, cranberry sauce, steel-cut oats, bone marrow soup, and even a big batch of hot cocoa. Can't wait to get some more accessories (like a spring form pan) to be able to make cakes! My crockpot will be gathering dust and maybe put away for quite a while. What the crockpot does, the Instant Pot does even better, it even has a slow cook feature!"

   I received the pot recently and was very excited to use it given all the buzz around the product.However, the piece on the lid where it says Press and Turn cannot be fully twisted and locked as you can see in the video.Please send us a replacement!!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Do not be afraid to try this. It is amazing. You can cook just about anything in here. It braises, slow cooks, rice cooks. keeps warm. It is so easy. Just enter what you are cooking (meat, rice, pasta) and all the thinking is done for you. I have even cooked several things one after another just to have a head start on weekday meals. You can start it in the morning and come home to a meal, it will keep it warm up to 10 hours. Or you can set it to begin later in the day. There is no fear of food exploding all over like the old manual ones. All the guess work is taken out. Try it, you'll like it! All the reviews I have read on line show this one as the best."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I’m a single mom with a full time job and this has been a life saver for me! I have healthy, home cooked meals on the table in no time. Took some time to learn the functions and timing but steamed veggies in 2 minutes, fall of the bone ribs in 30 minutes flat are a winner for me! Please get one, it will save you plenty of time and hassle on weeknights. There are many different recipes online. You will not regret it."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I got this during black friday sale.  I used it for stews, soups, steamed vegetables, and everything turned out wonderfully.  The best appliance i have in the kitchen. One drawback is that, It's not as fast it claims.  I filled it to the top to make soup one time, it took almost an hour for the pressure to build up.  And you need to wait till the pressure is built up before the pot will start cooking the time that you set.  So in total, I waited for 1.5 hour or so to cook when I thought my soup was going to cook for 45 mins."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This pressure cooker has saved me a few times when I needed to make a quick meal under an hour (including prep and cook time). I've put whole chickens, ribs and made pot roast in it and it always comes out so tender and moist. I just throw the meat and vegetables such as carrots, potatoes, onion and small amount of liquid in the cooker and in less than 30 minutes, I have dinner ready. It's so easy to program the time and there's a booklet that tells you how much time each meat needs. I've recommended to a few of my family and friends already. Love, love this pressure cooker.  I can't say that enough. Go and buy it."
4.0 out of 5 stars,I love the Instant Pot air fryer lid!  It’s so simple to use!  Food comes out perfect!  My only issue is with the inner frying basket.  It doesn’t clean up too easily.  I honestly don’t think the coating on the basket will last that long.  But overall I’m glad I made the purchase.  I also caught a good deal at $65.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I may have commented on this before but it really is a nice appliance to have.  It's not like a standard pressure cooker, but it is one.  But you aren't really aware of it.  It has a lot of bells and whistles which you ave to get acquainted with but after that, it becomes  a very useful implement to have in your kitchen.  I like stews and one-pot meals so this comes in handy."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love this thing.  The Instant Pot has changed the way we cook in our house.  So easy to make delicious meals quickly.  We now make BBQ in 45 minutes and cook chicken thighs in 10.  Easy to use, easy to clean and easy to master.  Device is well built will easy to use controls.  Inner pot is quality stainless steel and the entire thing is very well built.  I would give this 10 stars if I could."
5.0 out of 5 stars,I love my instant pot. My family can make meals easily when I have long days at school or I can throw a meal together with just a few ingredients & it'll be on the table within an hour. It always tastes SO good.I cant believe there are still ppl that don't own one...I'm getting ready to purchase another one so we can have more dishes cooking at one time.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I was really very cautious about getting a pressure cooker, but my friend bought an instant pot and cooked me beef bourgineon (so?) a week or so ago. We were both skeptical and curious and very cautious about using a pressure cooker, because we had both heard of instances where the lid had blown off and hurt people! But  we proceeded and made the most delicious dinner ever! I got one within the week and have since made potato soup twice, some brown rice and some homemade dog food. There are so many things you can do with this tool – I will be using it all the time. It is very versatile. So worth the money. Very high quality product."
2.0 out of 5 stars,This was great while it worked. After about 8 months it started acting up. I turned it off one day and came back into the kitchen for some water a couple of hours later only to find it had turned on stuck on saute mode and the left over sauce in it was boiling like crazy. I thought it was a fluke but it happened again the next time I used it. Only this time it stayed stuck on saute no matter what I did. This is so dangerous as it could cause a major fire.

   I bought this air fryer lid and only used twice, it’s broken for no reasons! I have to return the broken one to the company and I am pissed off!  I read the instruction carefully and properly used it, really doubt the quality."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I was timid at first - but after a few trials I've found this to be essential, especially during the week.  There is a learning curve for planning, i.e., pressure build up time - cooking time - release time, but usually I just factor 15 mins before pressure cooking starts and 15 mins after cooking ends.  So, if you find a recipe that only gives the actual cooking time, just add additional 30 mins.  Saute is the only other feature I have used often, mostly for precooking / browning.  Easy to clean stainless.  Glad I purchased.  You can find tons of recipes online just using ""pressure cook"" as a keyword - along with whatever you want to cook."
2.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought this product and used it happily for about 3 months, probably cooking 1-2 meals in it per week. After three months, the machine made a loud popping sound followed by a hiss and rush of steam from the sides of the pot.  I cleaned it thoroughly and methodically, tried it again, and steam once again exploded out of the front of the pot. So I bought a new sealing ring, even though the previous one showed no signs of defect. And it once again exploded steam out of the front of the pot.  I then went on to the producers website, filled out a support ticket--there is no support number to call--and was sent a message that I should expect processing to take 48 hours to process, maybe a little more.  I am now on Day 11 with a giant defective product taking up space in my small urban kitchen.My other disappointment has been marketing.  I am happy to take the blame for my naivete here, but the whole ""one-minute quinoa!"" and ""three minute steel cut oats!"" promises are complete nonsense. It often takes the product 10-15 minutes to reach pressure, and then several minutes to depressurize. I have found making most grains in this pot is not a time saver at all. If this product worked, I'd likely give it three or four stars--wonderful at braising meats, but not all that much of a game changer as the hype would lead one to believe."
5.0 out of 5 stars,Have the 6qt but use it so much I wanted an 8 qt too for large amount of guests. We use it everyday. Makes life so much easier. Did a test between it and slow cooker with ribs. Took slow cooker 6 hrs to do ribs. Took my Instant Pot 30 minutes.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"Very first meal we made in it was a shrimp boil with potatoes, shrimp, sausage and crab. It was so easy to do and it taste just like it was cooked regularly. If you don't have one yet, get one. You don't even have to thaw the meat out before cooking. It is perfect for those who work but want to have good dinners. From prep to table was 35 minutes."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I thought I had every kitchen gadget there was but I was wrong.  When I heard about the Instant Pot I thought I needed to find out what this was.  Needless to say I got one and love it.  I have an open plan in my home, kitchen, living room and dining room.  It gets hot as soon as I put my stove on.  Now for the summer I wanted something to help with that.  This works fantastic.  The old pressure cookers put steam out while cooking so still produces heat.  The Instant Pot don't work that way.  I cooks it without pushing out the steam until the end when you let it release.  Even then it is barely any steam.  I use this almost everyday and recommend to everyone.  !!"
1.0 out of 5 stars,"Well? Right on time according to other one star's?  My Instant Pot seems to have made its crossing over to the Great Insta-Pot Beyond!  Five months, and less than a dozen uses since purchase, (just like so many one-star others?), it went belly-up with a failure to pressurize, and ""BURNT"" showing on the display?  All vents/valves operating properly, as is the lid gasket!  All good, ..but no good! Five months must be the magic time in Insta-Pot land, because I know there's not a full moon!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,This is a wonderful instant pot accessory and makes great food when we use it but it is not the easiest thing to clean. I have to soak and scrub it. There is still a lot of recipes that I want to try!
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love everything about my Instant Pot. I have had it for about 6 weeks now and it has become my main source of cooking food. It very convenient to put everything in the pot, hit the pressure cook time, and when it comes out everything is always delicious, moist and delectable. And when your done there is literally only one thing to clean and that is the pot, which goes right in the dishwasher. Yes, I highly recommend the Instant Pot DUO Plus."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I would never be able to say enough about this! So I'm not even going to try. I do want to say that this makes prepping and getting dinner done so easy and fast! I've tried over 100 dishes now and some of them are not the best like chicken comes out to drive for me but when making vegetables, rice, and baby back ribs this thing is  Air replaceable. I love it so much that I usually travel with it to my moms house or my brothers or whenever we go away for the weekend. I know it's always a nice alternative to cooking and it's great to have that option"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have had my insta-pot for only a few weeks.. So far I am enjoying it quite a bit. Whether its rice, seven grain, chicken any meat. I have been satisfied with the results very much. I cook a number of things on Sundays for the week. This really saves time as I eat a fair amount of veggies, brown rice, and my own seven-grain cereal. All these cook with less mess and are done quicker!"
1.0 out of 5 stars,Returning. Tried to make fried chicken cutlets and the fryer cooked the top piece and left the rest uncooked.Also there is a layering piece in the middle that is impossible to get out without burning fingers.Cleanup and reboxing for return was easy.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I finally jumped on the Insta Pot wagon and so glad I did!  Definitely makes meal prep easier and is a breeze to clean.  Everything I've made is great and there are a ton of recipes and Facebook groups out there to help broaden your files.  It is very quiet, unlike the pressure cookers my grandmother had.  This is a good size for a family of 2-4."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Today I used my instant pot for the first time, it is wonderful, cook some roasted potatoes with herbs and garlic, they were exquisite and cooked to perfection, in just 7 minutes. After reading the manual, I understood its operation very easy. It is very practical and makes cooking much easier, saving time. Definitely a purchase that changed my life. I highly recommend the instant pot, it is easy to use. And the taste of food is as if it were maximized. In previous occasions I have prepared this dish, the first time I cook it this way, using a pressure cooker, in this case an instant pot, really wonderful, they were delicious."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love it so far! We have been using the Instant pot for about a month now and prepping meals ahead of time to cut down on all the time spent cooking every day. This Instant pot cooks so fast that we will do rolled turkey breast, beef roast, chicken breast, pork roast and hard boiled eggs all in one day to make a months worth of meals ahead of time. Fall off the bone ribs in just 35 min. This is not your mothers pressure cooker. You feel like Ron Popeal with his saying (just set it and forget it) Safe, fast and easy to use, what's not to like?"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"So I must say I’m taking the time to write this review because I have been a crockpot using, pressure cooking, rice cooker kind of girl my whole time in the kitchen. The features were easy to follow. I have now successfully made a stew, homemade chili, and other dishes and less time that it would take me conventionally. This product has not failed me the cleanup has been easy the instructions also easy and accessible. Finding recipes on the Internet are also easily accessible. I am all around completely satisfied with this product good job !!!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,Now I see why these are so popular. Extremely easy to use. Versatile and cooks great and quickly. Easy cleanup.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"We got the 8 quart instant pot because a friend kept bringing over delicious food for us while I was going through cancer treatments.  She is also a cancer survivor.  She said the instant pot helps her make healthy meals quickly.  The first day I had the instant pot, I was able to cook a frozen pork roast with carrots and potatoes in less than an hour.  I was hooked.  I can make wonderful tasting soups in no time.  Veggies cook at nearly the speed of lightening.  While it's not exactly instant, it's pretty close."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought this 9 months ago and have been using it regularly as a pressure cooker. It has saved me a lot of time with softening meats to be braised or put in the air fryer later. I also use it for beans. I also use the sauté function and slow cooker quite often. I have not tried to use it as a rice cooker or to make porridge, though since I fear that an overflow will make the entire thing hard to clean. This is one great investment I made as it reduced my cooking time. No issues with the cooker so far even after so much use. Am happy that the cord is removable enabling us to travel with it for potlucks. Safety features guarantee that pot won't be opened accidentally. I'm getting another one for my mom."
5.0 out of 5 stars,While it is larger and heavier than expected both of these variables are good in the long run. As advertised and delivered ahead of schedule. I will need some help getting started but that is readily available and folks are excited when they learn I got one.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love my Instant Pot and wish I would have bought one sooner! Chili's, soups and meat that would normally take all day to cook in the crockpot is done in less than an hour in the Instant Pot.  Meat is so tender and flavors from all the ingredients are well blended. I love it!"

5.0 out of 5 stars,"Makes a tender beef pot roast real quick.  I followed the included recipe book and the potatoes, carrots and beef came out perfect far faster and easier than I would have thought. This programmable hot pot will replace several other appliances."
5.0 out of 5 stars,The last instant pot that you will by because it's amazing
5.0 out of 5 stars,"One of the best purchases for the kitchen you can buy. I recommend spraying the inside with PAM/cooking spray before cooking rice and oatmeal as they will stick to the bottom of the pan if you push the preset button for rice. Lots of valuable information in the recipe book too.  I really love this thing!Please keep in mind though that even though it may say it only takes 5-6 minutes to make rice, there is a pressure build moment at the beginning of every cook cycle that seems to last about 10 minutes, so you need to add that time to your overall cooking process. Also, the book recommends letting the cooker release the steam naturally after cooking, which can take about another 15 minutes after the cook cycle. This is only an option as you can do a quick release (which I do every time because who wants to wait another 15 minutes).Very happy with this purchase. I would like to buy a smaller one to use side by side and then I wouldn't even need to get out a pan somedays!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"A friend of mine suggested this product to me and I was hesitant at first. I’m glad I made the leap and bought it. This product has saved me so much time and headache of cooking everyday and there are a ton of recipes on YouTube that you try. It takes a couple of tries to get a feel of the product but once you get a hang of it, you are going to love this thing."
3.0 out of 5 stars,"It is very useful, we already used it to make beef stew, rice porridge and steam chicken thighs.  Very convenient, but not sure if it shorten cooking time that much; however, it definitely faster than slow cooker and don't have to monitor it.However, the trivet is missing.  I didn't notice it before.  And when I read the amazon reviews, I notice this is very common problem.  I wonder why the company has not fixed this packaging issue."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I waited a while to write this review. Initially I was afraid the IP would explode. With so many safety features, it's no longer a concern. I've used it many times now and it cannot get any easier. I love that I can cook frozen meat and get dinner on the table at a reasonable time. The 8 quart is perfect for my family. I like to add extra vegetables in foil packs on top of whatever I'm cooking because my family loves vegetables. With the 8 quart, there is plenty of space."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is the best thing that has happened to dinner ever!  Instant Pot is easy to use and the recipes that we have found on line and in the cookbook are amazing!  Cooks rice, quinoa, etc. in minutes and it does not stick.  I LOVE the stainless steel pan!!!  We have cooked entire meals in one pot, some from frozen chicken breast in a matter of minutes.  Black beans are so much easier to cook in the Instant Pot!  I would recommend this to anyone who does not have a lot of time to devote to cooking yet wants to enjoy a home cooked meal.  There are endless recipes for Instant Pot, if you don't buy one you are just working too hard and spending too much time cooking."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have never owned a small pressure cooker. I have canned for years and have 2 21qt. cookers.  I absolutly LOVE this pressure cooker. Just amazing how chili can taste like it has slow cooked on the stove for 3 hrs. in less than 15 minutes.  The stainless steel pan was what tipped me over on this pot. I refuse to get anything with a coating on it anymore. I don't care how careful you are they scratch and chip and you end up eating whatever chemicals make up the coating. I have used it alot making roast, swiss steak, cheesecake, chili, chicken soup and turkey soup with the slow cooker mode.  Just have no complaints so far. Great machine"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I wanted an air fryer but not another appliance taking up space in my apartment kitchen. This is a great accessory and really good investment. I have cooked both frozen and fresh foods in the fryer, under the roaster, re-heated and broiled so far.  It's been 3 weeks and I am still exploring but I am very happy with this lid!"
1.0 out of 5 stars,"I received my instant pot and was planning on making my first meal today, however, when we put it together we found we were missing pieces. It was missing the condensation collector and the extra ring that was stated on the box and in the instruction manual it would come with. How frustrating! Now we have to order those pieces just to get the pot to work and our dinner plans are ruined. Not a great experience for a first time instant post user."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"For those who are looking for simply prepared, efficient, and evenly cooked food/meals, this is a great appliance that solves space issues as well! From omelets to steaks to ribs to spaghetti squash to Italian dishes, a fresh pot of rice, beans, or quinoa! Soups, stews, sauces, grilled meats or bbq dishes & deserts too! For those who are looking to save time, and maximize flavorful well cooked (perfectly, evenly cooked foods), you will not regret this appliance purchase! Enjoy!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Haven't had long, less than a month. Cooked several meals, flavor of food is kept inside pot for delicious meals. Purchased several extra accessories, they're reliable also.  Looking forward to a long & happy relationship with my 6 Qt. Instapot. Thank you for a wonderful product. Wish I bought the 8 Qt. now."
3.0 out of 5 stars,No recipes....NONE at all!  You’d think for the price there’d be a few recipes so you’d know how to operate Isengard different functions.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I wasn't sure about the Instant Pot at first but, after my very first use I am a believer that this is the greatest kitchen gadget ever invented! The first meal I made was Chicken Tikka Masala and the Instant Pot cooked the chicken to perfection! It literally was the most perfectly cooked chicken I've ever made. The Instant Pot is easy to use and even easier to clean! I highly recommend the Instant Pot...and don't forget the accessories!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought this in November 2015 as a Black Friday deal. I LOVE this product!!!!!! I am not a very good cook (always burning or under-cooking things) and this pressure cooker has saved dinner time for my household. It makes my life so much easier to be able to throw in some fresh or frozen food and press some buttons and walk away. Most of the main dinner meals I make are done in under an hour. I love not having the use the oven so much! I have to say that my favorite things that I make in it are oatmeal for myself and my toddlers in the morning (so healthy and the flavors you can do are endless), rice (easiest, fluffiest rice I've ever made), and pulled pork (always so easy to shred once it's cooked)."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I am very happy with the Instantpot, once I figured out how to use it. But I have seen some complaints that the controls can go bad, so I make it a policy to always unplug it after I've finished using it, that way it doesn't get damaged by any electrical surges. It helps to understand how this machine cooks. I read a lot online and watched a few YouTube. Now I really find this gadget is well worth the shelf space. I use it daily. So fast and efficient."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"The Instant Pot is probably the best kitchen appliance I've ever purchased. I own a European pressure cooker that works well and is gorgeous, but it doesn't do a 1/3 of what the Instant Pot does. I've had it three days and so far I've made two pots of perfect brown rice, 3 minute eggs that peeled better than any boiled week-old eggs, cooked a FROZEN chicken breast to perfection in 23 minutes, then removed it, set the cooker to ""sautÃ©"", and thickened the sauce. I've made a delicious taco soup, and right now I have three jars of yogurt in the Instant Pot, fermenting overnight. My daughter was considering a rice cooker. I told her not to bother, but to get the Instant Pot and be able to make her own hummus, baked sweet potatoes and butternut squash in minutes. Set it and forget it. It's so incredibly easy to use. Comes with a recipe book, but there are tons more on the internet and Pinterest! Buy one. I've made a permanent place on the kitchen counter for mine :)."
3.0 out of 5 stars,Not in love with this. Theres nothing wrong with it and it has great options for people who have time for it but instant should not be in the name. It's still time consuming to use and the stove top would be faster for alot of thing. Example- made apple sauce in it. After I got everything peeled and ready to cook it need to cook for 3 mins but by the time it build up pressure and then goes thru the 15 min natural release I could have made it on the stove top faster.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Just got this lid for my Duo 60. First tries at french fries and ribs were fast, easy and very tasty. A little bulky switching between pressure cooking and air frying, but no harder than using 2 separate appliances. Tons of recipes online. I highly recommend this"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I can’t believe I waited so long to buy this! I made pulled chicken for 15 people in it yesterday and actual cooking time was only 10 minutes! (About 25 total of waiting on it to come to pressure and then vent) So.WORTH ITTTTT! Get one! We are a farming family and usually don’t get to eat in the summers until 8-9-10pm, so this time saver is so worth it!"
3.0 out of 5 stars,I feel I have more control over my food using my crock pot and a better tasting meal. The Instant pot has a place just not in my kitchen. I think it would work great for canning food. Other than that I'll keep my slow cooker and donate the instant pot to Good Will.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great that you can just throw the food in, set it and forget it.  Takes a bit of experimenting and learning on how to use it best, mostly how much liquid is needed and how long to cook. Really convenient, easy and fast."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Finally got me one on a Deal of the Day. Been waiting to get caught up in the hype and so far it's been pretty worth it. Still getting the hang of it, but I am pretty impressed on how quickly some meals would have taken in a slow cooker or stove. Still have yet to try stews or soups but I heard from others it is pretty awesome. 8 qt is perfect for our family, and it does take a a fair share of counter space. Cleaning is ok, pot and lid for most of the meals. Hoping to get better with every use."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I had used a stove top pressure cooker for many years until I was no longer able to purchase the sealing rings.  I decided to look into a electric pressure cooker. I read all the reviews on the different pots and decided to purchase the Instant Pot.  I have not been disappointed.  I cooked a 8# turkey breast today at 30.  With pressure build and natural release of pressure, it took under a hour.  I was not disappointed as the turkey was flavorful and moist. Next up is beef stew and a chocolate cheesecake.  It is easy to use."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought my Instant Pot about 3 weeks ago. I have now cooked 6 different recipes in it, from pulled pork to Steel cut oatmeal. I am in love! The only issue I had was with my pulled pork, I had to cook it an additional 10 minutes to get it more ""fall off the bone"" tender. The recipe was written for a stove top model that gets to 15 psi, so it made sense that it would take longer in an electric. I also love the stainless steel pot. I didn't want a coated pot and this is one of the few that comes with stainless steel. It has been very easy to clean, so I really don't see the need for a chemically coated one.I spent over a month researching electric pressure cookers. The Instant Pot got top marks from every reviewer. Now I see why."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"A friend gave me an entry level electric pressure cooker and I was hooked.  When the cheap plastic bits broke, I went looking for a replacement.  I bought this because it was well rated in a majority of the reviews.  I have not been disappointed.The lid/seal not only slides on effortlessly, but generates a series of tones, so you know you have placed it correctly.  The ease of buttons and the flexibility to change the pre-programmed settings makes it incredibly versatile.  The inner pot is stainless so I have no worries about what utensils to use with it (the previous one had a non-stick coating) and is easy to remove and clean.Highest recommendation."
3.0 out of 5 stars,"The air fryer works perfectly!  However; what good is an air fryer if the basket's inner coating where my food is placed peels and breaks off in just a few months.  I carefully followed the cleaning instructions, yet noticed that the coating had come off the basket.  I have contacted the company, and my name has been placed on a list to receive a new basket.  So I am NOT the only consumer experiencing this problem.  As of this date,  I have not received ANY updated correspondence form company despite repeated calls."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I honestly have no idea why I waited so long to purchase one of these.  Frozen to cooked chicken in half an hour? Pulled pork in just over an hour? YES! I was honestly a little scared to buy a pressure cooker as in my mind, it was essentially a bomb sitting on my kitchen counter - especially after reading some horror stories.  However, this is nothing like the pressure cookers of old and the safety features are definitely up to snuff. I feel completely at ease letting this amazing device work its magic in my kitchen!  I even convinced all of the girls in my office to purchase one of their very own.  Everyone should own one!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Bought this to keep in our motorhome for easy meals. I did a breakfast casserole overnight that turned out good and cooked perfectly. Another day I made a slow cooker chili for two. I can’t wait to do beef stew this next trip. I usually prep everything at home and bring it along to simmer in my Instant Pot, love the smell all day!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,We absolutely love this appliance.  We've only cooked a few things in it since purchasing but it has been awesome.  We like to do slow cooked pork but our slow cooker has developed a crack in the dish.  We tried to cook it in the Instant Pot and it turned out incr-edible.  What usually takes a minimum of 4 hours took 90 minutes and was far more tender than what the slow cooker was doing.  I'm excited to try some of the other functions.  We bought the 8-qt version as we have three boys which will eventually be three teen boys that devour everything so this will hopefully allow to cook enough food for everyone.
2.0 out of 5 stars,This is my second Instant Pot. When the first one suddenly stopped working I brushed it off and bought another one on the same day because I really liked the product. Fast forward 7 months and here I am with another Instant Pot that just died and my unfinished dinner. I’m never purchasing this product again.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love this so far! As long as you read the directions and look up recipes online from people who have experimented with times and amounts, it will turn out great! I cook chicken in it mostly because it comes out perfectly. I got the 3-qt size which is perfect for two. If you plan on cooking for more people, you’d probably want one of the two bigger sizes."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love this!We just tried it tonight, and it did a brilliant job of making a sophisticated corn soup, including sauteing the leeks and garlic, then pressure-cooking the corn and corncobs.I look forward to using it for things like brown rice, and dried beans, as well as working as a slow-cooker. It's especially nice that one can saute aromatics in it before proceeding!I'm not sure yet whether we'll retire our rice cooker... but it's promising, and I really love the multi-functionality.Note that this does not provide enough pressure for pressure canning, but it's plenty to expedite various processes.If one has a really small kitchen (or maybe none), this would be a good and effective solution."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I got this to replace my Crockpot when I found out that it could be leaching lead. I've also been wanting a pressure cooker, a rice cooker and a yogurt maker but don't really have the space in my kitchen for all  those appliances. I was happy to stumble upon the Instant Pot which does all of those things. Since getting it I've cooked nearly every meal in it and have used the rice, soup, poultry, slow cooker and yogurt functions. I particularly like that I can saute directly in the pot before adding more ingredients. Usually when using a slow cooker I have to dirty other pans for the prep work."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I am a kitchen gadget junkie. I have 2 Instant Pots and now need a 3rd just for the airfryer lid. Love it. I often make a meal and have both IP's going and have to wait for one to get done. Yes, I still use my stove and oven too. And slow cooker! We rarely eat out and I love to cook."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Pros:1 Accident proof.  I've burnt up more pots & almost started fires in my kitchen using my microwave.  With this pot, I can set it  cooking & walk away & not cause a problem.2 East to use.  Foolproof, in fact.3.Very easy to clean, not like my heavy stainless steel pots.4 Food is healthy than using other cooking methods.5 Cooks to perfection, consistently.Cons:NoneI've never been a cook, but this is the best thing that I ever bought."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"The Instant Pot is great.  The versatility alone makes it worth having and using.  This is my first experience using a pressure cooker.  Easy to program, pretty easy to clean.  I like the stainless steel, although I would say that if you really want to avoid water spots you should be sure to dry it right away after washing.  I guess that's true for most of my stainless steel appliances.  The recipe book that accompanies it is pretty good, and obviously there are (I think) millions of other recipes available in books and on the internet.  I use the Instant Pot most for making bone broth, which comes out nicely and gelatinous after 3-4 hrs of pressure cooking."
1.0 out of 5 stars,"I Tried to cook biryani 2 times. Both times food got burned. The pot had enough liquid. Same recipe I made with my old instant pot and it comes out perfect. Also, my yogurt didn't set. Don't get the duo nova."
5.0 out of 5 stars,I love it! Gave my crock pot to daughter. This has more room. I've used it several times including rice cooker. Brown rice in 15 min. Best pot roast ever made start to finish 45 min. I first bought the Power XL advertised on tv. Didn't like the teflon as it retained the smell of the food and reviews said it peels. This one is easier. My large pot glass lid fits perfectly for slow cooking. I dont know what I did without it!!  Get the 8qt if you're cooking got more than two.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I had a different brand for several years and was very comfortable with a pressure cooker.  It has saved my family from countless drive through runs on busy nights.  But sadly, it suffered some damage during a move and was wearing out so I decided to upgrade to the Instapot.  I got the 8qt because I have two teenage boys at home and I'm so glad I did!  There's a lot of room to make whatever I need and it needs far less liquid to come up to pressure than my old model did.  It's quiet and easy to use.  Everything I've made has come out flavorful, juicy and just perfect.  Highly recommend!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This might be the single greatest purchase I've ever made on Amazon.  I use the Instant Pot weekly, sometimes two or three times a week over the last two years, and I am always pleased with the results.  Primarily I use it as a slow cooker, but I've started branching off into the world of pressure cooking and it's awesome!  Do you want perfect brown rice in about 35 minutes?  Do you want to roast an entire chicken then turn the bones and giblets into stock all in the same pot?  Do you want to come home from work and have dinner already hot, ready, and waiting?  Then buy the Instant Pot!"
4.0 out of 5 stars,"Have only used it a couple of times but, wow - it does what people say it does. I have a smoker and decided to try some pulled pork in this thing. In about an hour, it ""creates"" tender, fall-apart pork. No pulling needed - just poke it with something and the pork falls apart into strings. Crazy. Looking to first do a little smoking in the smoker then transfer it to the Instant Pot to get it to fall apart."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have been cooking with Pressure Cookers for over 25 years and when the seal failed on my 8Q pot and I couldn't find a replacement, I started looking for a new one.  I have to admit I was skeptical of the electric units but after reading the high reviews on this one I decided to give it a try.The pot is very well constructed and I cooked my first meal which required first browning meat then pressuring on high with a rapid release of steam.  it sealed right away without excess heat or water leakage, the meal was fantastic and clean up was a breeze.  I think I found a new friend in my kitchen."
3.0 out of 5 stars,I purchased the 6 qt in January 2017 or that is what I paid for.  Have used it frequently and love it.  But....I just found that I received a discontinued 5 qt model.  I did not realize this until purchasing a replacement non stick pot and it was too large. I turned the instant pot over and it says 5 quart. It was in a box that said 6 quart. Be sure and check your pot by turning over and looking at the label.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This might be the most amazing kitchen invention since the blender.  Seriously.  I can cook a 1.5 lb pork loin in about 45 minutes, chicken breast in under 20 minutes, and make any number of recipes like stews, soups, ribs, etc in a fraction of the time it takes with a crock pot.  And there are approximately 17 billion recipes on YouTube you can follow.There are many brands of this technology, but InstaPot seems to be the best rated if not the most commonly sold.  The quality is excellent, very easy to use and clean up, and the locking lid means you can pack it in your car and take it to a potluck."
4.0 out of 5 stars,Works great.  A little cumbersome and only saves a little space over a separate air fryer. Simple to use.
3.0 out of 5 stars,I love my Instant Pot 3-quart mini. The only problem I have is the lack of accessories for the 3-quart model. I need a lid that will snap onto the inner cooking pot so I can put it directly into the fridge but evidently no one makes lids for it. I have to use foil or plastic wrap that doesn't seal very well. There are lots of accessories available for the 6 and 8 quart models for families and army platoons but they seem to have decided to ignore the 3 quart model for single folks.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I rarely write a review. I buy items based on great reviews, so if I like something, it's hardly noteworthy. This rascal is the exception. This is the greatest kitchen appliance since the knife. Here's what you do: Put the food in, put the top on, push one button, and walk away. I'm not exaggerating. Everything comes out great, Everything goes in the dishwasher, and since it's stainless steel it washes up beautifully. There are videos on You Tube that demonstrate even these simplistic directions. There are different models, with a dandy chart for comparison that I discovered after I bought mine. This should be the go to wedding gift for the decade. There's a review online about some guy who has had one for 2 years and he still raves about it. I've only had mine for 3 months. It arrived well packed, w/ a recipe book, etc."
1.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought an instant pot a few months ago and it worked fine BUT when I wanted to get another one, the box was messed up. One of the corners of the box had a broken seal and the box got wet. It was a light rainy day in NYC.My friend didn't want to try the unit yet because it's ALL WET."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"What can I say about this product.  I bought it on a whim for my Wife for Christmas, and boy has it changed the way we cook!  I bought a refurbished unit, and aside from the packaging being re taped, it looks, and works as brand new.  We absolutely love this Pressure Cooker.  It is a little intimidating at first, but I bought the Instant Pot Cook Book along with it, and we follow as many Instant Pot Groups on Facebook that we can find.  Very easy to use once you get used to it.  It makes One Pot Spaghetti that is out of this world!"
3.0 out of 5 stars,"Am not sure I like this appliance.  Have used it twice.  The first time the meat was tough.  Last night I cooked a pot roast, potatoes & carrots.  The pot roast turned out very good.  The potatoes and carrots were overcooked, almost ""mushy"". That's why I gave it only 3 stars."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I use this thing all the time. Cooking a 3lb whole chicken in 20 minutes and having it come out completely fall off the bone tender... it's heaven. Brown rice is cooked in 20 minutes and is restaurant quality perfect (using the included recipe book for brown rice).So far I've cooked a lot of chicken (both whole and chicken breasts) and a lot of rice. I haven't tried out the slow cooker option yet, and I have yet to really dive into the full potential of this pot. But the time it saves me is impecable.The only downside (and I really can't stress enough how minor it is) is removing the gasket every time I use it to clean it off. But seriously, for the amount of time and multiple pots/utensils you aren't cleaning when you cook meals in it... it makes up for it in spades."
3.0 out of 5 stars,"I don't know why the reviews listed here are for the standard insta-pot (which is great) This is the air fryer mode. The insta pot portion of the appliance is great as usual, but the air fryer portion leaves a lot to be desired. It hasn't browned anything we've tried from chicken to fries to mac n cheese very well. It seems like a bit of a gimmick to me. It makes me wonder if the other brands work any better."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I learned about this product from Chef AJ, thank you Chef AJ!!  We were surprised that the food we cook in this Instant Pot is not just easier... it also tastes better.  It would be worth purchasing just for the convenience it offers, but the enhanced flavor was an unexpected bonus.  We use this to cook all kinds of beans, greens, sweet potatoes, cabbage, etc and they all come out perfect and delicious.  Of course, you can use it to cook meat, as well, but we only eat plants.  Sometimes we use this pressure cooker 2 or 3 times in the same day.  If it ever stops working, I won't hesitate to order another one."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have hesitates for a long time whether we want 3qt or 6qt and finally went with this mini one. It's so perfect for a family of 3. We use it to cook rice, porridge and beans. Love it a lot. Easy to use and clean."
5.0 out of 5 stars,My parents love the new insta pot and keeps telling me how their rice taste better!  Perfect size for a family size of two.
5.0 out of 5 stars,I had heard so much about this that I needed to try it.  I have been having a great time with it but it is a trial and error type of things.  I do not feel that I have found a lot of information out there to answer my questions on timing.  A lot of guessing is happening and so that would be the biggest drawback (if you are not adventurous in cooking) of using this product.  There may be some waist or a few meals you do not like as to how they cooked.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Life saver. It can cook almost everything even it is frozen or not. The best thing is you do not have to stand and wait to cook it. You just put the stuff in it, set it and get it, that is it. Chopped meat ready in 25min. Whole meat ready in 35 min. Rice in 4 min. Vegetables in 4 min. It is also sturdy."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have had my Instant Pot for just over a month now and have had a chance to try out most of its features. I have never been happier with an appliance! I have cooked soup, pasta, potatoes, macaroni and cheese, ribs, chicken, beans, rice - the list goes on. The instant pot is so easy to use, with consistently delicious results. Cleanup is also a breeze since there is just one stainless steel pot to clean. The cord attached to the pot is extremely short, so if your counter space is limited you will need an extension cord or a replacement cord. Overall, I am very pleased and impressed with the Instant Pot. I have used it almost every day and have moved several of my other small appliances into the basement since the Instant Pot replaces them."
3.0 out of 5 stars,"I really want to be able to jump on the instant pot bandwagon and say this is the best thing ever but it's not quite the wonder machine.There are somethings that I regularly cook in it like hard-boiled eggs, soups, and stews but I get super frustrated because I have bought a few instant pot cook books and every recipe just comes out mushy and super gross. I don't feel like it saves much time and I get way better results cooking with my cast iron skillet and using my oven."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I finally caved and bought into the hype and I'm so glad I did! I'm having so much fun exploring recipes to use in the instant pot! I love that I can come home from work, throw a few frozen chicken breast inside and in 15 minutes have juicy, tender, shredded chicken for tacos, soup, ect. I have made mac and cheese, spaghetti and meatballs, bbq ribs, and cheesecake so far, all with great results! Some recipes require some trial and error, but there are lots of Facebook groups, Pinterest boards, etc with other instant pot lovers! This is one of my new favorite appliances!!"
2.0 out of 5 stars,I had to give it a 2 star rating only because from the very beginning it wouldn't cook all the time at first we thought it was just something we were doing but as time went on it just stopped working. I bought it in November of 2016 and it broke by August. I'm guessing it's a bad element because it warms up but it never gets hot enough to pressurize. We really loved it but for that much money and for it not even the last a year I Give It 2 Stars because when it does work it works very well.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Just put in the ingredients and it does the rest. Adds extra fun to cooking. No smells or mess. Easy to clean. The only thing, I had to do a few tries with different timings until I got steamed green beans to the right consistency; I suspect it's the same with other veggies. So the only drawback is that you check the consistency during the cooking processand have to rely on past experience (yours or someone's). But the stews I made were fantastic."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Oh my goodness- I can't get enough of using my new Instant Pot !! I really should get paid for promoting it- I have been talking to everyone about it !!Certainly worth the price- especially since you can go from frozen to table ready in 15-20 minutes !! Take out isn't this quick !!You can even save more time by buying and cutting up your meat and freezing it in portioned freezer bags. I've even gone to the local produce place- bought my veggies, cleaned and chopped them and then freeze them also- this way- I can just dump in whatever amount I need and pop the lid on and I am ready to go !! Also easier to make healthy meals since I take the time to prep and freeze ingredients ahead of time !!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Bought for my daughter for Christmas.  All though I do have same one for years when first came out. I love mine . Durable , easy to use, roast, stews, corn beef and I could go on. All tender juicy and fast. I always forget to take food out of freezer for dinner no problem with instant pot.  Love it!"
3.0 out of 5 stars,"Have been waiting patiently for about 6 months to get one and I am so excited to cook all the things! However, mine arrived in the original packaging but missing a manual and the included recipe book. Wasn't quite sure where to start so thanks pinterest and Google. I'm hoping this will consolidate some things in the kitchen (rice cooker, crockpots) and free up some room. Love that I can saute in it & set a delay timer! So far so good!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,I love this product. It has cut my cooking time down a lot. Very convenient to use and versatile. I have a family of 4 and this is a good size. The bottom is wide enough to actually brown meat before adding other ingredients. Read the instructions for making rice. It is NOT the same as stovetop. It took me about 4 failed rice attempts to figure this out.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I can see why so many people have more than one of these...I start the morning using it for hard boiled eggs -- this makes them so easy to peel! I do the 5-7-5 method.Later, I steam fruits and vegetables for my toddler to eat.I almost always use it for dinner and once a week I like to use it for making yogurt. We have saved a lot of money by not going out to eat after purchasing this product, I recommend it to anyone! Especially if you make a lot of dishes with chicken. I've read that it's not that great for red meats and I don't think it's good for cooking fish but I could be wrong :)"
5.0 out of 5 stars,Got this for Christmas from Amazon. It exceeds my expectations. I have been using analog pressure cookers for over fifty years. This is the future. I just put in the food and push a button and come back in an hour or less and the meal is ready to eat. No worry about overheating and decorating the ceiling with splattered food. Guess how I know about that...Cooked elk stew that was the best ever. Also bean soup from absolutely dry beans. Green pea soup from dry beans. Gonna try a pot roast next and then a pulled pork.Would buy another one and my sister in law bought one at my recommendation. Great product so far.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love this product and use it frequently.  Takes some practice to fully utilize its strengths but it is very versatile.  Best feature is the ability to make complete meals in one pot.This was bigger than I expected so a bit of an investment in footprint.  For just a couple, I probably should have got next size down.Cleaning the lid is a little complicated but well worth it."
3.0 out of 5 stars,Fails to seal appropriately and needs multiple attempts to have it work. When it seals it works good. Customer support not very helpful. Will return it
4.0 out of 5 stars,"Saw some reviews saying the 3 quart size was a better choice for someone cooking for one or 2 people so I go this one .... wrong choice! The 6 quart is what you need, this one is too small. If you wanted a second instant pot this one might come in handy but strongly recommend getting the standard 6 quart version."
5.0 out of 5 stars,I hesitated buying an Instant Pot because I didn’t need another appliance collecting dust but I use it ALL the time. It cooks so well and so fast.  I use it for all kinds of things from making yogurt to compete meals. Also very safe and easy to use in case you’re are afraid of traditional pressure cookers. The best little appliance I’ve ever bought.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've only had this product for two weeks and I enjoy it so much. Everything I've cooked in it has been perfectly cooked. I've used it so far for rice, chicken, a large round roast, ect and it exceeded expectations. This is my first pressure cooker and was hesitant about buying one because of all the misinformation put out there about them. This product worries me less because it takes away all the thinking. I just set a time and it heats up and cooks the food. The product seems well made and the inner pot is durable as I accidentally dropped it once while cleaning it and the pot stayed intact with no scratches or dents. The only faults I've found were the instruction manual and recipe book. The instructions are hard to follow at first but you learn very easily that it just takes a few button presses to get it to do what you want. I'd clarify that the booklets aren't helpful for a beginner like me. Instead I just went to youtube and found a lady explaining how it works. The recipe book has mostly basic or bland food inside of it in my opinion. I'd just use it as a guideline and use your favorite slow cooker recipe or find other recipes online. The results were impressive. It cuts cooking time in half or more with the same or better result. Some of the things like cooking rice, I can't even perfect on a stovetop every time, but this machine does it consistently. Broths are flavorful and deep like they were cooked for hours instead of one. Even the tougher meats become tender and juicy. It is easy to hand clean the inner pot and food rarely sticks. I would definitely recommend this product."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"Works great for 1-2 people. Easy to use, a bit hard to clean. Only complaint is after about a month of use, the nonstick coating on the basket started coming off."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have the larger Instapot and needed something smaller...and an extra electric pressure cooker for ""cook"" day. This smaller pot is just the right size and is easier to store than the larger version which stays on my counter. The control pad is a little different than the larger model ...but is easy to get use to."
5.0 out of 5 stars,The mini is great for one or two people. I love how I can make dried beans in less than an hour without soaking overnight. I can’t believe I didn’t have one sooner!  I bought one for my brothers.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I am a guy not too fond of cooking and cleaning up.  I like working out and eating clean.  I bought the 6QT last weekend for $50 when Amazon warehouse deals had 20% off on them.  It arrived looking brand new except for scratch on the cover, no biggie.  I can say my life is now on a different trajectory because of this product.  Cooking and cleaning up is a breeze.  It cooks amazing foods(I suggest getting a recipe book).  I can cook in large batches for the whole week without too much fuss.  Cooking delicious healthy white fishes is a no brainier.  The best part is cleaning up.  Due to the deep bowl, it doesn't splatter everywhere when cooking.  I use it to saute a lot, it has replaced my electric stove and even my microwave.  I just ordered the non stick bowl for it as the food seems to stick to the stainless steel bowl when searing or sauteing.  Amazing product and I got it at a steal."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Super impressed. First cook out of the box was frozen, bone-in chicken thighs. 15 minutes of pressurized cooking created tender, and fully cooked chicken (fresh is best, but we were testing the cooker).Pictured is a lamb shank. 45 minutes under pressure and the meat was melting off the bone. Using the sear function makes for more flavorful final products.Manual settings are king. Experiment for you own best experiences."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Got this for my sister, she loves it. Wishes it was bigger as it’s a better idea to get the bigger one if you actually want to cook in it. This is great for rice, soups and broth."
5.0 out of 5 stars,Instant pot is very useful in my household that I use it almost everyday. I use it to prepare variety of rice dishes and steam/boil vegetables. It is very helpful in making perfect yogurt and to ferment Indian dosa batter. The scheduling and keep warm features along with the pre programmed options and recommendations to make different dishes are very useful.The instant community support and youtube sources are very helpful to make use of instant pot to the maximum.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"The only thing I wish this product had was a warning beep when you don't have a seal inserted.  If you forget that seal, your meal will bubble over inside the electrical components underneath, which seems dangerous.  Your meal will also most probably not turn out well, without that needed liquid and worse case scenario...burn. They should also provide better instructions with less typos, if they haven't already done that."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Now I have pressure cooker and air fryer with many other options. Works very well. The limited cook book would be nice. I am waiting for cook book to come and will cook more, because now I am a little bit lost. It was great idea to add the air fryer  lid to Instant Pot."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Ok, like everyone else it sat in the box for a while because I was afraid to use it and didn't know what to make in it. Well, I finally took it out of the box and now I don't know how I ever lived without it!! Great recipes all over the internet and so far they have all come out amazing!! Best thing is that you have a meal in less that an hour and that includes food prep and washing and all that crap!! Bottom line, just buy it!!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have 6qrt, 8qrt and his one.  I would say for a household of 1-3 ppl, this is the best choice.  I did not have to over cook too much of the food and put them in the fridge and end up waste it.  Love this mini 3qrt instant pot!  Great buy and must buy"
1.0 out of 5 stars,"The air fryer insert is small, about half the diameter of the pot itself.  You can only get 3 chicken thighs on each layer.  Recipes talk about ribs. There is no way you can get ribs into this small insert. It works great, but you can only cook small portions at a time."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my new favorite kitchen gadget.  Slow cooker meals are great and easy - if you remember to start them on time, several hours before you need them ready.  With this,  I made frozen chicken with sweet potato and apple in 30 minutes. Was very tender,  flavorful and tasted like it had been cooked for hours.  I have also made rice 3x, on the rice setting. 12 minutes, using medium grain white rice. Cooked Chinese dumplings with the stream insert- 7 minutes from frozen. This has made eating healthier home cooked meals simpler, meaning less takeout.  If I buy another, it will be the larger size so I can cook bigger frozen items like roasts.I had the Ninja 3 in 1 for years and this is even better"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"So many of my friends had an Insta pot and have raved about the things they can do they were not kidding. I have turned to making bone broth, instead of many hours it’s so quick. Everything that I’ve made is the flavor of products that have been cooking for hours yet take no time at all. Seer  meats & then add the wet portion of the recipe and in no time you’ve got a meal. Clean up is one pot. So easy!!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I cooked an 8 pound turkey in my Instant Pot.  The meat was juicy and moist.  It was done in just 55 minutes.  Very impressive, Instant Pot!  This small appliance is so worth the money and counter space."
4.0 out of 5 stars,We got a 3qt IP since we are a 2 person household and so far it's been great except.Yogurt option is amazing and making yogurt is a breeze now.It does everything a pressure cooker does but without having to supervise it. It definetly takes a while to cook though. So nothing really instant about it.The delayed timer option helps when you want to come back home to a nice home cooked meal.Con : the sealing ring catches onto the smell of whatever being cooked in the pot and even after multiple washes the smell tends to stay on.
3.0 out of 5 stars,"I wanted an air fryer, since I had an instapot I love, I figured this would be a great add on.  I was disappointed.  It worked fine on french fries but the fish sticks came out soggy.  Not sure if I want to invest in accessories to see if it will help."
5.0 out of 5 stars,Absolutely amazing!! I use it almost every single day and everything is excellent. The only thing I didn't succeed doing well was yogurt but otherwise it's a gem and I almost regret I didn't buy a bigger one. Used to have a slow cooker which sucks and everything tasted blah and boring until I discovered this! it's easy and everything is flavorful. Got the recipe book for it and it's super helpful. Lamb meatballs are to die for! Highly recommended!!!
5.0 out of 5 stars,"use it 3-4 times a week. I watched a TON of youtube videos to learn how to use it properly, and loooooove how quick and easy it is! I wish it was a little easier to clean around the side edges around the rim. Someone suggested I buy a foam paintbrush to get in all the nooks, but I haven't had a chance yet. 5/5 this instant pot is soo worth it! doesn't matter if I forget to thaw dinner, can toss it right in the pot and have perfect chicken breast in 9 minutes."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Bought this for $100 and it is awesome. Our favorite thing it can do is cook up frozen chicken in about 20 minutes. It makes not having to use a crockpot 3 times a week a lot better. If you forget to unthaw the chicken but it’s already 5 PM, the instant pot will save dinner and save a lot of time in just the cooking process."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Got this for a present to the house. My mom used to make not the pot roast, but my sister makes one that is to die for. I’ve tried in the past to do the same not to no avail, a big failure.  Thanks to this magic pot, i can eat pot roast again.  It only took 1.5 hours to do so.  Cooked the roast in 50min and than put the vegies in and cooked them in the gravy.  Only 3 stars on durability because we haven’t had very long.  But wow beef stew awesome. Roasted chicken wow how quick."
3.0 out of 5 stars,"I have owned this cooker for approximately 21 months. While it is durable and somewhat easy to use, it did have some flaws, and has just stopped working. I now get the dreaded C6 error where all lights flash and you can do absolutely nothing. Instant Pot knows about the error, and will make you contact customer support for information regarding a possible repair.There is no mention of any error codes in the manual that came with the cooker. Instant Pot is likely farming out the warranty repairs to a third-party company as a win-win for them and their partners. It's too bad this device had such a short life since the price is a lot higher than competitor cookers.In my opinion, the best feature of this device is the actual stainless steel pot. It has held up nicely without scratching.I hope this review helps someone else."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I really like this pot!  What I like is the predictable results and the short cooking times.  I'm still experimenting with it quite a bit and find more and more things I can do.  For example, http://instantpot.com/steamed-soft-boiled-eggs/ points to a recipe for making soft boiled eggs in the instant pot.  I tried making 3 of them and they came out perfect the first time.  Just put them in for the right amount of time with the right settings and they come out perfect every time!  They are also extremely easy to peel compared to the conventional method of boiling in a pot on the stove."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Under pressure to make a good meal fast?Since this arrived, I have witnessed several ""silent meals"" around my table....with the exception of a little grunting as food is being ingested.Ribs...3 pounds of pork ribs browned in the instant pot on saute with rub and bacon grease....then add 1 cup apple juice and a bunch of redskin potatoes and fresh carrots...pressure cook on high for 40 minutes and it takes about 7 minutes for it to disappear.Roast...the same.Use your imagination or your pintrest or your search engine  ...a very good product so far.Clean up is a FAST process too."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This Instant Pot has everything: HARD BEANS cooked in 30 minutes, TOUGH CUTS turned tender in twenty, and THAT THING where you turn milk into a yummy breakfast in less than 6 hours. I want to make everything in this thing. And you will too.Do you want to pressure cooker but are afraid because whenever you say PRESSURE COOKER someone tells you that their Aunt Ida splattered the walls of her kitchen with blueberry jam once when using one of those things in 1956? Do not be afraid. This pressure cooker could never, ever, possibly let you make Aunt Ida's mistakes. There are so many safety features. Read the manual. Watch a video or two. And you are good to go. The only issue is that you might over cook things because you don't believe it could possibly be done in the amount of time the cookbook allows."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is quite a bit larger and heavier than the 6 qt which I also own, but the extra capacity is worth it when the 6 qt isn't quite big enough. This pot will hold 3 jumbo artichokes, a whole mess of sweet potatoes, and extra large ears of sweet corn (which I just steam for 10 minutes without pressure). And It holds 4 of my favorite jars for yogurt making (whereas the 6 qt only holds 3 jars). I also like to make veggie stock in it. I fill the pot 1/2 - 2/3 full of veggies, top off to the max fill line with water, then pressure cook on high for just 10 minutes. It takes a looong time for the pressure to come down naturally, which means the stock ends up infused like it's been simmering on the stove for hours, but at a fraction of the energy and no watching the pot!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I can only say that the money I spent on this cooker was worth it.  It lasted for 4 years , at a rate of 3 times a week of normal use. I'm getting another one today ( 'cause mine just expired)Cannot complain it cooks good and I've cooked many tasty meals with it...RIP ( lol ).."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"One of my favorite small appliances in my kitchen, used almost daily. Relatively easy to clean (food does get stuck on the bottom sometimes). I mostly use the soup function and tweak it manually because this is not my first electronic pressure cooker and I know how to adjust the time for my needs. The one time I tried the preset Chili function, the food actually burnt a little and stuck to the bottom. I also have my doubts about the slow cooking option  - I tried it once but there are no temperature/time adjustments (or at least I didn't find them - did not read the book either ;)) so it seems to offer fast/high option only. Not a big deal really - I have a standard slow cooker. Anyway, the Instant Pot is a fantastic appliance for busy lifestyle and healthy, delicious and quickly prepared food at home. I highly recommend it."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Been using for several weeks now and the pot is working fine. I like that the pot does not constantly vent steam like the old pot my mom used to use.The pot cooks so fast, that I have been overcooking foods. I am experimenting with less cooking times so that the food is not overcooked. Vegetables only take 2-3 minutes to cook, not the 6 minutes I first used.The standard pressure for a cooker is 15 psi. According to the Instant Pot web page, the government requires that pots be able to withstand 5X normal working pressure which would be 85psi. A pot able to withstand 85 psi would cost about $300. To reduce the cost, this pot operates at 13 psi. This increases cooking time by about 15%. However, the pot cooks so fast that I still need to reduce my cooking time so the food is not overcooked."
5.0 out of 5 stars,One of the best things I bought in years for my kitchen. This thing is worth every cent. It will seem difficult to use it at first but once you know all the tricks and important things then it works like a charm. It's easier to understand if you have used a traditional pressure cooker because then you will know the basic steps to make it work to perfection. But it is much more beyond a pressure cooker. I am glad I went for this model as it suffices my needs to the fullest.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought it for myself but lent it to my son so he could make his hot wings.  He loved the way the wings cooked.  I asked him to keep it a little longer and he has been using it consistently.  Because he loved it so much, I told him to keep it.  Now I have to order another one for myself. I will wait until they go on sale."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"my grand daughter told me about instant pot. I purchased through amazon and my reward points paid for it.  once you understand the concept it is great. makes perfect hard boiled eggs, 4 min pressure cook, 4 min rest, into cold water! Have made pinto beans, great consistency, pasta, sausage rice casserole. looked up recipes on ""instant pot recipes"" so I knew how long to pressure cook. It's great!"
3.0 out of 5 stars,"Doesn’t live up to the hype that most claim that Instant Pot claims. Does some things alright, fails at others. 3 stars may be a stretch — quality seems ok but questionable for $100 price point... if claims weren’t exaggerated and price point at the $50 range I’d give it a higher score"
3.0 out of 5 stars,"Well guess I should review this now. After four years of making rice, bone broth and soup it just won’t turn on anymore. Died in the middle of a bone broth. Bit disappointing but I guess four years is a decent run. My steamer is going on 13 though."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is the BEST, BEST, BEST, pressure cooker you can buy!  I did a lot of research before ordering and am extremely pleased with my purchase.  Compare to the Cuisinart that I already had this one is much better made.  I ordered this one because there is a delay timer function that the Cuisinart does not have.  But found that this one has other features that I like much better than the Cuisinart.  The lid is easy to clean and I love the fact that you can tip the lid into a slot on the side instead of trying to find a place to set it down when you open the cooker.  Just think, I cooked baked beans from dry in the bag to finished on the table in less than 2 hours.  Set it and forget it, how great is that?"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought this cooker for our HOUSEHOLD, not my wife, because buying her kitchen things causes me trouble. I saw a number of recipes, the first being ribs, that made me interested in this cooker. My wife has used it much more than I expected! It's a nice addition to the kitchen. I bought the 8 qt wondering if I should downsize to the 6 qt but I'm glad I chose the 8 qt. A family of four most likely needs 8 qt. 8 qt also gives extra room for bulky items like ribs. The only downside is that, because it's a pressure cooker, it is extra large. We still haven't found a good place to store it."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Just arrived today-cooked the first brisket-very simple to use But important to review warnings and instructions for first use. Excited to use this for beans, rice, and yogurt. The brisket is tender of course but Also has a delicious melting quality which just adds to the mouthfeel and flavor. So simple to get started be sure to have at least a cup of liquid for steam in pressure setting. Sauteeing will improve overall color but other folks seem to run it under broiler. Flavor is great without that. So tender it doesn't ""hold"" a slice.Ordered a warehouse deal through Amazon-great deal, very happy so far.."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm 44 yrs old and this is my first pressure cooker and I absolutely love it!  I wish I would have known about this years ago.  I learned about a similar appliance on an infomercial and I'm one to do a lot of research before I buy anything and it boiled (pun intended) down to the Instant Pot for me, mainly because of the steel inner pot and the great reviews.  I also did a lot of research with YouTube videos and a lot of people used the IP.  I learned how to cook many things, step-by-step from watching a lot of videos, also.  I highly recommend doing this! I don't cook very often because it usually always took too much effort for me and my results were sometimes just okay...BUT, with the IP, I love to cook now!  It makes me an awesome chef even though it does all the work!  I love how simple it is and that I can just throw everything in the pot and we have a VERY tasty meal within half an hour to an hour that would have taken all day in our slow cooker.  Sometimes, I just put frozen meat in there and it has always come out perfect, every time!  I received it on 3/5/15 and I use it about 4-5 days a week (sometimes twice a day)!  I've made an awesome roast beef, pork baby back ribs (my favorite!), beef ribs, pulled pork (twice since it was such a hit!), (mostly) homemade chicken noodle soup, whole chicken and a seafood boil.  My son and I plan on making yogurt with it soon.  I'm taking it over to show my mom how it works and I know she will love it, too!  My mom is the true chef and will cook something all day but when I show her how the IP works, in a fraction of what it takes her to make her famous soups, she will flip!  The best advice I can give is to do your research and watch a lot of videos on how to make your favorite foods and to learn how to make different things that you never thought you'd make and see how simple AND safe it really is!  You will NOT be sorry for buying the IP!  We have also saved so much money, buying cheaper cut meats and having it last with leftovers!  We hardly go out to eat anymore, which is the biggest savings of all!  Get it, I guarantee you will LOVE it!!! :)"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I had 2 over the stove pressure cookers that broke one after the other. My husband was always concerned by the noise they make and would ask me if they're safe to use lol. He originally purchased the 6L for me as a gift but when I opened it I knew it was going to be too small for my family so I exchanged it with 8L (No free returns, we had to pay $14).I already used it twice for pressure cooking and I love it!!! Easy to clear, it makes no noise that all, and cooked my soup with lamb in 45 mins.The size is big so I put it in a dead corner on my kitchen counter."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"My sister and I got this for our mom.  She's having a blast making eggs, soups, and chicken tenders and she's only had it 5 days!!!  It's a perfect size when cooking for 1 or 2 people."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Probably the best thing I have bought in ages...I never cook...and when I do I don't cook well.  So, this has made it seem like I know what I am doing.  The food comes out great.  Definitely worth the money.  Definitely!!!  Once you get the hang of it...nothing is easier or faster."
5.0 out of 5 stars,My go to for everything from steaming vegetables and perfect boiled eggs to 20 minute pork loins & complete roast dinners.Way more versatile than a crockpot.
1.0 out of 5 stars,I ordered the instant pot a month and a half ago.  I use it twice a week.  Already it is not cooking things quickly and I will have to do two cycles of cooking to complete.  I am a prolific cook.  I cook for my large family all the time so I'm pretty sure I'm doing everything correctly.  This is just not a very well made product - will not stand the test of time.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"How can a product have so many positive reviews on Amazon? I read these a bit in disbelief. There's a cult-like following. How can people be obsessed with a device. How can a multi-purpose device really do well at so many things? Doesn't this defy everything I've been told about the best tool for the job is a tool focused on that job?I'm amazed. I've only had this device for a week now. I'm on my 2nd batch of yogurt. Does homemade yogurt really taste better? YES! Definitely YES! There are probably loads of reasons for this, for me it's the sugar. Adjust the sweetener to your liking.I used saute, slow cooker and pressure cooker all on one dish - in one device - in one pot. It happened by accident. I used saute and slow cooker on a stew. I had yet to use the pressure cooker and was a bit nervous as a newbie, so I used slow cooker mode. I got impatient and started the meal a bit too late in the day. I did a little reading and no longer was intimidated by the pressure cooker and went for it. Everything was fantastic.It really is a fabulous device. Multi-functioning at its best. Next on the list to try, hard boiled (steamed!) eggs and then cooking rice."
3.0 out of 5 stars,"Tried making a pot roast but never again.  Was able to sear the meat but as a slow cooker it is terrible.  Put it on slow cooker more setting which is the highest it will go. Never saw it simmer and it took about 20 hours for a 4-lb roast.  As a pressure cooker, it is far too finicky. If the sauce is too thick or the pot is not deglazed enough  be prepared to get ""Burnt"" alarm.  Glad I didn't throw away my rice cooker."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I loved how convenient it is and the lack of using greasy fat.Last night I did baked potatoes in it - just brushed with oil, rolled in sea salt, cooked (fried) for 40 minutes. Delicate inside and with skin so delicious we ate it all! With light toppings of butter, cheese, bacon and chives."
3.0 out of 5 stars,"So far, so good. I've only had this for about a week but the nozzle on the cover is loose. Is it supposed to be this loose even when when I am using the pot? I can see this being a dangerous problem in the future. Can someone confirm if the nozzle is supposed to be loose at all times?"
4.0 out of 5 stars,"I love the versatility. It really does not feel like it makes things any more quickly, but it does make the process of many meals so much easier.  I am mentioning all the negative things about it, but how much easier it makes some things to do is 100% worth it. I love it from cooking beans to making a casserole  to rising bread and making yogurt. Trying to let the steam out manually often does not seem safe.  Also, you  most likely need to purchase accessories to make all that you want and the ring on the lid starts to smell pretty quickly.  Honestly, the only thing it does better than I can do is make yogurt and rice bread as well as cooking beans in a much much much shorter period of time.  Again, I love mine and use it for many things."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love the instant pot! I have been using it tons, makes brown rice in 3 minutes. Chicken rice stew in 7. Stainless steel inner pot cleans up very easily and quickly. It’s safe and has useful manual controls."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is most likely the most brilliant 21st-century adaptation of the tried-and-true pressure cooker. It's blazingly fast, and the functions and presets are making any cooking job easier. The build quality is sturdy and the buttons 'click' with the right amount of tactile feedback. How well they'll hold up - time will tell. However, in talking to current owners of Instant Pots, I haven't heard of one breaking down yet.As an example, a 4lb beef roast took less than 1-hr from start to finish and then went into a 10-hr 'warm-cycle'. Set it up before leaving the house in the morning, have a ready to go, warm dinner when you return. It's almost too good."
5.0 out of 5 stars,I bought this for my wife who enjoys cooking a lot. She is in absolute love with it. She's tried various Indian recipes and they've turned out so well. According to her it's a very versatile cookware and now has replaced many of her traditional pots. Happy wife happy life!
5.0 out of 5 stars,I liked everything about it.  We have only tried 3 different meals with it and once we figured out how to use it properly it worked great.  Glad we bought it.  It will take some of the work away from our air fryer but that's ok.  Might get a 6 quart the next time to go along with this 8 quart one.  YouTube videos sure helped us decide on what model to get and how to use this one.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I set it up yesterday and did a practice run using water only.It seems simple, intuitive and was super easy to clean.My friend got me into it and so far I made a 4lb rack of pork back ribs and they were delicious.Can't wait to try some other meals like curries, refried beans and all the desserts!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I am not one who knows how to cook really intricate dishes, so having this pressure cooker has really saved me money by allowing me to cook at home more! I made quinoa for the first time ever and it was delicious, then I made chili, and it's always turned out great! I love this thing!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,My entire family just joined weight watchers and we have made many meals in this pot.  LOVE IT!  The only thing that needs improvement is the instructions.  I was unable to get the lid off for a few hours after my food was cooked.  My friend explained to me in detail how natural and manual release works and now I get it.  The book needs to include this valuable information.
5.0 out of 5 stars,My wife asked for pressure cooker for Xmas so I started doing a search for a good model.  I asked for my daughter's advice and she gave me some recommendations and pointed out that I would need to get an electric because a stove top model will not work on a glass stove top.  My daughter also said that she had been thinking about getter a new pressure cooker.  After more research it was clear that the IP was the best model so I ordered one for my wife and one for my daughter.  My wife has used the IP several times with great results and my daughter uses her's about once a week and loves it.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I really like this pot which has a lot of functions for use. The most important reason for me to purchase this is because I need to use this pot for cooking rice. With the low pressure that I always use, it takes about 12 mins to finish the work. From the guide book, it clearly points out that cooking rice just needs about 4 mins, I guess that's for high pressure, I will try more functions in the future. Very recommend for people who need to cook rice every day:)"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I used to cook bone broth and soups in steel pots. The issue is, I have to keep an eye on it in case the soup comes out, which takes me a lot of time. Now with this pressure cooker, I can just put things inside it and leave it. I can do my things and then it will beep when everything is perfectly ready. If you care about speed and reliability, this is the one to use. By the way, do read the instructions carefully to avoid mishandling it. It also comes with recipes that are really useful and inspirational."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my first pressure cooker so I did not know what to expect.The ""recipe"" book is kind of vague, at first but then things start to make sense once you start using the machine..I found ALL kinds of recipes (tips and tricks) online too. Don't forget about google :)So far I've only cooked chicken (whole chicken in pieces) and it came out real good, fall off the bone good, rice and vegetables.I cooked asparagus and broccoli together, and they came out like MUSH but I am sure its because I put them in there too long.. thats the learning curve of this machine is timing.I still like my good ole fashion crockpot but this will take away some of my crockpot's business."
5.0 out of 5 stars,I receive this instant pot a couple weeks ago and I absolutely freaking love this thing. I have used it approximately 6 times already with different dishes. It's super easy to use Easy to program and very easy to clean well worth the money I got rid of my slow cooker because I hate waiting the longest cook time I've had to do this 30 minutes verses 6 to 8 hours in a slow cooker. I highly recommend this product and would definitely purchase this product again but I would probably get the 8 quart just because I like to cook in advance and have it last for a few days. We Are Family of 4 and the six quart is perfect
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This thing is great! We have used it for beans, for slow cooking, for rice, for pressure cooking wild pheasant (which can be somewhat tough), for browning chicken before adding to a recipe - these things and more and it has performed flawlessly every time. 

  
Instant Pot IP-DUO60 7-in-1 Multi-Functional Pressure Cooker, 6Qt/1000W









  
  
    
  After using this for 3+ years I love it even more. My one complaint - the cord is too darned stiff! Good grief it's like some of my cheap extension cords when I try to use them outdoors when it is below zero here in ND."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Wow, waited a few months to try out. Definitely recommended for the small house environment. It cuts down time to prepare almost any meal to eat in the same day. Again, small house. I believe up to 4 people can be served with whatever is prepared in this unit."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I just love my Instant pot!! I've made so many things I can't begin to name them. I highly suggest, anyone who's considering this for the first time, that you check out videos on YouTube that show how it works and other things about it so you'll know if it's for you. This model also is self sealing when the lid is in place unlike some other models that you have to sealing manually and possibly forget thus messing up your recipe."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"I like the combinations that this InstaPot offers. I must admit it is easy to use for basic cooking, but it's a bit intimidating for all of the steps involved for the other features, rice, yogurt, etc. I need to practice. I got it on a Super Cyber Sale and the high-end prices were reduced to $49. That's why I chose it."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great product and lots of options.  If you have the cash and are looking for a slow cooker/pressure cooker option to reduce your gadgets, this is the thing to get."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Tenía una olla a presión eléctrica Oster, pero quería una olla de lento cocimiento para hacer birria (la hacía en la de presión y si quedaba muy bien, pero nada como hacerla en la de lento, se conjugan aún más los sabores), pero no quería tener 2 ollas, así que estuve cazando ofertas para comprar la IP, y la verdad, siento que deja mejor consistencia de los alimentos y en menor tiempo que mi olla vieja, definitivamente la recomiendo. Además si siento que es más fácil de limpiar, y como la olla es de acero, si se le llega a pegar algo, pues la puedes limpiar con un estropajo metálico sin problema. Vale la pena la inversión, porque tienes muchos electrodomésticos en uno, ahora estoy esperando una buena oferta en la air fryer lid, para sacarle aún más provecho 😊"
5.0 out of 5 stars,I had been hesitant to buy an Instant Pot for a while partly due to the price and partly due to the amount of poor reviews due to seal issues. I have had no issues with mine after having for over 6 months. I use it on average twice a week and it is my favorite to make quick soups in for healthy weekly lunches.
3.0 out of 5 stars,"It's a cooker, okay?  Recipes for pressure cooking seem to require a lot of labor and, since you often have to let the pressure release ""naturally,"" doesn't save a lot of time.  Does do a creditable job as a slow cooker, however.  Have not tried the yogurt making (not sure that would work at the temperatures the unit can sustain) or the rice cooking.  Does not knock my socks off, but it is a well made product and probably worth the price as an upscale multi-cooking device."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"I like this appliance.  You can cook almost anything from start to finish in it.  However, you only have one temperature (very hot) for saute.  It is not like a skillet where you can monitor the process and adjust the temperature.  Also, I recommend buying the tempered glass lid (sold separately) so you can monitor the cooking process. Note:  The Instant Pot key pad will light up the word ""BURN"" when using the pressure cooker feature...too late to salvage the contents!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"The instant pot is great. I was actually a little skeptical before I bought it. I am glad that I did purchase it. It is so easy to use, and so fast. I wanted it to be able to cook something quick after working all day. I am not great at getting supper in the crockpot before work, so this works out great."
2.0 out of 5 stars,"We really liked our Instant Pot. It was easy to use, easy to clean, and we made some great dishes in it. We used it about once a week. Then one day, after owning the Instant Pot for about 15 months, it suddenly stopped working--just gave up the ghost right in the middle of cooking a meal. We are disappointed that it broke down right after the warranty expired. Instant Pot is a good idea, but way overpriced for the short amount of time that we were able to use it."
3.0 out of 5 stars,Is this Instant Pot one of the models being recalled due to a fire hazard? It would be nice if the seller let all of us who bought this know whether it is subject to recall. News reports have indicated some models are being recalled.
1.0 out of 5 stars,Had this item barely a month and it stopped working.I have the IP 60LUX and was thrilled to get this model.Amazon won't exchange it. Instant Pot people.... ?!?
5.0 out of 5 stars,"My wife has been using hers since late summer.  This has definitely replaced the Bosch mixer as the most useful kitchen appliance. It seems there is a cult like following for this particular brand of electronic pressure cooker. Possibility because of its versatility. We are trying to move to a mostly plant based diet, this has proved invaluable speeding up meal prep and opened up new ways to prepare foods.The best feature is the Yogurt setting.  I really like the way the yogurt turns out so it can be mixed with my breakfast cereal.For Christmas we got a few more to give to other family members."
1.0 out of 5 stars,"This liner is the worst item I've ever seen. used one, immediately removed the food after it was complete and the finish was already worn off. next use the area scorched. I called the company and on hold x 1 hour and they never replied by phone email either"
5.0 out of 5 stars,This thing is FANTASTIC! I bought this for my wife as a pre Christmas present and we use it 3-4 times a week! It’s a game changer for cooking! And tonight I did a rack of ribs...i never had a great rack in the smoker but these fell off the bone after 1.5 hrs and I finished them in the iced with sauce for 30 min. Best ribs I’ve ever made and maybe even had?! Love the instapot! And I’m a dude?!?!
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love it!!!! there are so many things you can do with it! the 8qt is a lot bigger than i expected, takes up a lot of room on my counter, but i dont even care. I've made rice, chicken, brisket, turkey, hamburger helper style pasta, stroganoff, meat loaf, salmon, and more and i just got it a month ago. I would say though unless you really know how to use all the function, you dont need the 9-in-1 you are totally fine getting the cheaper version that offers less functions bc you can set the pressure cooker with whatever time you want on it. Thats the one i tend to use the most. has a crockpot function which i havent found a reason to use, but once I do I will look into getting rid of my crockpot."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Wow, I bought this used/refurb product.  I can't tell the difference.  Item arrived in original box and no dents on the brown packaging box and no damage to the original manufacturer's box.  When I opened it, all parts were in plastic and foam packaging.  Absolutely no damage, it looks brand new.  My wife used it and works wonderfully.  She was surprised when it turned off automatically when she cooked dinner with it.  This is an item we will be using quite a bit.  Can't wait to use the other settings on this Instant Pot."
5.0 out of 5 stars,Very happy with my Instant Pot.  I've already used it several times with success. It's relatively easy to use and isn't intimidating like the old fashioned pressure cookers.  I love that I can use this as a slow cooker as well.  It's a life changer in the kitchen!
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought this at the beginning of the year and have used it many times for a variety of meals. The sauté setting works great for searing meat prior to cooking it. Everything I've cooked in it has come out good. Easy to clean, and the stainless steal pot has held up well. I bought two more to give to my daughters."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Bought these two as gifts. I've used mine for about a year now, and we use it almost every day. Everything from perfect boiled eggs to pork loin to great steamed vegetables. If you haven't used one before, just Google the many recipes online for great results."
2.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my first pressure cooker, I love it! It is so easy to use and clean, I have made chicken noodle soup, beef roast with vegetables and macaroni and cheese in it this week and it was all wonderful. I would recommend this!*** UPDATE***well here I am only 9 months after purchasing the instant pot pressure cooker. now I am having a lot of problems with the unit sealing. It gets hot then the timer starts and the thing hasn't even sealed yet. sometimes I can push down on the lid and get it to seal and sometimes the seal just falls. cleaned the valve and rubber in the lid very well as I do each time I have used it but it just doesn't work good anymore. Too bad, I loved cooking with it but just no good when I paid so much and it didn't even last a year.  :-("
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Simple buttons, basic safety warnings, fast cooking, slow cooking, timed delay, easy enough to clean-up...  awesome cooking...  there are so many reasons why I love it!  I cooked rice with it for my test run and it came out perfect.  The instructions and warnings said the pressure would be a hazard and they were right.  The pressure that came out of the release valve was intense and I am happy I read and expected that.  I also expect to cook great things with this new electric kitchen pot.  Great things!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Well I finally jumped on the bandwagon and I have to say I really love it.  I made a rich, delicious dinner in 15 min, and since all the action is happening inside the pot I was able to clean the kitchen and get some laundry done during that time.  I'm sure there are plenty of other electric pressure cookers out there that are just as great as the Instant Pot, but I went with the cult following because that's how I roll."
2.0 out of 5 stars,I like it right up until tonight when it wouldn't turn on.  No power at all to the screen.  Awesome for eggs.  Too bad it doesn't work now.  One week outside of the return window.  Sheesh.  Will buy electronics at Costco from now on because of the better warranty and replacement policy.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Super easy to use, very straightforward controls. It doesn’t fit as tight as I would have expected onto the pot, but worked great, so I suppose it all good! Was so nice to cook frozen nuggets in a matter of a couple minutes without beating the oven, then switch to fried green beans, all in the same device, and everything was cooked to perfection!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"We use this cooker for EVERYTHING. We can prepare 3-4 days of meals in a couple hours on a Saturday morning. Simple to setup, use and clean. Looking forward to using it this summer with our big veggie garden. A decent size deep freezer is a good partner for the pressure cooker."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I had an instant pot, but I also wanted an air fryer. I did NOT want want to buy another cooking gadget, so this air fryer lid totally saved me on space and money. I love it so much! Doesn’t take up too much room at all and has many functions. Comes with a basket, metal tray insert and cooling mat to set the lid down on. Absolute deal and space saver!!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,I expected we would get enough use out of this to make it worth buying. I did not expect to be using it nearly every day for one thing or another. This is one of the better gadgets/devices we've purchased.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is the second review I'm doing, first one was: ""easy to set up and go""... This review is more like BEST KITCHEN TOOL ever!Okay, so, I never owned a pressure cooker before and well I'm not sure I could live without this one now. We use it for quick roast, vegetables, ribs, rice, WHOLE CHICKEN! The saute function is perfect for one pan preparation keep all the juices together and who wants to clean more pans.PAN INSERT IS A STAINLESS STEEL, VERY EASY TO CARE FOR! Construction is very sturdy and you don't feel scared moving it while it's cooking as the locking mechanism is very secure.WE HAVE COOKED:Beans (Dried) 30 min and done!Med sized but thick Lasagna you would put in the oven with dry noodles, done in 10-15 min!Roast cook it about 40-50% of the time you would have cooked it in the oven, I even took a 5yr old freezer burnt, rump roast and was sure it was going to be bad, spongy texture, no taste and poor quality cut (I was experimenting) so why not.... I cooked it a little bit longer and HOLY COW it was totally fine, texture was not ""fresh"" but it was five years old! It was flaking apart and tasty with the seasonings I used, my husband the stake lover couldn't believe it.I am continuing to try new dishes and have not had to throw anything away, I dare you to throw anything you got in it and go!  Don't be afraid to go off label on the directions, except... realize that if you fill it with liquid it will spray it out if you want to quick release the pressure, don't overfill it. 6Qts is big enough and cut the rump in half but feel free to stack it a bit to get it all in!I bet WILD GAME would be a breeze in this!Hope you enjoy!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I just cooked in it for the first time today. I had a whole chicken and I put it on pressure cook, it only took 35 minutes and it was fall off the bone ready. I now will be able to use it in my dinner I am going to be doing tonight in a skillet so it's perfect."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This thing literally changed my life. When you're keeping a Paleo diet, you have to cook a lot. The instant pot takes a little bit of the sting out of it. It really is set and forget - for most of my meals I just throw all the ingredients in and set it for a time I found online. This means I can often cook more than one meal at once, and the large capacity means I can always have leftovers for lunch the next day. This thing will save you so many hours of annoyance, and it's the easiest thing to clean that I own. It has completely replaced my crock pot, with the added benefit of it not having to stink my house up for 10 hours. Instead, the same meal can be done in literally thirty minutes. I wish I had bought this thing years ago."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I was skeptical from the start but this thing is pretty great. Once you get past all the buttons on the front it's also easy to use.Most stove top and slow cooker recipes can be made using the pressure cook setting in a fraction of the normal cook time.The pressure cook function makes:Incredible stock and brothPerfect boiled eggs - hard, medium, or soft cookedDelicious Chili, soup or stewTender Pulled pork, carnitas, shredded chicken, pot roast... you get itAnd so much more"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Instant Pot has made my life so much easier and saved me a ton of time. I rarely use my stove. I hate old fashioned pressure cookers and slow cookers. Instant Pot is easy to use, safe, and straight forward. You really can’t mess up. I love it so much I bought 2."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Oh my gosh...I am in love with this appliance!  People had been telling me for years to get an updated pressure cooker.  Why-oh-why did I wait so long?  I am a very lazy cook,  and this makes cooking so unbelievable easy.  I was intimidated when it first arrived, but I read the instructions, did the test-drive (suggested by the manufacturer) and proceeded to make the best darn roast we've ever had.  I have used it every single day since getting it.  Buy it!  Just buy it, you will LOVE IT.  It borders on miraculous."
2.0 out of 5 stars,"won't feed even two people, waaaay to smalland you need free space for air to circulate.went with 10q vortex plus from the same company and very happy with it"
5.0 out of 5 stars,Just wow!! Love my mini IP. Got it yesterday and I can just see myself using it everyday. It did get cumbersome to pull out the 6qt one every time...
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I use it mostly to cook dog food.  Every week, I put chicken breasts, yams, various vegetables and oatmeal in the insta pot  and in 40 minutes I have my dogs done for the week. So much quicker and easier than using all the pots I used to have to use"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love the efficiency of this thing. I have only used it several times and it has already saved me so much time in the kitchen cooking. I just throw the ingredients in and set it to pressure and I have a big quantity of awesome food ready within an hour at most (depending on what I cook) I have done lentil soup with potatoes and cooked dry black beans so far, tasted splendid. Highly recommend, worth the investment already. This thing will save me money and time"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is the best gadgets in the kitchen. I love it it's makes from soups, stews, meats, beans, veggies and more in one simple pot. I made soups, beans, stew, chicken curry, pork loin with sour kraut, what I can say was WOW. we had friend for dinner when I made pork loin with sour kraut, everybody had second plate❤The all spices and vegetables keeps the aroma that makes the dish more delicious. I can make dinner from start to finish in IP in 30 - 60 minutes. If you have frozen meat it my take little longer. You can start with sauté veggies or meat in the same pot. You can cook slow or fast. It's time saver and just one pot to wash after cooking whole dinner. I did not try baking in yet but I saw recipes from other IP pressure cooker. Still not convinced, that way I'm using the conventional oven. I'm recommending to all people who did not try to cook in IP pressure cooker to try. They will cut their time in the kitchen in 2/3. The different between food cook on regular stove and in the pressure cook is that all the goodies from vegetables, herbs and spices stays in the dish cook in pressure cooker because nothing escaping from the IP. I try soups, beans, lentils, vegetables, stew, chix curry, pork loin with sour kraut, you can't imagine the palette of aroma in the dishes.Thank you so much honey for my birthday gift. You make my life easier."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Beginning to love it ,10,000 times better than crockpot  I'm a single man ,the 3 qt just right  , no better pot roast"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"What can I say that other 5 star reviewers haven't said?  This thing is AMAZING!  There is a bit of a learning curve if you're not familiar with Pressure cooking but this pot does SO much more.  I was afraid to purchase so I researched the many online Instant Pot Communities & Videos  (Facebook/Youtube) that offer support and information for use, or guidance as to which model or size to buy.  You'll be amazed at the things you're able to cook in this pot, the Pressure Cooker feature is a timesaver.  I never cooked much, but this item has opened up a whole new world of cooking for me."
3.0 out of 5 stars,"Would not purchase again.  Makes good soups or stews.  Maybe a little quicker but I had just as soon use my old pot.  also, tried a roast and it was tough.  The potatoes and carrots were almost mush.  Maybe I need to learn more but I am not excited about it anymore.  Sorry I purchased one for my sister for Christmas."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Yes, it is as great as everyone says. I've had mine for about 6 weeks and have been using it non-stop since it arrived. It's so nice to prepare a ""slow roasted"" piece of meat and have it done in 1-2 hours instead of 6-8 or more. I love to cook my chicken wings for a little while to render out most of the fat before crisping them up in the oven. The instant pot made this super fast. Spaghetti squash, a great low carb, paleo option, which can be pretty labor intensive, is super easy with the instant pot. My only complaint is that it does retain food smells a little bit. I'm guessing it's the rubber gasket on the lid that is responsible, but I'm not sure. I was a little concerned that it wouldn't be large enough, but so far I've found it to be just the right size. There is a learning curve to figuring out how long to cook each type of food. Recipes abound on the internet so read lots. Just keep in mind that lots of people don't include the time it take to come to pressure and depressurize. So if something cooks for 20 minutes, total time might be closer to 45 minutes. I found youtube videos helpful as well."
2.0 out of 5 stars,"The C6 error code comes up. The manual says ""pressure sensor"" problem. The instant pot has dual sensors. Searched high and low online and no replacement parts are found. Contacted customer service and submitted photos. Then no answer. Made contact again. Still no answer......"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Made first meal and it is easy to use. Make sure to read the getting started directions first. Note:  it could take 15-40 minutes to preheat before ready to heat/pressure cook meal. During that time the machine only says ""on"". Once pre-heated the timer counts down. We missed that at first in the directions. Found lots of great recipes on Pinterest."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"We just started using this a lot recently. It's so easy to use and everything comes out amazing!!!!!!! It truly makes a difference in distributing such tremendous flavor throughout. We are truly in love now. We have cooked red beans, the best turkey chili, chicken stock, quinoa, and rice. They are come out better than ever before. The sauté feature is such a bonus as we have even cooked turkey burgers in it when we had no other range top to use at the time. We are in love and the fact this is stainless steel over the commercial pots like this makes it the best buy in terms of health concerns. We love love love it!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,The Instant Pot arrived about three weeks ago and I love it. It's so useful when you have a giant gas stove that takes an enormous amount of energy to use. It does everything except baking bread and roasting.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"if you dont have an instant pot, hurry up and purchase one.  these are definitely a time saver and it keeps all the moisture in your food.  i love making rice, soups, meats, pasta, etc in this.  the best part of it is that you can throw in raw frozen meat and they'll come out perfectly cooked!definite must have!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've used this cooker twice so far, and it has performed admirably. First I cooked a pound of beans. The second time I made Chicken Enchilada Soup. The cooker is easier to use than I thought it would be, but the manual could be better. The manual does not go into detail about the Soup, Meat and other cycles. Because of this, I won't be using those unless I stumble upon recipes that specifically use them.I don't know how long this cooker will last, as I don't really trust digital stuff to go the distance. That said, I would never have used a manual pressure cooker due to the fear of an explosion. The electric pressure cooker is easy to use and has many safety features to prevent that from happening."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great product. I was a bit afraid of the pressure cooker aspect, but all the safety features built into this product helped. After reading the instructions I was able to cook a fall off the bone pork lion in 50 minutes. You can brown the meat first and then pressure cook it. So many options in this product look forward to trying it for everything."
1.0 out of 5 stars,"I HATE THIS THING!!!!no matter what I put in it or how filled it is, the build up time is AT LEAST 30 MINUTES.Add to that ANOTHER 10 TO 15 MINUTES for this piece of garbage to depressurize, and it saves ZERO time.A waste of money and a waste of storage space in my kitchen.I gave mine to a friend I'm not particularly fond of"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"OMG!!!! I usually don't write reviews, but I had to for this product... so I was with my husband who was getting new eye glasses, and I happened to mention to the secretary that i'm a teacher and use my crock pot alot... She said her daughter is a teacher and uses an Instant pot... I said what is that, and she proceeded to tell me...Well, I raqn home that night, ordered one on Amazon prime, I got it yesterday and have made 3 things already over the weekend!  Baked potatoes, no drips!!!! No boiling over!!! Beets (for a summer beet salad) NO RED STOVE!!!! I'm making beef stew tonight, and I'm sure it will be fabulous!  Ladies, you need to get one of these,I wish I would have found out sooner...."
5.0 out of 5 stars,I was looking for a slow cooker due to fears of pressure cooking.  The Instant Pot eliminated my fears and is an absolute must !It's versatile and beyond easy to use with so many recipes your bound to find what works for you.Out of the box I was cooking in minutes.The clean up is a breeze and qaulity is best in class.The price is beyond fair for the multiple uses you will enjoy. I did much research and Instant Pot was very popular and highly acclaimed and I'm on board to fully agree !
1.0 out of 5 stars,"After beginning my slow cooker meal, I received an error message.  I looked up the meaning & it said that I had done nothing wrong but that it had to be returned to the manufacturer.  Luckily,  I was able to transfer the meal to another slow cooker.  I called Amazon & the appliance is now being returned for good."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Oh yeah, if you are looking at buying one of these all-in-one pressures cookers let me save you some time-- just buy this one.  It does everything short of cutting up the vegetables, setting the table and ""yelling dinner is ready"".  Wait on second thought, it does ""yell dinner is ready"" in the form of a cool little tune it plays when it is done.I have made countless meals in this thing and I have only had it about a month. And for reference it is the second all-in-one pressure cooker I have owned (though I had a different brand).  This one is much nicer, has more features, and most importantly for me, has a  stainless steel pot instead of a teflon coated pot."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love it, this thing is awesome, I use it 3-5 days a week, easy to clean!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Ordered on November 28, 2016.Today, I turned it and the power went off.  Power cord flaw? ah-HAH! NOPE!  While I didn't loosen the detachable cord on purpose, apparently in turning it and turning it back (so it didn't vent under my cabinets) it had wiggled itself loose.  Re-plugged and seated firmly and problem solved. :)I actually love the thing, I use it at least once or twice/week and I'm still finding more uses. even on sale that's a lot of money so I'm really glad it works for a variety of things! :)"
5.0 out of 5 stars,So easy to use! I make most of my meals in this and you can do ANYTHING in it. I live in a travel trailer - so traditional cooking is difficult. This makes my life easier!
5.0 out of 5 stars,"What can I say, after almost 50 years of cooking, this appliance has changed my life.  So easy to use.  It has saved me so many times.  Get home late from work, can still have a beautiful roast chicken in 30 minutes.  Forgot to thaw out chicken breasts...no problem.  Two pounds of frozen chicken breasts are cooked fork tender in 20 minutes.  I have purchase this item over and over again for my grown up children, friends, and even my boss."
1.0 out of 5 stars,"Purchased in November, only used for 2 months, as of yesterday, will not work at all. Really think item should last longer than two and a half month's"
5.0 out of 5 stars,Just WOW!  Not the pressure cooker of old where you took your life in your own hands when you became impatient.  Not only does this have more built in safety features it has many great cooking/warming features that I have yet to explore.  I made a chicken enchilada soup recipe using raw chicken about 35 minutes and the chicken was so tender it was easy to shred using a fork.I look forward to using all of the options this Multi-Functional Pressure Cooker has to offer and many years of use.  Would definitely recommend for the beginner like me to someone who is more advance in culinary skills.
5.0 out of 5 stars,Been on the fence about this for two years before deciding to purchase. The price at first stalled my decision until changes in my day to day routine caused me to rethink on how I spend my budget on groceries and meals for the week. This is a cost effective product that will not only save you time but help you think of ways to stretch every penny when making food.  So happy I decided to buy this.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love this pressure cooker. Meal prep time has gone down by at least half hour every time. I mainly do chicken, potatoes and a veggie, like green beans or broccoli. I love how the pressure cooker leave the food juicy, not dried out. Absolutely love it and highly recommend! I got it on Prime Day, so the deal was unbeatable."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I cannot rave enough about the Instant Pot. At first, I thought it would just be an extra small kitchen appliance gathering dust on my counter. But I was SO wrong...this is amazing! It's much better than the old school pressure cookers I've seen my mom use. The insert is super light so easy to clean. And everything cooks so fast! I use this to make lentil soup, garbanzo beans, all kinds of chicken (chicken breast strips, chicken drumsticks), You can just program the Instant Pot and step away to do whatever you need to do - no babysitting the pot on the stove. It makes eating healthier so much easier! I'm able to make lots of protein heavy dishes so I can keep up on my low-carb/high-protein diet."
2.0 out of 5 stars,Honestly the only reason I upgraded To the Insta Pot brand from a knock off brand is because everybody raved about how great the Insta Pot was. I have frankly not been that impressed. My screen keeps shutting off in the middle of cooking because the cord doesn’t fit tightly. My venting for the air pressure has already broke off and it broke off while I was wiping it down with a dishcloth after using it.  Now I can’t even use it and I have had it less then 6 months. Disappointing for the amount of money that they want for this product.
5.0 out of 5 stars,After hearing all the stories around InstaPot we finally decided to purchase one when our Aroma Rice Cooker broke after 8 good years. Does a great job...
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love this pressure cooker. I have had it a few weeks and use it probably an average of 6-7 times a week so far. I took it camping and my friends in next two camp sites fell in love with it too and wound up buying one each! I should get a commission! :-)Things I have made include the most amazing beef stew, pulled pork, fajitas, steel cut oatmeal, easy peel FRESH hard boiled eggs, chicken soup, and an incredible creamy and delicious cheesecake! I plan on yogurt next week and seriously love this thing! Easy to use and clean. You won't be sorry with this purchase."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"One of the best purchases you'll ever make. Pressure cookers can scare people, with good reason. This one is safe and makes me feel safe, unless a person acts like an idiot that is. Love that it's multi-functional. Can truly make one pot meals sauteing then pressure cooking or even slow cooking. Tenderizes meat like you wouldn't believe. Settings displayed are pretty much self-explaining. Always remember to SHUT the VENT when pressure cooking. First pot roast was steamed before pressurized. That's right, I was acting like an idiot!. Read directions thoroughly and if you don't understand something, come to their web site and ask them or other users. Can't say enough good about this machine. Truly, you get the bang for your buck and a little extra time with the family!!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love my instant pot. It was a wedding gift and we use it quite frequently. It is fairly easy to clean the main pot. Sometimes it is a little difficult to clean the crevasses around the pot. I love that it cooks chicken fairly quickly.  Overall, this is a great kitchen appliance."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"Love this pot, used at least 4x/week. Recipes usually are for the larger 6 quart so it took some time to get used to making the right adjustments. Ended up buying the 6 quart too and use that exclusively now."
3.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased this as a gift for someone else who requested it so I can't really give it a proper rating. The giftee has told me that they have used it and it works quite well. Knowing their culinary standards, this is definitely high praise. I CAN say it was a great deal, pricewise!"
1.0 out of 5 stars,I’m never going to use this so I returned it - I know everyone loves their instapot but I just felt it wasn’t going to be used.
4.0 out of 5 stars,"I use this cooker almost every day. All is fine.  I did not rate 5 stars because of a function I'd like to have  missing on the panel.  I wish to have on the panel  a function button for me to manually set the cooking during time which is a standard function button on other pressure cookers I used before. ( I did not pay attention to the availability of a manual  time setting function when purchasing this - taking it for granted).  Other than, the cooker is of good quality, easy to use and safe."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"We got this second pot since we love our 6 qt pot so much.  We found from time to time, we wanted to cool meals with options like using rice for some of the family.  Also, the smaller size helps when you don’t need so much food.  This is also our main pot for cooking poached eggs in.  This product rocks"
5.0 out of 5 stars,I was super jealous when a friend was telling me about her Ninja Foodi and being able to roast and air fry in it. This lid is a game changer! So glad I didn’t go out and replace my instapot! I made a perfect whole chicken with it first thing; the meat was juicy and delicious and the skin was perfectly golden and crisp.
4.0 out of 5 stars,I use this cooker all the time.  It's very versatile.  You can whip up a meal in no time.  The pressure cooker saves a ton of time when cooking tough meat and vegetables.  The pressure release system could use a better design as it is easy to get burned when you release the pressure - as opposed to a lengthy pressure cool down.  The inner pot is a little hard to get totally cleaned and the lid gasket seems to retain the odor of whatever you cook in it.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought this as a gift because I love my own Instant Pot so much.  I use it mostly for pressure cooking, but it's also a rice cooker & slow cooker.  I use it for making easy hard boiled eggs, soup, rice, steel cut oats, beans, grits, yogurt, and lots more.  You can even cook chicken straight from the freezer.  I also have a large stove-top pressure cooker but prefer this because you don't have to pay attention to it while it cooks."
1.0 out of 5 stars,"works great, makes good food, I even forgot to set out a steak and this had it a good medium in 15ish mins from frozen. its only good for single people or couples making smaller meals. the basket for the 6qt is tiny. the coating on the airfryer basket comes off very easily, after the second or third use it had already started peeling off, I am sending it back as defective."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I LOVE my instant pot, it makes dinner time so much more easy and convenient! It can be a little intimidating to use at first but it’s easy to get comfortable with"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I’m obsessed with my instapot. It is truly my favorite Christmas gift ever. Between this and my air fryer, I have never had such a zest for cooking. Rice comes out perfectly fluffy, my lentils and curry cook extremely well. Just make sure you don’t fill it up too much if you are cooking stew or something because it WILL SPRAY out of the top like Shamu the whale, but alas, that was my fault."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great size, easy to use. I've made a ton of dishes with this. It's basically changed my life and I love cooking with it. I've made Korean Spicy Beef, Chicken Vindaloo, Beef and Guinness Stew, Italian Beef Sandwiches, and even Chicken Wings. Love it."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"My favorite thing in the kitchen now. I use the Instant Pot for most of my meals and I haven't screwed anything up yet. I mostly use the pressure setting because I wait for the last minute and have no patience, but the slow cooker function seems to work as well as my old dedicated slow cooker. Rice function works as expected. The saute function gets hot fast, again, I wait until the last minute so this is great.The unit is easy to clean. The lid has retained a few smells, even after cleaning the sealing ring and all removable pieces, but it doesn't bother me so I haven't tried too hard to get rid of it. This was the best purchase I made when moving into my new apartment.Warning to cat lovers though, my cat is terrified of the sound of the pressure releasing!"
2.0 out of 5 stars,"Yeah this is lame..even when followed exactly, at best, my rice cooker is better."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"My wife and I were used to a crockpot waiting 6-8 hours for it to be ready. We were super apprehensive about making the switch because “it can’t be as good in that little time” mentality, we were wrong, it’s just as good. This is definitely worth the buy and such a time saver"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great product, highly recommend. I’d also recommend buying the egg rack if you enjoy hard boiled eggs. They peel easy after being pressure cooked & it allows 14 eggs to be cooked at a time."
5.0 out of 5 stars,The Instant Pot has saved me from 8 weeks of fast food meals while a family member was in the hospital because I can have a meal cooked in the time it took to get ready to go. Unlike crock pots I can have a slow cooked meal in a fraction of the time and without having to be home all day while dinner cooks.Eggs cooked in the shell peel so much easier than boiled - the shell slips right off even with fresh from the farm eggs.I also love that there is a large enough group of people who use the Instant Pot that there are many Facebook groups dedicated to giving recipe ideas and can help with a variety of questions.I love it so much I bought two more as gifts.
1.0 out of 5 stars,"I’m so sad my instant pot came like this. Box was opened, damaged and clumsily taped together, and the instant pot itself was damaged beyond imagine. I can’t believe a product like this made it out the doors! I was so excited to try a pressure cooker but I’m just extremely disappointed instead."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"My boyfriend wanted this for Christmas and I rolled my eyes back into my skull.  Ugh we already have a rice cooker and a slow cooker and the pressure cooker you had you never used so we got rid of it.  Really one more gadget?Well I bite my tongue.  We got rid of the huge rice cooker, the enormous slow cooker and use this now for everything!  Seriously, we use it 2-3 times a week.  We started eating paleo too and it makes the fastest, most delicious, amazing bone broth and the best soup.  You can saute vegetables in it too.  If I was a college student living in a dorm this is the only cooking device  I would need and way better than cooking ramen noodles in my coffee pot!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my new favorite kitchen tool! We have been enjoying real food cooked fast with this baby. I eat a Paleo diet and the Instant Pot has been a life saver for when I'm hungry and need something quick to avoid the tempting high carb fix. My husband and sons love the soups and stews I am now able to create in a matter of minutes. I was scared of having a pressure cooker in my home until I read all of the fabulous reviews of Instant Pot. I've cooked turkey breasts, sweet potatoes, white potatoes, and boiled eggs with great success and in half the time. Loving the boiled broth it has helped me achieve in far less time than other methods. This was a Christmas gift to myself and I'm thrilled to say everyone in my household is just as happy with this purchase as I am!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,Makes enough for a family of three. Made some chili and a lentil stew and both were tasty and took less cooking time than conventional cooking
5.0 out of 5 stars,"The first Instant Pot that was delivered to my home was terribly damaged, box and all.  I am not sure why it was delivered when it looked like a fork lift ran into it. Within a week, a new Instant Pot arrived.  It functions as expected. I would suggest to read the instructions while learning how to use the Instant Pot at its full potential. I do not love pasta dishes made in the Instant Pot, but I am still tweaking recipes and not giving up. The meat has been awesome. Anything from a whole chicken, to boneless ribs for pulled pork, and pot roast has turned out great. I wouldn't hesitate to buy this again."
5.0 out of 5 stars,I use this at least 3 times a week. Such tasty food so fast. Easy enough my kids can dump and cook anything I’ve prepped in the freezer. From frozen chicken to chili or tacos in minutes! I love making beans in this thing too. We make yogurt for smoothies once a week it’s just so versatile.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"The best thing in our kitchen! I was nervous to use a “pressure cooker” at first, but the safety features on this are amazing and we use this all the time. All. The. Time. It’s super easy to use and clean. I also definitely take advantage of the 8 million YouTube videos on tips and recipe ideas (there are also tons of Facebook groups)."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Good, solid product. Took a little longer to ship and receive than expected, but a good product.As for the type of product - the electric, programmable steam cooker: Make sure to research what types of recipes and meals you can make with an pressure cooker like this.  Some recipes require a lot of prep or steam release time - which can take away any time saved in cooking.  I bought it because the ladies on my Facebook feed love theirs - but for us, there didn't turn out to be any time savings."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"OH MMMM GEEE. Seriously, how have I survived all these years without this? It's gotten to the point ( and running joke) to make everything in this. Ribs? Instant pot! Cheesecake? Instant pot! Ice tea? Instant pot. Yogurt? Instant pot! You get the idea! The 8qt is perfect for me. I cook for large crowds so this helps cut down on time in the kitchen drastically. Don't hesitate, just get it!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love!!! Omg so happy I got this!!! I was scared after seeing the tv show ""This is us"" when one of these burned down the house. This has so many safty features it would be very difficult to even burn your food! and is NOTHING LIKE I thought. Its easy to use and makes dinner quick to prepare!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,I am a 30 year old female that lives alone so cooking for me is hard to do with portion control in mind when it comes to produce and meal planning. I can literally throw whatever produce I have that needs to get used up in this and have food for a week. So easy. So delicious. It makes me feel like a pro.
5.0 out of 5 stars,Ok so I purchased this for my wife as a gift since she's asked for one for about 1.5 years. I wish I bought it sooner! I've used it twice and it worked amazing! I made pull apart beef roast in 45 min and fall off the bone baby back ribs is 30. Amazing how easy this is  to use and how well it works. Also is well made and easy to clean. Awesome buy!
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Seriously THE BEST THING that has ever been added to my kitchen. After some practice and research, this has been a time saver and a staple in our kitchen. You can cook just about anything in it! (I would suggest Pinterest and Facebook groups for recipes) I set it before we head to the gym and we have a hot meal ready when we get home. AMAZING! You absolutely need this in your life!PS - We are a family of 4 and are fans of left overs for lunch the next day. I'd recommend getting the larger size!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"What can you say - Its an Instant Pot. Great quality, great product. I bought the 8 qt and can not imagine getting anything smaller. My husband and I like to make large batches so we can eat leftovers or share with our family. It does cut a huge profile though. Love it and have used it nonstop since we bought it 3 weeks ago."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Bought this on Black Friday and haven't looked back. I know I'll still use my oven for things like baking bread, but my IP has earned a permanent place on my counter. Everything from the mundane (boiled eggs that practically peel themselves) to the heavenly (cheesecake and bourbon chicken) are so fast and easy. I think my favorite part is the fact that once I get a recipe cooking, I can just walk away. Great for busy day dinners. And clean-up is a breeze. Although I got it on sale on Black Friday, I honestly believe that it's a steal at full price."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my second Instant Pot and it was bought so that I could make multiple things at once.  It's the perfect size for making side dishes, yogurt etc.  It is quite small but good for a second IP or for those who do not have a lot of storage."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love my instant pot! I am a terrible cook and this has made it possible for me to feed my family home cooked meals instead of take out... serisously. It won't save you ""time"" per se but you are able to walk away and get other stuff done while your food cooks. So it actually does save time if you look at it that way. I love that I don't have to babysit the stove for food that turns out under/over cooked. A++"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Finally became inoperable after 3 years of extensive use (blinking red led's/not heating up).  Will troubleshoot more, but just wanted to throw it out - that this is so worth it.  As a matter of fact, buying another one today!  Note: paid $152.00 three years ago, but today, it's $79.00."
3.0 out of 5 stars,"We used the Duo only for cooking rice and nothing else. It worked well for close to five years. It stopped working one day - we hear a constant ticking noise, probably the bottom heating element popping up and down.Filing a support ticket was of no use, as we havn't heard from them. It was good while it lasted, but we hate throwing this in the trash. I wish they provided support to repair the instant pot."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought a previous model 5 years ago, and I had used a lot. Now, I decided to replace the old one. This Instant Pot model fits perfect.  Recommended."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love this pot. The only problem I had was with putting the lid on. I  got i, but it took a minute."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've wanted an air fryer for a while, but didn't really have a place to store it. When I saw this lid, I jumped on it. Since then, I've used it to cook almost daily. It's very easy to use, takes up minimal space and is a good addition to my IP."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is a perfect appliance for any kitchen. I use this for everything. After a long of work, it hard to cook in my stupid coil stove. And since I bought this, my life became simpler and easier. I use this for everything. Its very simple and powerful."
5.0 out of 5 stars,Love it. Perfect for single dude.
2.0 out of 5 stars,I only used my instant pot about a dozen times over the course of the 15 months I had this before it died. All lights flashing indicating a pressure problem.  Very disappointed.
5.0 out of 5 stars,It took us a while to jump on the bandwagon but we couldn’t pass up the amazing price on Black Friday!  We are a family of 5 and often have guests visit from out of town so the 8qt seemed to make more sense for us.  This thing is huge!  I honestly think the 6qt would have been fine but no regrets.  We’ve used it to make soup twice now and was easy enough to follow the directions.  We’re looking forward to finding more recipes online- I’d love to try a cake in it!  Will update once I do :).
3.0 out of 5 stars,"I HAVE BEEN TRYING TO USE THIS IP AND HAVE HAD TO THROW OUT FOOD BECAUSE I QUESSED WRONG.  PLEASE SEND ME THE USERS MANUAL AND ANY PAPER WORK THAT SHOULD HAVE COME WITH MY PURCHASE.  I HAVE BEEN TELLING FRIENDS ABOUT ELECTRIC PRESSURE COOKERS.  I HAVE ANOTHER BRAND IN A 6 QUART AND FOODS TURN OUT GREAT, IT CAME WITH A MANUAL.  PLEASE, PLEASE!!!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I use this for everything! I was afraid of cooking and this made everything so simple. It is so easy to use. I've done ribs, stews and Sancocho Domicano in a fraction of the time, flans, pasta, even habichuelas con dulce... you name it."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have used this item to make several dishes. Soups, stews, and even a cake. I find that it does these things very well and for a lower cost than the multi program units. Most recipes instructions are this long at this pressure setting and haven't really said anything about auto features. As with all cooking variances in materials and quantities makes a difference. So I haven't been using auto settings."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Everyone says get an insta pot you will love it blah blah blah.... Well ya know what? I be darned if those people weren't 100% right lol the dang thing is just amazing, ribs in 30 minutes instead of 3 hrs... Hells yes sign me up lol I haven't even gotten to really get into all of the possibilities but I know im going to be one happy cooker and probably quite a bit heavier lol"
5.0 out of 5 stars,I cook only for myself and I wanted something small for small sized meals  and one that I could keep on my counter  This 3 qt has totally fit the bill  I used it same day that it arrived and 3 times since  It is great  So glad you came out with a mini that does everything the bigger ones do I am enjoying looking for new recipes all the time and I would surely recommend this mini model  You will be amazed and not disappointed
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is a wonderful product and I don't have to know how to boil water to use it!! We are experimenting with it aboutthree times a nite and cannot get enough of the food the simplicity the sleek and logical design and the timesaving !! I could just ""eat"" this thing up!!lolol"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I finally decided to bite the bullet and upgrade to an Instant Pot. I have an Elite pressure cooker that was working fine, but didn't have all the extra features, such as, yogurt and saute. Boy am I kicking myself for not doing it sooner.Usually when we PCS for the military, we're without our household goods for a month or more. I plan on taking the instant pot with us instead of packing a few pans to get us by. The convince of being able to cook fast, easy meals in a hotel will be well worth the expense of the IP."
2.0 out of 5 stars,"Missing instruction manual so I contacted the manufacturer and had it emailed to me. Instructions hard to follow. Tried making yogurt, instructions too vague for many things. Read online other buyers expressed same concern.i found an elechomes rep online, even she was confused by instructions. It seemed to be written by someone who is not fluent in English. The pressure button didn't work properly. Too much guess work with this brand, although it steamed my vegetables beautifully. I returned this item and it appears to be unavailable now."
1.0 out of 5 stars,"This piece of garbage started giving me ""BURNED"" on the display shortly after STARTING to cook anything (after 8 weeks)! Now I can't trust it because I don't know the extent of what is wrong, only that IT IS MALFUNCTIONING! I used it very little and followed all instructions meticulously. I would not recommend this product to anyone, regardless of how popular it is. My brother's Instant Pot gave out, too. If there had been a reasonable ""return time window"" the purchase would have been a decent decision. Alas, I was unaware that a shockingly short return period could accompany such a well-known and successful product. I have learned my lesson."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love the instant pot! This works great for a family. I also make hard boiled eggs in it very easily! It dreally ea cut down on cooking time. One thing I did not realize is a recipe says cook for 10 min, it's not done in 10min you have to wait for the pot to come to pressure then it cooks forn10 min. It's still quicker than a crock pot or oven but my husband says it should be called the "" in a little bit pot"" instead of instant pot. :-) all in all I love it and think it's great for a busy family. I can't wait to try out more recipes!"
4.0 out of 5 stars,The 8 qt is huge from outside but a good sized inside for a family of 4 or more.  Haven't used it yet aside from the initial water test so can't speak to how it cooks or holds up.Disappointed that the lid had a scuff mark on it and the measuring cup that came with it was broken. For the kind of money this cost I would have expected things not to be broken/damaged.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"My wife loves using this thing. I guess certain recipes it does make things faster, I dont really notice. I do notice cleanup is easier/quicker. Seems like just a fancy crock pot/pressure cooker to me but all the different functions and things you can do with it, it can pretty much replace several older appliances/utensils for just one saving storage/cabinet/counter space."
5.0 out of 5 stars,I love my IP! I wish I would have purchased this a year ago which is how long I have been debating on rather it was worth the money. It IS worth every penny! We've saved so much money by using the IP. The main problem we have is it makes so much good food that we end up with lots of left  overs and run out of room in the fridge. That's a good problem to have. Most of the food I've prepared in this make great left overs so we take a few days to finish eating left overs. I recommend the cookbook Great Food Fast. This will help you cook great meals after you've practiced with the water test and hardboiled eggs.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This Instant Pot lives up to the hype! There are a ton of recipes on the net. The only problem I've experienced so far is that it has a hot spot and has burned the rice twice now. I used the rice setting and guess I should use the manual timer next time. Other than that, I am very happy with it."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Absolutely In love. I bought a DUO Plus 60 and a DUO 80. I use them both all the time. They both do all the functions. One advantage to having two is that on the weekend I can be making dinner in the DUO 60, and in the DUO 80, I can be making a freezer meal for a few weeks down the road. My husband and I both travel and are busy a lot, so this is a huge advantage for us both. Now if I can only get him to realize that these Instant Pots are user-friendly, I would be in heaven."
1.0 out of 5 stars,"There were good instructions on how to set up the cooker. Since I read about the item being arriving damaged, then outer part of the cooker and the hooks on the inside of the lid, I checked this out first. However, upon cleaning the item, I failed to see the cracked bottom portion of the item. very disappointed, was hoping I would not fall in the category of the other buyers :("
5.0 out of 5 stars,"My eyes have been opened with this pressure cooker.  Its an item that makes you wonder why and how you made it this far without one.  I use this with the cookbook ""Great Food Fast"", with pretty good results. Food truly taste great, and it is faster.  Since getting this I have used my slow cooker way less, me not being a plan ahead type person, a pressure cooker fits my lifestyle better.  The only thing I have to say is that there is a 3-5 min extra cooking time for all recipes due to the time it takes to pressurize once you set it.  Still is a winner in my book"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I adore my instant pot. Ribs, mashed potatoes, refried beans, hard boiled eggs, rice, yogurt...everything I've made in it has turned out wonderfully well. Except for sushi rice...I still haven't been able to figure out the right amount of steam time for perfect sushi rice. But brown rice, basmati, jasmine and sticky rice for regular meals turn out great.It does take a bit of time for the pot to heat up before the pressure cooking actually begins, but once it's under pressure the thing cooks fast!Since purchasing mine I have bought Instant Pots for some of my friends. I highly recommend this product."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is a game changer for quick & nutrition meals. Now I understand why my grandma always used her pressure cooker. It keeps chicken breast juicy, it infuses your meals with more flavor using less seasoning. I am very happy with my order, I wish I had gotten it sooner."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I like this so far, but there’s definitely a learning curve. I need to watch more instant pot specific recipes to get used to times and measurements. I’ve made two meals so far without much issue"
5.0 out of 5 stars,I really love my Instapot Duo. Its quick no heating up the kitchen and not alot of dishes 🙂
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm naturally hesitant when it comes to buying things ' as seen on tv' but this one knocked it out of the ballpark. So far I have used it in every way shown in the ads and it has performed like a champion. For quick food that you can actually eat w/out the guilt of takeout it's perfect. Cleans up like a dream , even if the bottom gets accidentally burned in a bit. The instructions are quite good, and it performs as advertised. If it makes it for the long haul I'd say this was a good purchase."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"French fries came out great, no oil residue.  Other food is great if you follow cooking directions. Must learn how to use it prior to cooking."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Well, that is what my sister-in-law says and everyone we know is crazy about this instant pot pressure cooker thing. So we gave in the moment we saw that it was on sale :).. Even had our first meal the night we got it! Crazy how things can cook super fast under pressure; science! Anyways, already have a cake pan and silicone molds in my next order cart :) Why not!?"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm in love with this product! I'm still experimenting with some of the settings, but I've made hard boiled eggs (which came out perfect both times, and I am absolutely terrible at making them on the stove), made rice and quinoa, slow cooked some meatballs, made bone broth and soup, and pressure cooked some amazing chicken. I'm so so happy with this purchase and look forward to using it for many years!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I totally love this product.  I asked others about it, and was shocked at how many people I know have one.  It is absolutely great.  Kind of a learning curve to use it but the food has turned out great and I love how little clean up there is.  Cooks food so much faster.  I did have an issue with a recipe I used.  I think the menu was too many servings for my pot.  When venting the gravy was venting too, not just steam. Messy but I caught it with paper towels as it vented.  Be careful not to fill it too full.  I have used the settings pressure cooker and slow cooker and saute.  Can't wait to continue more recipes.  Pinterest is an excellent spot to go to for recipes for the Instant Pot."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I hate to cook and am not very good at it.  My husband is the far better cook in our home.  I have used this at least once a week, often twice, since it arrived just after Thanksgiving.  There is a slight learning curve, but I have been very happy with the results and the real cook in this family is also pleased with it.  Since we are eating at home more, this is saving time and money."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love this thing! Best purchase of 2019 by far! I work a lot and sometimes forget to lay something out or soak beans and this thing saves me all the time. Cooking beans I didn't soak or cooking frozen chicken quickly, I love it. I am still getting used to it but its amazing and I hope it lasts forever"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love this pot. We use it all the time. Even my husband cooks with it. Great way to prepare meats.  They come out tender, juicy and just perfect. Easy to use and there are tons of recipes online for preparing meals using an Ipot. We highly recommend this Instant Pot."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I absolutely LOVE this Instantpot! I waited for a long time to order one and when this one went on sale I scooped it up. I am so glad that I did!! I was hesitant to use it for the first time but once I did, I can't stop. This is made well, works like it is supposed to, and is worth the money!"
3.0 out of 5 stars,Loved the amount of things that can be prepared in this. Love that it takes less time than preparing it other methods for the most part and that it is so tender. I however do have a complaint about the vent. In non vent position it still splatters from time to time. I have done what instructions say do but still does this while in non vent position. I have three friends with insta pots. 2 of them same model as mine. All 4 pots splatter some while in non vent position and cooking.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought this Instant Pot about a year and a half ago.  We love using it to make ribs, hot wings, yogurt and a lot more.The other day I was in the middle of making my meal when it quit working.  I contacted Instant Pot support, and they quickly got back to me.  They asked me to supply them with different pictures and information, and out of goodwill they are replacing my base at no extra cost. They went above and beyond.  Great customer service."
1.0 out of 5 stars,"After received this instant pot and I opened it after more than a week as I was at the hospital and did not have a much time at home for me to cook but when I opened the package I see that it does not have any Spatula and Measuring Cup in it, all I had was just the cooking pot.This false advertisement and I am extremely disappointed and unhappy with my purchase, will not recommend!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Have been watched YouTube before placing this order, prayed that I would received a new pot without any problems. However I missed the voltage problem. In New Zealand with 230V power supply I can not use this pot.  Although I tried cooking twice without trouble but I stopped. Stainless steel inner pot changed its color (became rainbow color). I wish I have not made damage to this pot. Until I could find a way to fix this issue I would not use it anymore. Thanks for speedy post to New Zealand."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"I have had my IP for 13 months. Came home last week to dinner unfinished and a dead machine. Now I am going through the claims process with Square Trade. So glad I purchased the warranty after reading reviews. (I almost forgot I had the warranty) Love the Instant Pot. Just know that it may not last forever. I take the kids to Tae Kwon Do several nights a week. Load up the IP with goodies and come home to something delicious. Easy, fast, usually healthy. I have been a little lost the past couple of days without it."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"She literally loves this thing to death. Well, death of the last Instant Pot at least. Used it until it burned out, which was like an ungodly amount of meals over 4 yrs. Will continue to buy these things cause they're just great. Don't think. Just buy."
1.0 out of 5 stars,"I was looking forward to using this so much.  Opened the box and was hoping to not have the problems that many others have had.  Well.....I had them.  Dent right on the front.  Not only that but the inner black pot (plastic) somehow popped out of its case and collapsed the whole thing, so it sits sideways.  Really bummed and not real happy with quality for my first experience with Instant Pot.  Didn't get to even use it once."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Used it 15 times so far, from steaming squash to a small turkeys (6-7lbs) Get a cook book! This does not come with much info. I also made hard boiled eggs, they came out perfect and peeled amazing! I have figured out for myself to cut down a few mins on the recipes and check the chicken or turkey before it said too. I saved us from overcooking it. The book I have said after the 20min timer stopped to let it vent slow and give the (whole) chicken 10 mins on low to finish cooking-it was dry. The next time I only went 16mins and fast vented to get the lid off, it was great perfect and right on for temperature. It cooks fast, but it does take time to warm up before the timer starts."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love this thing.  Pressure cooking always scared me but this has made me a believer.  Love how fast eveything cooks!  This is really great for busy families especially if both parents are working 8 hours a day, to get a quick nourishing dinner done in a flash.  Our favorite dish is Chili Lime Chicken, I could eat it every single day!  Also made killer refried beans in this!  The only thing I have not liked so far was the whole chicken, it was more of a stewed chicken so I will use my Showtime Rotisserie for that since we love the crispy skin.  But a lot of days the Instant Pot is a lifesaver and everyone should have one."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I’ve heard everyone raving about the instant pot for a while now, but I am not one to usually jump on fad bandwagon. I’m so glad that I did. This is one of the few times that something has lived up to all of the hype. It has made my life so much easier, and I use it almost every day."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"As a vegetarian, I eat a lot of bean/lentil dishes so it’s great to be able to make these in 40 mins with minimal prep time-just light sautéing and then pressure cook on and able to do something else.  Everything I’ve made in the instant pot from lentil soup to ramen has turned out wonderfully.  Wish I had purchased sooner and not listened to people that said it’s just a pressure cooker."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I won't bore you with another long winded tome of effusive, billowing, praise. The Instant Pot has not revolutionized our lives. It has, however, made certain meals easier to prepare and in some instances improved the taste and/or texture of certain dishes. If you find yourself not thinking ahead as often as I do, the Instant Pot can be your last minute savior. I agree with those who have noted that they find little need for a crock pot. You can get the same results in usually less than an hour. So why plan that far ahead??? We have prepared everything from Korean ribs to fauxtisserie chicken; from a pot of beans to a pot roast and all have turned out pleasing to the palate. You really have to develop a different mind set sometimes to remember you can cook so many things in your IP! Highly recommend it!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"We LOVE our InstandPot and use it nearly every, single day! Steel cut oats in the morning, 7 minute rice for a quick side for lunch and 45 minutes for a half loin of pork roast in the evening, this thing has logged some hours in our home. We have 10 people in our home and the capacity has not disappointed! I have also enjoyed the stainless steel liner that washes so easily, as well as the dishwasher safe sealing ring. I bought another brand of pressure cooker at Target, but returned it because the inner pot was made of teflon/non-stick material. Stainless steel is non-toxic, safter and a breeze to clean.Be sure to find some good facebook groups for recipe ideas and use the manual for cooking times. We will never be without ours, if we can help it!"
4.0 out of 5 stars,When u turn food over it doesn’t shut off. You can’t see ur food. The cooking area is small. Wanted to cook a whole chicken but way too small.It cooks well. I like it.Had fried chicken tonight. Was good.I plan on using it for more things.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This thing is amazingly simple to cook with and cleanup is a breeze as well.. unless you're one of those people who doesn't clean as you go, I am.. so the food never got a chance to dry in the pot, but I suspect it's still pretty simple.  The instructions are user friendly, though so is the cooker itself so one may not even need to read them.. except the warnings of course! Safety first, or you'll steam your eye out! Enjoy.. my fellow humans... enjoy!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm a horrible cook. I don't like it and I'm not good at it. My friend told me about this so I decided to give it a try. You guys? I can't stop cooking. My daughter started feeling sick the other night, so I took  her temperature...fever. Within 30 minutes, I served her homemade chicken noodle soup. I don't even know who I am anymore. BUY THIS."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Very good quality, easy to use and serves meals faster than anything else on the market.Cooked first meal today with it (Chicken in BBQ sauce) and we had a great dish in 15 minutes! Comes with everything you need, even a few useful recipes Easy to clean too, definitely worth the price (the 30% off helped but would have bought it at full price!)You may want to buy the book:""Dinner in an Instant"" by Melissa Clark. All recipes are made for it.Highly recommendable"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Have used this product for 8 months now. All I can say is this is a MUST HAVE for your kitchen. I can throw 4 frozen chicken breast along with frozen veggies in and 20 min later everything is done. Cannot best this product for time, convenience and taste/flavor. Do yourself a favor and buy this right now. We first purchased the 6Q but returned for the 8Q. The 6Q was too small to feed multiple people"
5.0 out of 5 stars,I rated cleaning on the fact that I bought a nonstick ceramic pot so its really easy.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Don't use the recipes in the book that comes with it.  They are missing many details and I had a very poor outcome with a roast.  Just do ""Instant Pot Recipies"" search online (Duck Duck Go is private!).So very easy and very few pots and pans to clean after a big meal is cooked.  Love this thing.  Have had it several months now."
5.0 out of 5 stars,I love this pot. Easy to use and clean up is a breeze. Haven't had a bad meal yet. Wife now refuses to cook since I have become so proficient at using the pot. Makes fall off the bone spareribs. Pot roast dinner can be made in less than one hour. No need to cook all day in a slow cooker.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"There's not much I can say that thousands of others haven't said. It's awesome. If you're a bachelor like me, ditch the frozen dinners and processed foods and get one of these. So simple and safe to use. There is a bit of a learning curve at first. My first beef stew had just about turned to puree by the time it was finished cooking but the taste was unparalleled nonetheless. The second one I just cut 10 minutes off the time and it was absolutely perfect.Just switching to more fresh foods has really made a difference in my lifestyle and my health. Buy one - You'll love it...!!!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I was skeptical about the Instant Pot trend but I must confess I'm a believer. If you think this will make all things cook faster, you are kidding yourself. It takes a good ten minutes to come to pressure, and even the quick release is another ten minutes, the difference is that it is babysitting free! Set it and walk away, help your kids with their homework, then ding, dinner is done. Worth the investment of time to learn a new way of cooking"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased this last month and started using it right away and so far I haven't been disappointed. I have cooked stews, soups, chicken, pot roast and ribs in it. I have used almost all the features and plan to eventually use them all. I love the speed of the pressure cooker. I was able to cook a 4 pound whole chicken in 35 minutes which when you work 12 hour days is wonderful. My husband and I have switched to a no processed foods diet which makes it really hard to get a good meal when your in a time crunch situation. But with the Instant Pot I am able to do that much easier now. I throw in dinner and deal with other things while it cooks. I have recommended this product to friends and family."
1.0 out of 5 stars,"Used four times successfully. About 30 seconds into using it for the  fifth time, it shut down completely. No heat, no display. Very disappointed. It was a great timesaver when it worked.  Of course I ordered all of the accessories which are useless because i won’t be replacing the pot. An expensive investment for only four meals. Back to my dependable 10 year old crock pot."
5.0 out of 5 stars,Love... best buy... use almost daily... may may not have instructors inside the box I don't know I didn't even bother I went straight to YouTube and watch live YouTube videos and learn how to cook so many items. Pressure cooker Crock-Pot slow cooker steam sauteed it is just super awesome the more you use it the more you fall in love with it.
5.0 out of 5 stars,Love beans and tender beef . This is the way to it in a hurry. This has become more important than the microwave in my kitchen. Bought two more to make dog food in a hurry with bones that crumble in your hand. These things are amazing !!Unlike pressure cookers  of old there is nothing to fear. Stuff it full and walk away.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have an IP and got this one as a gift for my BIL who loves to cook. So far, he is enjoying it. He never used a pressure cooker in the past, so he’s learning the techniques.From now on I don’t need to wonder what gifts he’ll like - I can give him IP accessories."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"I think it is a decent quality product for the money and suits my needs just fine. However I noticed that sometimes, especially when I cook one meal right after another the steam is leaking around the cover and there is no sealing even though I make sure that there are no grains or food pieces between the seal and the pot."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm still getting to grips with the Intant Pot but my experience so far has been most encouraging. I made rice, ragu and a chicken dish. All three turned out perfectly. I was a little nervous at first about using a steam pressure cooker, so I watched one or two YouTube videos by regular owners. This took a lot of the edge off, and made the task more manageable. Another valuable resource is the Instant Pot app, which has many of the most popular recipes 'translated' for use in the Instant Pot. So far, I'm certainly impressed. And as time goes by, I hope to become more comfortable with the product and use it more often."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"So far, I have have had great success with the Instant Pot Duo Nova 7-in-1.  I have been thrilled with rice cooking results--perfect basmati, white long grain rice, brown rice.  I have pressure cooked a black bean soup which came out perfectly from soaked dry beans.  Perfect no fuss polenta in minutes!  Easy to use (after reading and watching you tubes to get started) and easy to clean.  So far so good!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"With the help of the instructions, you tube and google I have successfully prepared rice and a meal in my new 6 qt insta pot.  I think the instructions that come with the insta pot could be a  little more clear, but right now there is so much information on google and you tube you really don't need the instructions.  You definitely need to consider weather to get the 6 or 8 qt.  In my household there are only two of us and the 6 qt is all we need.  One hack I did learn was that when cooking rice  and the pressure released and the pot goes to keep warm all the water is gone and the rice will start sticking to the bottom of the pot.  Any issues I am having now will probably be non-issues in another week.  I love my insta pot."
5.0 out of 5 stars,My wife is making all sorts of vegan and regular meals with it. I dont think I have seen her use the stove since she opened it.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Absolutely love this pressure cooker!  I was concerned because of the negative reviews, but because Chef AJ and other vegan chefs raved about it, I decided to buy it and see, and, have been using it for a couple of months, 3-5x a week.  This is my first pressure cooker and so I was very concerned that I use it correctly and read the manual thoroughly (important). So far I mainly use it to make beans and brown rice.  There is a learning curve to getting the cooking times right for my taste, but once that is achieved, the pressure cooker has proven to be a real time saver and fun to use because I can set it and pretty much forget it.I have a Zojirushi Fuzzy logic rice cooker, which I loved, but, it has two problems - it has a teflon cooking pot and it takes 1 hr and 45 minutes to cook brown rice, just too long! With my new Instant Pot, from start to total cool down, it takes less than an hour (I cook for 26 mins and let cool down naturally 20-30 mins).  Note: If I am in a rush, I use hot water so it takes less time to reach the pressure point.As for the black beans, I used to have to constantly check the texture to get it just right when using the stovetop. Now, I just  set it and forget it.  Although you can make beans without soaking, I have found that the beans are larger and just taste better after a night of soaking before pressre cooking.The most important point is that if something didn't turn out when I first tried it, I adjusted the cooking and resting times. Once I figured that out, it turned out perfect every time. For the rice, I had to reduce the amount of water as I like rice firmer with a chewy texture. Also, I was concerned that the rice would stick to the pot but it hardly sticks. I just soak it for awhile and it is easy to clean. Once in a while I will use Bar Keeper's Friend (stainless steel cleaner) to get rid of the ""cloudy"" stain on the bottom of the pot.So I wonder if most of the people who had issues didn't read the manual thoroughly, as it was pretty good at addressing many issues, which weren't issues for me because I understood how the machine worked.  Bottom line, I am really glad I got this pressure cooker as it has made the cooking part of my life that much easier!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,Great all around product. Have been using mine almost every day for well over a year with no problems! Definitely would buy again!
5.0 out of 5 stars,This little pot is very convenient to cook meals for two. (4 if you really pack it).  Takes up very little counter space.It seems to be a lot safer than traditional pressure cookers and the programs take a lot of the guesswork out of a recipe.I really like it for steaming artichokes...Would definitely buy it again
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm so impressed with how quickly this cooks food, how many options there are, and how soft meats are when cooked in here. The fact that I can cook dry beans in here [without] soaking them was worth the purchase price alone.Tip: For the best chicken soup put a whole chicken in with spices. Take bones out after cooking (they will slip right out of the meat) then add noodles and veggies."
5.0 out of 5 stars,We really didn't know what to do with our Instant Pot until we tried it.  Saw a video on the internet and found how easy it was to make many dishes in it.  We've used it several times and each time has been easy and quick.  Clean-up's a snap because we can lift out the inner bowl and just clean that.  Simple.  Everyone should have one.
3.0 out of 5 stars,I liked some of the features but I realized that most of the functions can be done in my Regular oven. It’s fine if you eat frozen meals all the time but I found that it was not practical for  me or my lifestyle. I had it for less then a month and it stopped working so I returned it.
4.0 out of 5 stars,"So far, I like what I have made with mine. I had been hoping though, that it would make cooking easier, but it is a tad confusing. It is, however, fast. I even made some great hard boiled eggs that tasted very good and shells peeled off so easily."
2.0 out of 5 stars,"Works great when it works. It stopped working almost exactly 1 year after I puchased it, so it is out of warranty. A 6-qt DUO I bought a year prior died after only 3 months (luckily, I guess, because at least Instant Pot honored the warranty). Truly sux because I bought a bunch of silicone gaskets for the mini, and it isn't worth paying for a new one knowing it will die within a year and become landfill."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"When I first heard of the instant pot, I was skeptical on whether this is a good cooker. But ever since I started using it, it was a game changer! I can cook long recipes in a dramatically shorter time period. Definitely has allow me to cook other dishes that I've been wanting to try"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"We use this a lot. High quality. Still figuring out the right water levels on some things. Beans and chilies are always better the second day as leftovers, but you can't beat cooking dry beans in an hour without presoaking. Works great on meats. The flavor is fantastic. Lots of recipes online specifically for the InstantPot. The six liter size is plenty big for a large family (2 adults and 3 to 6 younger kids) even when we have guests over."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"Heavy, stainless steel pot, cast iron housing, best rice maker + pressure cooker!  It could use a start button, cause it’s not certain it has started just be pushing the rice button"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Growing up watching endless infomercials, I was very skeptical prior to purchasing the instant pot. I did my research online watching. Recipe videos online and everything just looked and sounded to good to be true.  I waited about 2 years and just couldn’t convince myself to trust this product.  I finally just went ahead and purchased the instant pot and used it at least 10 times in the first few days of owning it . This product really helped me save time , and makes cooking a breeze. I recommended it to my family and friends and they also love it .  Makes great pasta sauces and soups. I can’t wait to do more with it"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"There is nothing bad to say about this product. Well designed. Multi- functional. Virtually, no other pots and pans to wash.There is a bit of learning curve, but nothing you can't overcome. Just read the manual instruction first and you will ramp up to a great cook pretty quickly.It's fun to cook with Instant Pot because everything turns out delicious at restaurant caliber meals.I recommended to my friend and she bought one and also fell in love with it immediately.  Needless to say, both households cook a lot more at home, which is a very good thing!"
4.0 out of 5 stars,"This is a great improvement over the old stove top pressure cookers we used to use.  It’s very efficient, saves time in the kitchen, and is easy to use, once you experiment a bit. It’s also very safe.  That said, I use the mini 3Qt. almost daily, while the 6 Qt. gets used more for Family or company, or special meals.  It’s more cumbersome than the smaller model, but that’s just a matter of circumstances."
2.0 out of 5 stars,It was convenient when it worked. Granted I’ve had it for a while but it was used 2-3 times a year. It occupied too much space on my counter so I left it in the pantry for months. The problems started when it kept turning off with the sauté feature then today it’s giving me a C6 error.Not sure I want to go through the trouble of contacting their support channels and certainly do not want to purchase another unreliable product. Buyers beware!
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Cooks super fast. I had a pot of Jasmine rice that usually takes 30 minutes easily, and this turned it to mush in 5 minutes. Took trial and error to figure out cooking times. I come home from work, throw chicken and potatoes in it, jump in the shower quick, and it's done, and fall apart tender by the time I'm done."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Get it. Just do it. You won't regret it. Do it now. There is nothing you can regret about this purchase. So many good food options, so easy to use and so incredibly quick! I made an amazing pot roast that my entire family loved in 2 hours with maybe 15-20 minutes of prep work."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I can't live without it anymore. Soups, pastas, rice, potatoes, oatmeal...so much more. Everything is fast and with less dishes to wash. My slowcooker never got used much but this I use several days a week. Strongly recommend it for people who want to save time."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"not quite as big as i thought based on a relative's IP that I used, but still totally adequate for my needs.  i've never had a problem with the size or the function.  has totally revolutionized my menu, as i can easily make chili or stew to freeze in smaller servings to eat in a bind.  Love that i don't have to defrost meat before cooking, and that there's only ONE pot to clean after."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"It's a nice product, with a good interface and seems like it's well constructed. But if you've never used a pressure cooker before, you might be surprised by how long it actually takes to cook something. In addition to prep and cook time, add a good 15 minutes or so for the thing to pressurize, then another 15 at least for it to depressurize if you don't use the venting valve. I have to laugh at their recipe booklet's ""1-minute quinoa"" recipe... there's no way you're getting anything out of that pot in one minute, and you're not getting it out in the cooking time of any other recipe either. But it is a set-it-and-forget-it appliance, though, so this is far from a deal-breaker, just fair warning."
5.0 out of 5 stars,This is such a great product! I’ve given one to each of my children and two of my friends and they’re loving it too! I just did baby back ribs for 20 minutes (use your favorite rub) and in the oven (with barbecue sauce) at 450° for 15 minutes. They were amazingly delicious and sooo tender!  My husband was impressed!!
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have had this Instant Pot for about 60 days now and yet to get a bad meal from it.  Even chicken fingers that used to be all dried out come out ""fork cutting"" tender.  Directions are good and to the point, and the cook books are helpful as well.  Along with the tips from the internet, this has replaced several cooking items and results in less mess and easy clean up.  And it has the won the wife approval which is all the counts. LOL..."
1.0 out of 5 stars,"If you want mediocre, canned tasting food quickly, then this is for you.  We wanted to like this, but it takes good ingredients and makes them taste like canned food.  Very disappointing.  Looking at the reviews, people prefer quickness over taste."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"OH!MY!!GAWD!!!Why didn't I get this sooner!!? I've used this many times since I purchased it. I'm still discovering the things I can cook in it. I love that I don't have to buy canned beans EVER again! :) This Instant Pot thing is da bomb! Seriously. I've never been ""scared"" of them, but never understood just how much time it would save me. My mom, on the other hand, was still skeptical of the technology, but she's seen it in action and is now convinced that it is a NECESSARY tool in our kitchen! I did a lot of reading and homework before finally deciding to purchase this one. Money was not the factor as I was willing to spend the money on my investment. I looked on QVC and several other sites and still came back to THIS ONE! It has a handy manual with recipes that are pretty basic, but once you get the hang of it you will see that the pot is really quite easy to use and you can alter the recipes to your own taste. :) If you're on the fence about trying it, jump already!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I was very hesitant to use a pressure cooker as I had heard so many stories about them exploding. After using this, I don’t know why I didn’t get it sooner! It cuts my cook time in half and the meals come out amazing. Only thing I wish it came with was a little cookbook. I have to rely on Pinterest for recipes."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I really like the pressure cook function. My grandmother always used an old fashioned pressure cooker, but I was always afraid to use one because of the hot steam. The Instant Pot kid won’t even open until the steam is released and the food has cooled some. It feels very safe. I prepared a “falling apart” corned beef for my guests in less than two hours while we chatted and had appetizers. I think two guests ordered Instant Pots from Amazon immediately!"
1.0 out of 5 stars,I should have just bought an air fryer.  The inner bin you have to use is so small you can barely do a couple pieces of food before it's full.  The list of things that are disappointing about this product would exceed my characters allowed in this post.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is the most life changing purchase I've made in YEARS! I use it almost every other day. My family, like most, is extremely busy during the week, and I realized I was spending a fortune on crappy fast food. I thought this would help save money while allowing us to eat healthier because I would actually have time to cook, and I was right! I started out by making some of my ""specialties."" I figured that would be the best and biggest test. So I made chicken and dumplings, baby back ribs (browned in the broiler after cooking), and chicken noodle soup. All three came out perfectly and soooo fast! Even better than stove top or oven. I even threw some rock solid, frozen chicken breasts in there and used them to make amazing buffalo chicken dip. Saved me $5 that I would have normally spent on a rotisserie chicken to make the dip. Also makes great hard boiled eggs with no worries about the shell sticking. It's super easy to use and clean, and would be great for expert chefs, beginners, or people in the middle like me.I always wanted a pressure cooker, and now I am in LOVE. I'm sure this will pay for itself pretty soon. I don't know how I lived without it!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,oh my god this thing is awesome!Instead of using a slow cooker to cook something for hours and hours you can get the same result in under an hour.now - if that's not enough to convince you to buy this thing it also can be used in slow cooker mode and you can slow cook for 6+ hoursor you can use it in rice-cooker mode to make perfectly cooked riceor you can use it to steam vegetablesThe fact that you can literally use this to replace your slow cooker plus do other stuff is awesome - I hate buying more gadgets but this one totally replaces your slow cooker and does more.
3.0 out of 5 stars,S just got pot on black Friday. I am afraid it must have been a refurbished being passed off as new. Cant cook any of the instant pot recipes I got with it without getting BURN message. I have tried several. The only way it seems to work is if you add a whole bunch of extra liquid and not use it to do any saute part of a recipe. You really will need to use extra cooking pots to get a meal done. I got the 6 qt so maybe that is the problem. Very disappointing and would not buy again. I will be returning.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"My favorite thing to cook in! So much that this one I purchased for a friend expecting their second child! I love to premake meals and just throw them in from the freezer. I suggest if you like to meal prep, purchase a container that is roughly the same size to freeze in so you don’t have to defrost before cooking."
5.0 out of 5 stars,I love this instant pot so much.  I love all of the different features it has on it from a crock pot to a instant pot.  You can even hard boil eggs in three minutes and they turn out perfectly.  It is easy to use and easy to take apart and clean.  Such a wonderful additional to my kitchen appliances.
1.0 out of 5 stars,I cant return this. I was given 1 month of retuning it but it worked fine at that point. It has been used for the past 2.5 months. I tried to use it today and it will not seal. We have tried three times to cook our chicken and when the food is done there is no steam. Cooked for 13 minutes three times and our fresh chciken was still pink.
5.0 out of 5 stars,Makes your Instant Pot even better! Would definitely recommend it. Love the broil option which works so quickly compared to oven method.  Only negative is that batches are small due to food space limitations.
4.0 out of 5 stars,"These are very good cookers, I have purshased 3, one for me and 2 as gifts.The last one I received was dented. Although I know that shipping damage is beyond the sellers control, the box was not damaged so I think it happened at the manufactures.They are very good products and I decided to keep the dented product to avoid the return hassle. If you want to save a lot of time, their product does an excellent job"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I’ve used a stove top 6 quart pressure cooker for years. What I love about my new 8 quart Instant Pot is:*Easy to pull out the stainless steel pot to serve and clean, much easier to clean than a heavy cooker without an inside pot.*No adjusting a stove top electric or gas burner to keep an even pressure.*There’s no noisy rocking and hissing of a “wobbler” on the top cover—very, very slight hissing, very quiet.Keep in mind that you can only fill the pot to the 2/3 mark. You might need a larger size than first thought."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"Love it when I got the nerve to use it, food tastes so good and quick spare ribs mmm. Why I didn't give five stars the manual a lot to be desired but watching you tube and Facebook page helped a lot. Would highly recommend"
2.0 out of 5 stars,"I clearly should have done more research before purchasing an Instant Pot.  I had no idea that while many recipes will tout 20 or 30 minutes, they don't include the amount of time for natural release that some use.  I wish I had done my research first, instead of spending the money on this."
5.0 out of 5 stars,I am only a week in and I LOVE this thing. I had another brand electric pressure cooker but it broke in my last move. This thing is awesome! I make my dogs homemade food and I love that I can make it in this and be done cooking their food in no time. It made split pea soup in 20 minutes and the soup was so good. A definite must have!
5.0 out of 5 stars,I bought my Instant Pot last year. I absolutely LOVE it. I have made all sorts of things in it and it never fails. I bought 3 more as gifts. I especially like it when it is to hot to turn on the oven. I can still make a good meal and not heat up the whole house. It is a life saver when you forget to take the meat out is the freezer because it can cook the frozen meat without a problem. I think everyone should have one.
2.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought one of these and enjoyed using it five or six times but it then just died for no apparent reason.  I believe I paid for a 4 year warranty although if so it was by mistake as the time needed to collect is no doubt worth more to me than the small cost involved.  I may buy a replacement as I did like the thing while it worked, but its failure is quite disappointing."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great item - saves a lot of time on cooking. Majority of the recipes might be adjusted to be done in the pressure cooker so they take less of your time, it is hard to forget about them and it if possible to start cooking in the evening and the food will be ready for you in the morning.I had a problem with my first item - after a while I got C6 error, so I contacted customer support and they provided me another pressure cooker in a matter of days"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"We were skeptical about getting one of these since we have 2 crockpots and generally like the food cooked in those better. We also didn’t want to add another large appliance in the cabinets. Since buying this, we’ve used it a few times a week and had great results with veggies, rice, and meat. Glad we picked one up on sale."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I haven't even done much in the way of complicated cooking in my Instant Pot and I love it already.  Corn on the cob is easy, perfectly cooked, and puts wayyyyyyy less steamy air into the kitchen than a boiling pot of water.  Same with lobster.  It's a pretty good defroster, too.  I love it so much I've taken it on a couple of vacation trips with me."
5.0 out of 5 stars,This product is amazing! I tell everyone they need this! It can do so much and is one of my go to kitchen gadgets! I have purchased so many expensive kitchen things that never end up getting used (haven’t we all) but this isn’t one of them! I use it multiple times a week and I’ve had this for months! It makes cooking so much easier and it really is amazing!
3.0 out of 5 stars,Actual air fryers work much better. What would take 20 minutes in my old one takes double the time in this one. The basket is also quite small.
3.0 out of 5 stars,"It does what it is supposed to do.  I just am not thrilled with it.  The bottom of the pan got gunky and does not seem to scrub clean and I either need better recipes or something, just feel like the food lacks flavor in here  But it works as intended and if you are into using the Instant Pot go for it.  I am just not a fan of it.  But it does work as intended."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"As a busy college student I needed a kitchen appliance that would relieve me from spending a ton of time in the kitchen. After much research and a recommendation from Michele Tamof Nom Nom Paleo's website, I chose this electric pressure cooker. I am SO happy that I did. I've made some of my best tasting food with this Instant Pot. There is so much you can do with it, it's almost insane. I've made perfectly cooked rice (even got rid of my rice cooker!), stews, and Kalua Pig (Nom Nom Paleo recipe). It really is a set it and forget it type of machine. You don't have to spend a lot of time in the kitchen. What really sold me on the Instant Pot was the stainless steel insert, it's not nonstick (good thing) as they are wear out over time. The insert can be hard to clean at times but well worth the effort. I've had this appliance since September 2015 and have used it 4-5 times a week since then. I highly recommend this Electric pressure cooker.Also, check out Flo Lum on YouTube she makes awesome recipes with the Instant Pot."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This saves so much time, I find myself using it almost everyday either for a main dish in itself or for sides. Literally set it and walk away until it’s done. There are also so many recipes for this exact version of pressure cooker so it is easy to find different meals to make online."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"Love my IP Air Fryer Lid!!  I have been using it a lot.  HOWEVER, the coating on the basket is starting to peel off.  I have seen other reviews with the same comment, but I don't see ANY responses from the company.  I have had an Instant Pot for 6 years, even before they became super popular and can't imagine my life without it, but I really wish the quality of the basket was better.  Or that I could even buy a replacement."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Proper use of the instapot means not filling it up all the way.  With the 8qt, I can make 6qt of stew.  I use the insta pot to make large batches of items I can freeze for lunches.  Everyone should own one of these.  The ability to not have to stand over the stove and stir is wonderful."
1.0 out of 5 stars,"Unfortunately I never got to try it. I bought this item ""USED-IN GOOD CONDITION"" but when I received the package, the box 📦 was really nice unlike the actual instant pot which was dented and broken plastic parts, so I returned it within the hour."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"My new best friend even though I am mostly just impressed with the pressure cooker. My slow cooker works way better than the slow cook function on this. Honestly, I have not tried the other functions on this. Don’t be dazzled by too many functions that you will likely never use. Spend only on the ones you know you will. In hindsight I would have spent way less money."
2.0 out of 5 stars,"My food comes out soggy. Does not work unless you know how to perfectly use the settings. It will take alot of power (look at the voltage). If you are paying for electricity, you shouldnt get this (money wise unless you have the extra $$). You should just steam your vegetables with a pot and a coliander of sorts (depends on portion size). It's not worth the money."
3.0 out of 5 stars,"The quality and durability appear to be great.  The steam valve was malfunctioning where it would not toggle to vent and stay in place. Once the steam was venting, the valve would turn to prevent all the steam from escaping. Then I would have to turn the valve again and hold it in place to vent.  And for that reason I returned the Instant Pot. Has anyone else experienced this problem?"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I put off getting one of these because I didn't want to add another appliance that I barely use to my collection, but after three days I've used this every day, and made some of the best home cooked meals ever.  A recent standout was white beans with chicken broth, white wine and herbs, cooked on the pressure setting for 45 minutes (no soaking) which came out creamy and so flavorful."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Whoever came up with the idea of instant pots deserves sainthood. This has cut my cooking time by 3/4. I have been able to cook a lot of things that would take hours in just minutes, I love ribs but wouldn’t make them because of the cooking time needed, now it’s so easy I treat my family monthly. Love the yogurt setting I make it every week."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love this pressure cooker.  I bought a different brand a few years ago, but didn't use it very much as I just didn't like all the aluminum touching my food.  This one has stainless steel pot and lid both.  The people at instant pot told me the only thing that's not stainless steel is the little pressure thing inside the lid.  This means a lot to me.  Most others I've looked at have an aluminum lid.  I use this pot all the time.  There are a million recipes on youtube to experiment with ."
5.0 out of 5 stars,I converted my mother to the Instant Pot cult this Christmas by buying her this model. She loves it. It's convenient and it's not like the scary pressure cookers she had when we were growing up in the 70s and 80s. The size is perfect for her since she lives alone.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Happy to have this 3 qt Instant Pot Duo Mini. It does so many things and is certainly large enough for a family of 3-4 people. I have found it easy to use. Love the steam release ability when using the pressure cooker. I do, however, wish it came with a more comprehensive cookbook."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"Very functional except for cooking brown rice. If you cook white rice there is a clever program that actually measures the heat and shuts the cooking down when the liquid runs out -- the same as Aroma rice cookers. Unfortunately if you want to cook brown rice you lose the ""smart"" feature and just set the cooking time. The pot will not adjust for slight differences in pouring in the correct amount of rice or liquid, or different absorption levels for different levels of rice.This is a shame for me, because being able to cook brown rice in 17 minutes would be a big plus. Shouldn't effect folks who don't do brown rice."
5.0 out of 5 stars,I am obsessed with my Instant Pot. I was worried about the complexity of the product and thought I might have trouble figuring it out. I WAS WRONG! I haven't had a single issue with it thus far. I haven't yet tried all of the functions but so far so good!THINGS I HAVE TRIED:1. Chicken Breasts2. Chicken Wings3. Rice and Beans4. Soup5. Ribs6. Beef TipsADVICE:1. Read the instruction manual - it is useful information and it's easily understandable.2. There is a table with in the recipe book with suggested cook times for different types of food. SO HELPFUL!3. I got the largest size pot and it was worth the extra money. I can fit so much food in there and its great for food prep!
4.0 out of 5 stars,"I got this pot on prime day. I am a fan of this pot. I used instant pot for three years. My old instant pot is starting to go wrong. So I bought this pot on sale. I have to say it was a great deal. But I like my previous 6 in 1 more. The inner liner of this new pot has only one scale. Without a precise scale, it would be inconvenience for me to cook soup. That is way I did give it 5 star."
5.0 out of 5 stars,Omg.  This was seriously the best investment I’ve ever made!  Cooks food with greatness and convenience.  I love my instant pot and wouldn’t trade it for the world!  I make all sorts of soups and can tenderize meats in an hour!  Simply the best if you make lots of broths and soups!  I’m Asian and we eat lots of soups and porridge!  I’ve yet to make pho broth in it cause I hear it’s super quick to make instead of 6-8 hours of cooking pho broth it takes 1-2 hours in this pot!  Can not wait to try.  8 quart is perfect for my family!
3.0 out of 5 stars,"It's not non stick!The design could be better.The lid should have a marker for easy closing like the camera's lens.Again the steam outlet's design is terrible, got no idea how it works at all."
5.0 out of 5 stars,I loved my first one so much so I bought a second. Makes cooking dinner a snap.
1.0 out of 5 stars,Totally STOPPED WORKING after 3 Mo!!!!!! Use1-2 times a week ONLY too! NEVER AGAIN!
2.0 out of 5 stars,I’ve had this for 3 years and it worked great! I loved it but recently it has stopped working. The I tried to make a recipe I have used before and it did not cook at all. I typically use this to make rice and the seal is for some reason not tight enough anymore despite my attempts to fix it and rice was not cooked. For the amount of money we paid for this it should last more than 3 years. I’m in the market for a new brand because this appliance has done me well until now!!!
5.0 out of 5 stars,This is simply the best purchase I've made in years. Love cooking inside without all the heat. Makes great corn on the cob too.Edited: 8/21/14: Disaster I was not paying attention and had another pot on a burner near my Instapot and melted the control panel. Totally my fault. I expected I'd have to buy a new pot but the good people at InstaPot said they would replace the base unit including shipping from Canada for half the price of what I paid for the device on Amazon. Thank You Michael at InstaPot. This give me an even better feeling about the product! Add great customer service to reasons to buy this.The more I use it the better I like it.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I m a big fan of Instant Pot, i already own a 8 quat and it was too big for everyday usage for me for a family of 4, so the 4 quart is just the perfect for my family and my cooking has never been so easier.More than the cooking, cleaning and  ease with which the delay timer to cook can be used makes it easier to cook everyday and give the family fresh food every single day after a tiring day at work.Love the product."
2.0 out of 5 stars,This is actually a replacement.  Forgot the old one behind when moving.  As a single guy i thought I'd use it more.  Soooo in 18 months and 12 meals (of which i threw 4 meals away cause i didnt trust them) I think I'd still stick with the conventional oven & grill.  Don't really do a whole lot of frozen meat. Soooo. I think I'll put it up on craigslist. What a great waste of $.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Awesome.Really blown away about how easy our first two recipes have been (a veggie crumbles burrito recipe with using the device as a slow cooking device, and a veggie chili where I used it as a pressure cooker). Both turned out outstanding, and it was super easy to setup, cook and clean up. 1 large stainless container and a lid in the dishwasher. And the family really enjoyed the burritos (froze the veggie chili away for the winter, but i liked the bowl I had)."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"We are happy with the purchase of the Instant Pot pressure cooker and have recommended this appliance to our friends and family members. It is well made with stainless steel, is simple and safe to use and cooks really good food. We purchased our Instant Pot pressure cooker as a replacement for a pressure cooker we saw in infomercials on T.V. We returned that cooker, because It was made with too many thin aluminum parts that made contact via high-pressure steam with the food. We do not want to take the chance that aluminum will leech into our food, because aluminum as been linked to various serious illnesses. The Instant Pot has superior construction, produces excellent results, and costs just a little more than the T.V. cooker. You can't go wrong with the Instant Pot."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm single, living alone, and really just wanted something that can be a small crockpot/slow cooker. I'm not sure if I'll ever use it as a pressure cooker, since I don't cook that way. Right now, I'm using it to make largish batches of steal cut oats (2 cups oats, 2 quarts water) that is my normal breakfast. It's FAR easier to make it ahead and just reheat it each morning."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Whats not to love about this great product. Helps with making lots of one pot meals. very easy to use and cooks fast. Only thing is silicon ring on the lid holds smell of foods overtime even though you clean it every time, so I keep 1-2 extra rings for separate kind of food. Like one for gravies and dishes with onion and garlic in it, separate one for sweet or milk/ cream dishes and one for steaming and stuff. Its easy to take out and change the ring once you learn how to do it.Overall a great product and gift item for the ones who love to cook."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This kitchen gadget is so worth it! It’s multi-purpose. It’s a pressured cooker, slow cooker, etc rolled into one. You can also make cheesecakes and cook rice, so you can definitely save space from all those kitchen gadgets and just get one Instant Pot! There’s a lot of recipes available online. Great invention!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I’ve always been a little intimidated by the idea of using a pressure cooker. Felt like with my luck,  it might explode :-) this was so easy to use and my  pot roast recipe (which usually takes 6 to 8 hours stove top)  took two hours and came out every bit as good. I absolutely love this new kitchen appliance. Bye-bye crockpot :-)"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased my Instant Pot several months ago at the suggestion of a friend. I saw how easily they were preparing meals and after a lot of skepticism, I bit the bullet and decided to purchase this unit. I am often very busy between working my full time job which can sometimes run late and my other activities. I wanted something that would be friendly to my vegan lifestyle, since I cook so many staple items (rice, beans, lentils, oats, potatoes). I was looking for something that would allow me to complete tasks in the evenings while still being able to get in a great meal with leftovers for lunch. I also wanted it to be quick. A slow cooker is nice but not when I'm low on time. In came the Instant Pot. It has literally changed my life! I now make breakfast for the week and dinner every couple of days as needed. It does beans so easily that I can prepare large batches of beans to freeze and use for other recipes. Lentils are cooked perfectly in 15 minutes! Brown rice cooks in half the time and is significantly better in the Instant Pot versus a rice cooker."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I absolutely LOVE my Instant Pot.  Yes, It looks overwhelming at first.  Yes, you do have to read the manual.  Hint: Its best to do the ""Initial Test Run with water, this gets you acquainted to your pot and it's timing.  Once you are ready to cook, follow directions for what you are cooking.  Once you cook with this pot a few times, you will love it.  I did have to have my manual out for reference the first few times, but it was easy to follow.  I would purchase the Instant Pot over just a single pressure cooker.  The BIG difference is that the Instant Pot is a RICE COOKER, SLOW COOKER, SAUTEE, PRESSURE COOKER, and more.  So you will get more for your money."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I was scared to try pressure cooking, but intrigued by the idea of getting dinner on the table quickly. The instant pot is every bit as easy to use as it is represented to be. The first time you open that pressure release valve, you may jump a foot or two, but once you know what to expect, there's nothing to it. Whole chicken in under an hour! Love it. And it stays moist, not dried out like it can in the slow cooker. And bone broth that actually gels in just 2 hours! I'm so happy I decided to grab one of these."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Boy is this fun!  I bought the 6 quart originally, but decided it was too big for two people.  The 3 quart is perfect!  Have been having a blast making new and fun things.  Easy to use, easy to clean, makes wonderful meals.  I've been working on converting lots of my tried and true recipes and so far, everything has done beautifully!  What a saving of time.  Put the ingredients in, turn it on, walk away...my kind of cooker."
5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazing product for me as I don’t enjoying cooking!
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my favorite kitchen appliance BY FAR! There are so many features. The only ones I really use thus far are: saute, slow cook, and pressure cook. I like cooking rice on the stove and it only takes 20 minutes anyway. This thing is a beast at sauteing and pressure cooking. I love that I can saute right in the pot, put the lid on, and pressure cook it to completion and I've only used one pot in the process. As well, there are so many sites and blogs and even books dedicated to instant pot recipes and before long you get the hang of working it. 10/10 would recommend."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Especially great for making smaller batches of beans, quickly and with easy clean-up.  Not time consuming since there's no pot to watch over for an hour or two like it would be if I was making beans on the stove top.  I presoak beans over night, and cook them in the morning.  They're done before i know it.  Beans are very healthy to add to your diet and this makes it very easy to do that.  (Canned beans are not a good solution as they're expensive and full of sodium.)"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Ive been using electric pressure cookers for some time.  I have two non stick Cooks Essential pots from qvc, one a 5 and a half quart and the other an 8 quart.  Love them both but I wanted a stainless steel cooking interior; I researched the Instant Pot and with the excellent reviews decided to purchase it.  I love the ease of use and controls.  Simpler to program than my other two.  Would recommend to anyone.Ps.  Ive always hand washed the rubber gaskets after each use, dried them and rubbed a little mineral oil on them.  I feel this will elongate the life of the rubber seal.  Also, on all cooker lids, make sure the gasket is seated into the lid securely as this will make for a good seal and perfect meals!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love this product. It's simple to use and easy to clean. I was a little intimidated to use it at first so it sat in the box for a week or two. After opening the box and following the ""testing"" directions I was good to go! I've made delicious and nutritious meals in little time. So glad to purchase this item. It has made a difference already in my journey to healthier eating! Be sure to buy the cookbook written by Jennifer Robin's "" Paleo Cooking with your Instant Pot"" this takes all the fear away!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,I owned the Cusinart electric pressure cooker but it it just isn't made this well. I'm very impressed with the quality of this brand and I'm happy to have the lager size. This is also a very quiet cooker; I wasn't sure that it was working because it is so quiet.  We have some family staying with us for a few months and having the ability to cook larger amounts for multiple meals is a real plus.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"AWESOME product! One of those ""how did I live without this?"" products. Anything you can create in a pot, takes 20 minutes. The perfect kitchen appliance for busy families that do not have a lot of time to prepare meals and/or don't want to leave the crock pot on all day while they are at work. You need to experiment with cook times when you start out to get meats and vegetables how you want them, but once you do that, you are ready to cook!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Best part of coming home is warm fresh food! Food isn’t burned or anything at the bottom like a regular electric rice cooker and I can make just about everything using the instant pot! Safety is amazing and I would highly recommend this for working families with time constraints, busy family meals, college students and anyone who just wants to make life in the kitchen easier!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"The lid is a little taller than the regular lid. That is my only complaint. It air fries just fine. I most use it to reheat fried foods, such as chicken, fish or french fries. It comes out much better than using a microwave."
5.0 out of 5 stars,I felt comfortable with this pressure cooker.  Very good method to cook quickly and with great results.  Use frequently for hard boiled eggs.
3.0 out of 5 stars,"I actually loved it - for the 2 weeks that it worked.  Now it does not work - trying to get support has been challenging.  You call Instant Pot.  Spend 30 min on the phone explaining what you did and did not do.  They give you a bunch of stuff to try - you spend 3 hours doing that.  Then you have to email them.  A day or two later - you get an email asking you to try all the same stuff over and over again.  I should have just returned it.  I did like it when it worked, but I have no idea when or if it will get fixed."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"I used it to stew some soup, so far so good, saving time, soup tasted just like stewed with pot. The most of the food I cook is rice, this function  is as good as some other rice cooker, but the most important is there are lot of interesting recipes on YouTube you can explore. I will give 4 stars for the design, quality and price."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is, without a doubt, the best kitchen appliance I have bought in years.  I have had it several months now, and have used at least three times per week.  Easy to use, quick clean up and hot nutritious meals in under an hour, start to finish - what more could you want?The recipe book included is limited in scope, but has good timetables that apply to most recipes, and since there are so many books and recipes available on the web and at the library, it really isn't an issue for me.  The thing that delights me most is the ease in which I was able to convert many of my favourite recipes."
2.0 out of 5 stars,The inner pot bottom is badly warped..  This causes a hot area spot on the bottom which creates  a  area that burns the food and makes clean up very difficult..  The warp is very pronounced and should never passed inspection...
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Read reviews about this online through a consumer site that reviews gadgets and gear (but cannot be named on this site despite the fact it doesn't sell anything) and decided to give it a try. I've always been afraid of pressure cookers, imagining some Lucy-Ethel moment of scraping my dinner off the ceiling. It was offered at a great price during the recent holidays. So I tried this one and not only was it easy but dinner was delicious. I highly recommend this applicance. In fact, it's not only great to own, but well worth considering as a wedding or first home gift."
5.0 out of 5 stars,I don't have much time for cooking but I made a pot roast and it was delicious. I believe it is going to be a great time saver for me since I can cook for most of the week all at one time. Will add more later when I have had it longer. My initial feeling is that it is great.
4.0 out of 5 stars,"The instructions included with the unit were confusing, vague and hard to follow.  Quick start references did not provide what the numbers meant or how to use the unit."
3.0 out of 5 stars,I've had this instapot for over 2 years now. The instapot worked great for only the first year. Made tons of great recipes when one day the lid  popped while under pressure and made a complete mess. I cleaned the lid and made sure the gasket was in place and tried again but the instapot has not been able hold pressure since. I've only been able to use it a rice cooker (with the vent open) since that day.
5.0 out of 5 stars,We LOVE our 8 quart instant pot! We have made several soups already and they all came out tasting great. We also purchased the 7 inch Spring Form Pan and made lasagna which came out great. We even made hard boiled eggs so easily and are then so easy to peel. There are so many recipes available on the internet for this pressure cooker that we can't wait to try!!!
5.0 out of 5 stars,"My wife bought a steamer pot at Costco. She used it a couple of times and it worked alright but was really hard to get the lid rotated into place. After she had me help get it on (with difficulty) I told her I had heard that the ""Instant Pot"" had gotten a really good reputation for quality. The pot we had replaced was also difficult with the lid installation. So she returned it and I ordered the Instant Pot. We have used it several times and the lid rotates into place easily. The pot is much heavier than the others we have owned and is really well made and of stout construction. Worked very well and the digital settings and prompts are easy to navigate. The cooking suggestions that accompany it put too much emphasis on steaming as to the right amount of liquids so after going that route the first time cooking ox tail just went back to our usual slow cook with much less liquids and the ox tail came out superb. It cost 30% more than the one we returned but it is nice to have a quality appliance that is an important part of out cooking habits. Comes with an accessory for poaching eggs which is a cool concept although we probably will never use it. We just scramble or fry the rascals."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I use this every day.  I make a big pot of meat and veggies.  I can brown the meat and onions then add the rest of veggies, put the cover on top and cook for a few more minutes until everything is perfectly cooked.  I don't have to add water at all.Much less mess in my kitchen (no spattering).  The insert cleans up easily.  Doesn't heat up the house.  Uses less electricity than a burner.I've also made cheese cake (wonderful) and bone broth in just a few hours instead of a few days."
1.0 out of 5 stars,"Received the Instant pot today. Was excited to get it. Brought it inside, box was taped up. Didn’t look like a new package. Sure enough after I opened it, it was clear that this was returned after someone else used it.Water spots on all of the pieces, paperwork torn, Instruction book dirty I thought I was purchasing a NEW item, not garage sale merchandise for a new price! So disappointed in  Amazon for selling this sort of merchandise.Better off to go to the big box store so you can see what you are buying!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love the versatility f this Instant Pot and it is very user friendly. I love cooking my hard boiled eggs and it is so nice to prepare a last minute supper. I did find the cooking pot a little hard to get clean with soap water and a rag. it seems to be clean until it dries and there is leftover residue. Also the rim where the lid goes on has ridges that are a little hard to get under to clean. Really though, it is a small price to pay for this amazing product!!!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought one of these last xmas, and I really like it so I decided to get me another. No, there nothing wrong with the first one, I still have it. Now with two, I can have meat and potatoes in one and veggies in the other."
5.0 out of 5 stars,This is better than expected quality.  The stainless pot is very good quality and is easy to clean.  The unit I got was defective and the company replaced it with no hassle.  Customer service was very cooperative and quick.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is honestly one of the best investments that I've made in my life.  This thing cooks a roast that would normally take me 8 hours to cook, into a 1.5 hour roast.  I throw basically everything I eat in this thing and it is cooked in a fraction of the time.  If I want to cook some food and fall asleep, I throw it in the Instapot and sleep like a baby knowing that even after my food is done cooking, it will stay warm due to a heater setting turning on after it's done.The one caveat that I have had, is that if you don't make sure the rubber ring on the inside liner is put on correctly, the pot won't seal.My friends have probably gotten sick of me talking about this thing for the last 1.5 years, but the ones that have listened to me and purchased one have loved it!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"My wife suggested that we purchase this since she at seen it in one of her friends kitchen. I was skeptical at first as the slow cooker we had purchased a year ago was now gathering dust. After one month of use I have changed my opinion. It is a remarkably well designed product, although I wish the metal used for the outer body was thicker. We received a dented cooker but it was promptly replaced by Amazon. At first I reckoned it was simply a slow cooker with a timer. But after having cooked several delicious meals, it has completely replaced the 'analog' pressure cooker that we were using on our stove. No longer do we need to count the whistles and stick around to turn off the stove. The digital controls make it easy to have precise control and reproduce the same cooking conditions every time. The auto-on timer is a boon for working families. And the auto stop/keep warm function makes you free to attend to other chores around the house. We have even used it to make yogurt and batter for crepes. The steel inner pot is easy to clean. Cleaning the lid takes some careful handling, nothing too bad. The inner frame of the cooker is super strong and seems like it could hold the high pressure easily. The functions are easy to get used to without the need to reference the manual. Both high and low pressure cooking is possible. Several recipe books are available on kindle (free and paid) and many groups on Facebook that you can join to swap recipes. Overall we are delighted with this product."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm a complete novice, so I still need use the majority of the functions on this IP.  So far, I've used this for soups, stews, sautes, and have made things in it like ribs, wings and stir fry.  It cooks very fast and clean up is so simple.  Safety is a big thing for me because I am a complete ditz, and you can allow this thing to vent for several minutes before it ALLOWS you to safely open the top, as you cannot remove the lid until it sense that it's safe to do so.  LOVE IT!!  I can't hurt myself!  :)))If it's this wonderful with pressured cooked meals, the rice has to be excellent, too!  Can't wait!! :))) .  This is my new toy in the kitchen. :D"
5.0 out of 5 stars,I am not a planner when it comes to meals. It is so great to be able to take out frozen meat and have a meal in less than an hour (time varies depending on what you are cooking). For lunch today and tomorrow I put 2 frozen salmon fillets and set the pressure cooker to 1 minute. It took about 5 minutes to pressurize and 1 minute to cook and did a quick release of pressure (in about the time it took to cook broccoli in the microwave) my salmon was done and perfect! I could have steamed the broccoli in it also but I have not invested it a steamer basket yet. My InstantPot gets used a minimum of 4 times a week! Best purchase ever!
4.0 out of 5 stars,"It makes delicious fried foods! However, I have 2 complaints: 1. the basket is too small and 2. the circular metal piece that is supposed to make two layers in the basket does not stay put! We'll just probably use it for fries. Too small to cook a meal for a family of 4."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"After trying the Cuisinart, the Power Pressure Cooker XL and now the Instant Pot we finally found the right fit for us! We were impressed especially with the stainless steel pot. We were worried about the non stick pots on the other 2 units not lasting as long. The instant pot also has more options and settings that come in handy. We felt it heated up just a bit faster that the others. Overall we are very impressed with the Instant Pot. I would recommend to anyone looking for the best Electric Pressure Cooker"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Works as advertised. Used about 8 times so far - several soups, potatoes.  Better than microwave potatoes. You'll find better directions online through Google or YouTube though. Seal in lid can retain odor of spices - working on ways to clean."
1.0 out of 5 stars,"I own 6 qt instantpot but for easier handling I Bought this Instant pot in Nov 2018 and started getting C6 error from April 2019 onwards. When we contacted instant pot customer service, they told us dry the base and try again and this did not fix it for us and they have not replaced the item either. Very disappointed!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"One of the best appliances I have purchased in a long time. Mainly used for cooking rice, which has significantly decreased cooking time especially for 10cups! Have also used for veggies and racks of ribs! Easy to use and easy to clean and store. Highly recommend, completely satisfied with the purchase!!"
1.0 out of 5 stars,All dented horrible shape used. Parts missing. Hugs d not pay a dollar for it from Gidwill!!!
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Folks, consider this a public service announcement. This is Harry Potter - er, INSTANT POT (aka my magical new best friend). This is not your granny's scary old pressure cooker!👵 It's a workhorse! 🐎 Steel-cut oats are ready in 10 mins. 🍲 A whole chicken? 🐓 25 mins. The perfect boiled egg is done in 6 minutes and is so easy to peel that The Donald could do it.🙊 In a stew about how little time you have to get dinner on the table? Beef it on up in 40 mins! 🐄 No time to defrost that frozen meat? No problemo - the IP can handle it. It sports functions for soup, meat, beans, rice, poultry - even yogurt - all with the press of a button and then keeps your food warm for hours. This fella even makes the perfect cheesecake! Say WHAT?!? gasp emoticon Now you can donate your crock pot, because this guy does that kind of job, too - in fact, it does everything but grocery runs. There's even a FB community for sharing tips and recipes.👥 It's a lot of bling for the 💰, and Amazon will be happy to sell you one. Your oven will be happy with the long break from cooking.😊"
5.0 out of 5 stars,I threw out my rice cooker and crock pot and gained spaceI have even canned successfully (applesauce and other fruit based) but keeping in mind extra time needed for processing.  I even hard boiled eggs! Easy peel! (Again I had to correct process time for my altitude). Thinking about getting one for thé RV.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have used a slow cooker for years and this hands down will save you time. I've made pulled pork, rice (several ways) & barbacoa so far. It cuts your cook time from 12 hours to an hour. The meat comes super juicy and full of flavor...especially the barbacoa. I look forward to using all the recipes except the porridge"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Better than I thought it would be.  I tried a much cheaper pressure cooker  before and I have  decided  it's not  worth the effort.  A month ago  I ran into  this  one, so I bought it and I'm  glad I did.  First  it keeps  my  kitchen  clean, and cook  the  food  really  fast and keep all the  flavor in. It cook the best  rice ever in a 10 minutes  it's  ready. So far there is nothing  I couldn't  cook in this lovely electric  computerized  pot.  I'm  very  good  at the kitchen,  I'm  kinda know  what I'm doing,  since I got this pot,  made  it  much faster, easier and less Messy.  Definitely  I recommend  this product."
5.0 out of 5 stars,Cook a roast or meatloaf less than half the time. Excellent for cornbread with the Non Stick insert pan. Also buy the steamer basket for eggs and veggies.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have made 3 whole chickens, pulled pork, countless hard boiled eggs, chili, jambalaya, frozen chicken breasts, mac & cheese twice and egg cups.I have not been disappointed or disappointed with the meal served.  This thing is a serious time saver for an active family of 4!!!!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Anyone who is into HEALTHY eating should own this Instant Pot. You can make your pot of rice or grain for the week, make beans from scratch that have NO SODIUM and make a multitude of soups, greens, yogurt, veggie dishes etc. We don't eat meat so this makes cooking a little faster. I LOVE that it has a stainless steel insert pot VERSUS a teflon one that my old one used to have. The instruction booklet that comes with the pot is a little confusing but, luckily I already knew how to us a PC. I have even bought it as a gift for people since I love it so much. If you're thinking about getting one, this is the one. Put it in your cart and BUY IT today:)"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"U can cook almost everything in it, so easy to use, my husband can cook with it!I almost never use the stove anymore, to cook more than 1 dish or pot i have pot more than 1 pot and lid, u can cook a dish remove the pot and start another, u can always reheat the pots on the stove as wellOnly 1 thing i dont like, make a bigger pot plz!"
1.0 out of 5 stars,"Started having problem with my isntant pot a month after I started using it.  Steam would release from the handle release before it would switch to my desired cook setting.  I opened a ticket with Instant Pot on 2/22/17 and have not heard back from the company.  I tried using it again today and got a C6 error message,  basically indicating my pot is dead.  I loved my Instant Pot while it lasted.  Hopefully customer service will respond soon."
3.0 out of 5 stars,"Initial instructions had so many cautionary statements that I was concerned about turning a valve the wrong way and releasing too much pressure or steam.  The cookbook was very limited and had mostly very large meal ideas.  It just sat there for 2 weeks so I had to return it.  I may buy again, but I feel as though I would need to alot time to find recipes and be try the various settings."
3.0 out of 5 stars,It just doesn't seem that convenient to me.  Maybe I need to use it more and get use to it but my air fryer seems easier to use and more convenient for the things I make.  I don't really see what hoopla was about this cooker.
1.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought this pot on 1/23.  It is now 2/25 & I’ve been trying to cook stew & seal the lid for an entire hour!  I’ve rewashed the lid, removed the ring, soaked it properly, dried it off, and replaced the lid at least 5 times.  I finally “forced” the lid to seal by giving the lid a quick downward push, creating a vacuum that popped the pressure pin up.  Now, to attempt to finish what should have been a 45 minute stew, I have to cook with a book sitting on top of the handle to keep pressure on the lid.  I’ve been having sealing issues since the 3rd time I used this pot, & have tried to be patient while troubleshooting possible issues.  My patience has finally left me.  Unfortunately, I’m unable to return this $120 pot. I’m afraid to spend $ on a different model, in fear I’ll have the same issues."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"If you buy this for no other reason but to make rice and hard boiled eggs, it's completely worth the money.  I've tried adding vinegar, baking soda and other things to make the peels come off with mixed outcomes.  I've made hard boiled eggs in this 5 times now and they've come out perfect every time.  The eggs just fall out of the shell.I've only had this for a couple weeks now and I haven't used this to it's full potential.  It's probably unnecessary to buy something that is 100+ dollars just to do hard boiled eggs, but if you're sick of peeling eggs for hours get this thing.  It works."
3.0 out of 5 stars,"The fryer itself has been incredible - I use it more than 5 times per week and have cooked a large number of different items in the past 4 months.  The 3 stars is because the non-stick coating on the air fryer basket accessory is chipping/flaking off even with minimal use and no ill-treatment (I.e., hand wash only, no metal utensils).  I use papers as a liner now, but will probably just toss the basket and use something else as I don’t like the possibility of getting chunks of the coating coming off in our food"
4.0 out of 5 stars,"This does take a bit of getting used to. They do have great customer service that answers the telephone when you don't understand something. Love that! Does it cook foods better than regular pots or dutch type ovens, probably not as you still have to prepare everything. The downside is that you cannot doctor up the food while it is in the cooking stage. It's a set it and forget it and hope it comes out right."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Even if I only used this to make rice, it would've been a worthwhile investment (perfect rice every time)! I regularly cook beans, which takes 6+ hours in the slow cooker, but in the instant pot it takes less than an hour! Amazing! This thing makes perfect boiled eggs and they peel effortlessly. I've gotten my 5-year-old eating hard boiled eggs every day (and she is such a picky eater, so I'm thrilled)! It does so much more, just get one!"
4.0 out of 5 stars,The one thing I wish I did more research was browning of meat. This one doesn’t. But it sure does the job for everything lease you put in it!
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased the 6 quart.  It will hold 12 eggs with one cup of water.  After it reaches full pressure, set the cook time for five minutes.  When time is up use the quick release valve. When pressure is completely released open lid and put the eggs in ice water.  I did 5 dozen eggs and the shells came off cleanly and easily.  I have purchased a receipe book so I can try other amazing ways to use it."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"My son works a lot of long hours for Boeing.  It is often 7:00 p.m. or later.  Now he is able to put dinner on while he showers.  It is ready or nearly so when he is finished.  He says he really enjoys it.  However, I bought him the 8 quart and since he is alone I think he would have enjoyed the 6 quart.  But the 8 quart is great for company.  You can enjoy them while dinner is cooking."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love, love, love this little pressure cooker. I primarily bought it for making yogurt, but have used it for other food items. It is well constructed and perfect for cooking smaller meals. Easy to clean and I love that the inner pot is made of stainless steel. I can't wait to try more dishes."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Large, 8 qt pot.. well made.. Like my old pressure cooker, but more versatile with Tons of help online from other users.. Totally worth the price! Great price on sale.. Frozen 8 lb chicken.. to roast chicken dinner in under an hour and a half.."
3.0 out of 5 stars,"It's OK as an appliance.  I'm not a tekkie and this little appliance is a bit complicated for me.  We made a whole chicken with vegetables in it one evening for dinner.  It's speedy, but the taste was a bit boring despite the spices and veggies we added.  The next night we roasted a chicken on our stainless steel vertical roaster, all golden brown and juicy with no need for spices.  What a huge flavor difference. I will keep the Instant Pot on the off chance that I need a relatively safe pressure cooker.  I doubt seriously i will take the time to sauté in it or try to use any of the other functions.  It actually seems like it makes simple and delicious cooking tasks like sautéing and roasting ridiculously complicated.Contrast this appliance with the fact that we bought a Nespresso Pixie for ourselves for Christmas.  Simple to use with fabulous results.  Just the combination we prefer."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased this IP primarily for pressure cooking! I now find that I use it daily.Finally, making soup stock from chicken or beef bones is quick & easy. Also, I can cook a 5 lb chicken in 40-50 minutes.On a health note, pressure cooking disables most of the harmful “lectins” in our food.Love it!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,I'm head over hills in love with this instant pot. I use it at least 3 times a week. It is perfect for a busy family who doesn't have a lot of time to get a meal together. The features are easy to use. It comes with a recipe book. There are plenty of good Pinterest recipes online and facebook groups. The only thing that is a tiny bit frustrating is the seal holds the smells of previous meals. I recommend buying extra seals and designating them by color for particular types of meals.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I debated back and forth on whether to get the 6 quart or 8 quart, but decided it’s better to go larger.  The 8 quart is a good size.  Most recipes are written for the 6 quart, but you just need to make sure you have enough liquid for the 8 quart and you are good to go.  It’s easy and everything I’ve made has been great.  The insert pot is not the easiest to clean.  I usually end up soaking it for awhile before attempting to clean it."
5.0 out of 5 stars,I am so glad that I decided to try this out.  I am able to make dinner for my family of 5 from frozen to table in 2 hours or less.  This has already earned its cost back by saving our eating out bills.  I often forget to take food out and then end up going out for dinner because nothing is thawed.  This is no longer a problem for us because frozen meat is no match for this machine.  I recommend that you order the accessories set and a cookbook too.  Then your cooking options will be limitless! If you are one the fence I recommend you jump right off and get this one.  It's a keeper!!!
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This pot is so versatile and can do some much. I've used it as a slow cooker, pressure cooker and rice cooker. It was convenient for all purposes. The manual didn't quite explain that the pressure valve can be pulled out in the locked position until the pressure rises which took some investigating but otherwise it's easy to understand and use. I've used it to make oatmeal, stews, beans and steaming vegetables.In the summer I place it outside so I don't have to worry about creating heat in the house which is a lifesaver. I also love that it's easy to clean!"
4.0 out of 5 stars,"Just made chicken chili on slow cooker and the rice didn't so cooked further on low pressure and it came out delicious.Very pleased so far just a little nervous about high pressure cooking.  My mother once had a pressure cooker explode.  She was cooking beets at a neighbor's, she said the mess was incredible, beets and beet juice all over the ceiling and the entire kitchen."
5.0 out of 5 stars,Perfect size for one or two people. At higher altitudes it takes longer than the directions say. It infuses flavor into every single bite.  I do not even have to remember to take meat out of the freezer for dinner. Easily cooks frozen meat
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought two attachments for my Kitchenaid mixer. The slicer, shredder and the meat grinder. Both have saved me work in preparing food. I also bought the Kitchenaid food prossecer and it is so powerful and quieter than a whisper. I'm a happy camper. Thanks."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Absolutely love this pot!  Used stove top pressure cookers for years but this is great.  Does not heat up your kitchen, you can walk away and leave it and not worry about it.  So versatile to have a store cooker, steamer, rice cooker etc., all in one.  Would recommend in a heartbeat.  Bought my MIL one for Christmas :-)  Now (February 2017) out of five people in the small office I work in, 4 of us have Instant Pots!  We love it.  I have made so many awesome meals already and I only got it in November!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"The Instapot has made meal preparation so much easier and quicker. I am enjoying trying new recipes because the Instapot has made it so much more fun, too! So far I have used the saute and pressure cooker features and they have worked so well. It is also encouraging me to prepare meals ahead for the week and to eat healthier. Overall, I feel it was a wise purchase."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Works great. Extremely versatile.The included paper manual says that it comes with two seals, but it only came with one. This is too bad because you need to disassemble and wash the seal as part of cleaning (it would be nice to swap, so may buy an extra seal)."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"For a while, it was being used for almost everything I cooked. Now that I’ve had it for about a year, I’ve definitely scaled back the usage of it. However, I would say I’m still very happy with it for some dishes I cook, and it’s great as a rice cooker as well."
5.0 out of 5 stars,This is in the top 3 kitchen appliances I own. I will never go without one again. The meals that come out of this are delicious. We can have a pot roast in less than an hour. That includes time to peel and cut the potatoes and carrots. I also use it as a slow cooker and rice cooker. Two small appliance that I used to own. They went to the thrift store after buying this. We also can our own vegetables from the garden. I can't wait to try that function out this summer.
1.0 out of 5 stars,The product arrived in original box. The box was damaged all over. May have been delivered an instant pot that was returned previously and not brand new. Missing one of the accessories that came with it (extra seal ring).
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have been thinking about getting one of these for a while now.  We ended up with extra money at Christmas time and decided to get one.  I am glad I did.  I have been using it two or three times since we got it.  There is a huge number of places to find delicious recipes on the internet which makes it even more fun to have.  We have made roasts, casseroles and Asian dishes all with great results."

5.0 out of 5 stars,"I cooked some ribs for 30 minutes and then put BBQ sauce on and broiled for 15 minutes in the oven. Let's just say it's very tender, more than fork tender, more like I chewed through some rib bones tender. I literally eat some bone where it's powdered like potato. Delicious!I have a sous vide machine on the counter, two grills on the backyard deck, and a cooking torch in the cabinet, so I have learned a thing or two about cooking meat. In one Instant meal, this Pot has earned its keep in my repertoire. Amazing!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,I like it but when I bought it I didn’t see it stating it was a mini or I didn’t realize it was a mini! be careful how much stuff you put in or else when you release the pressure all the meats fluids will be released too spraying everywhere like I did
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Could NOT believe how incredibly better this was compared to my last one for five years. It logistically 'doesn't' make sense but it clearly OUTperforms way more than I could properly describe. The heat to cook and cooking time, for one, seems to be considerably less... The front, clear controls are superb. The functional value that it is is a dream for the college kid as much as the bachelor or the common family: IT COOKS FOOD FAST! Easily would repurchase this but I won't!! Why? Because I purchased a full 3 three warranty!! HAHAHAHAHA!!!!!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is called the magical pot in our house.  It does whatever we want (within its functional parameters of course).  It even fixed itself after getting water in the wrong places.  If that happens to you the best thing to do is let it sit and dry for 3 or 4 days.  Don't let it sit in water ever, but if you are cleaning it and it gets too wet around the circuits follow the 3-4 day dry rule and see how it does.We have had this for over a year now with repeated use throughout each week over that period of time.  It works and it works well.  It truly is the magic pot (no references to other substances intended here)."
5.0 out of 5 stars,I made chicken soup and mashed potatoes. Both came out fantastic. This is the first time I’ve used a pressure cooker. It didn’t take too long to figure out. I did call the help line for clarification just to be sure. The only problem is the chicken soup was not clear as there is no way to skim it during cooking.
3.0 out of 5 stars,"...it's slightly too small for me. Most recipes call for a 6-quart pot, and to be quite honest, when I'm using this, I'm looking to make food for a meal and then some for later on, and a 3-quart just doesn't cut it.The pot itself? It's great. Very handy.Just too small if you're doing anything other than a lot of prep for a single meal for 2-3 people."
5.0 out of 5 stars,BEST investment ever! We use it several times a week. So nice for working families to fix good meals! Read the directions and follow them to be safe and you will love this! There are recipes all over the internet that work with this! Keep little ones away when in use or put it where they cannot get to it- common sense.
5.0 out of 5 stars,Bought for sister-in-law law. She loves it

Not only can I make my children of the corn a full meal in less than half an hour, but cleanup is a breeze. One pan and done. If you live a busy, active life you need this!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I’ve used a slow cooker for years and loved it, but wanted the additional option of pressure cooking. I bought the Instant Pot and am thrilled with the additional capabilities. It is particularly helpful as I make my own bone broth. 48 hours of slow cooking has been reduced to two. Much easier!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Talk about fantastic!  I received this for my birthday and have literally used it every day since! For an active family of 5, this is a total time saver.  It cooked a 9 pound roast in 2 hours, baked potatoes in 10 minutes.  Also, a whole roasted chicken with veggies in 25 minutes, and then I was able to make chicken stock from said chicken the same night to use the next night for wild rice & mushroom soup!  Coming home from a long day of work and sports makes dinner preparation so easy."
4.0 out of 5 stars,This pot works fantastic! All manner of foods can be prepared in it. Very good quality. Only problem is with this particular pot there was not a Model / Serial number plate or sticker on the item anywhere. Therefore we cannot register the product. Still a great product!
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Hi, I just received my instant pot. However it is not complete. I wonder weather it is original or not.I was disappointed first when I saw it first. because first when I saw the panel the pressure button was not as you see it on the video. besides the spoons and caps are not included. but they are irrelevant I am using what I have at home. just set up every thing u want and turn on you cooker and go to your another job. that is all, you cool warm dinner any time.Guys, this is the best cooker i ever have. great to cook with any hassle to stir or watch you stove. every cook comes out well dome and testy."
5.0 out of 5 stars,This is but far the best product I have purchased in recent years. Highly recommend buying 1. It cooks food super fast but you do not lose any flavoring. I cooked a roast in 55 minutes!!  Never thought that would be possible. Easy to clean.  The metal bowl comes right out and is easy to wash. I thought it was difficult to figure out the steam release at first but once you figure it out it’s easy to use.
5.0 out of 5 stars,This is the third Instant Pot I have purchased.  This one was for my son and daughter-in-law and they love it as much as I do.  Hundreds...maybe thousands...of recipes on the Internet and everything is so simple and delicious.  I am getting the desire to go cook using my Instant Pot just typing this recommendation.  If you haven't tried one...what are you waiting for?  This is a must have for your kitchen along with an air fryer.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Out of the box I made my first meal.... in 8 MINUTES!  It was perfect!  I don't know why I waited so long to get an Instant Pot!  This will become my newest best friend!  Throw out the slow cooker, rice cooker, steamer, etc.  All you need is an Instant Pot!!!  VERY EASY to use!  Read the manual - do the water test and you'll be on your way to enjoying life while your best meals are cooking for you!  :)"
5.0 out of 5 stars,I love my instant pot. I used to use the old pressure cooker and now I don’t want even see one in my house because the instant pot does the job much better! I love making several recipes but my favorite is beans! It cooks the beans perfectly.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Wow I really didn't expect to rave about this. I first used this for Thanksgiving mashed potatoes. Typically takes forever to boil potatoes but the Instant Pot took 10 MINUTES to cook them to perfection. I got the Mini 3 quart version and it's perfect for my tiny kitchen and my single tiny stomach.Read instructions carefully. I added too much water the first time and when the pressure let loose, it turned into Ol Faithful."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This has turned out even better than I thought it would. Plus there are lots of cookbooks and Facebook pages dedicated to Instant Pots! Who knew!! I do recommend that if you are following a recipe, make sure it is for the mini pot. If it is for one of the larger ones and adjust accordingly. There are so many functions; I haven't even used them all yet."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"First modern pressure cooker I used and I like it. It has 9 presets for cooking but you can manually set time and the pressure level.  You can slowcook & steam but haven't tried these yet. I'd like the pot to come with more accessories: silicone ring picks up odors so spares are needed, non stick pot should be standard, glass top for slow cooking, some addons for steaming. You can easily spend as much on this as the pot itself. I use heatproof gloves to take the pot out while hot but feel like there could have been some safer way to design this. I can't testify to durability at this point but it seems well built. All together, gets thumbs up from me."
3.0 out of 5 stars,"It's pretty good. I don't know a whole lot about Instant Pot cooking, but I've tried a few things and it's easy to use. The only problem I'm having is that my stuff isn't getting cooked through sometimes. Probably a user issue though. Also most recipes are written for 6qt so I really wish I got that one...."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"Versatile and handy. For the small size, it is a bit over priced in comparison to the larger one. But if it has to be small, it has to be small..."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I really like the instant pot, it's been great in terms of lowering the effort required to cook.Things to know: The stainless steel pot actually stains due to the cooking method, it's normal and apparently happens to everyone. Also, recipe times generally don't include the time it takes to pressurize - it can be anywhere between 5 to 15 minutes to pressurize and only after that happens (when the float valve goes up) will the countdown timer start.I do like the product a lot though, and it's been very good so far!"
1.0 out of 5 stars,"I received a defective product and it's certainly not ""instant"" pot. I'm trying to return it but i am stuck due to this Covid crisis. I don't know how can I return this product before 27th April, the date mentioned by the Amazon, if shelter in place order is till April 30. They should consider the difficult scenario and atleast extend the return date or give me me my money back. I will trash this defective product."
5.0 out of 5 stars,I love this Instant pot because it saves you lost of time and money. I need some time to adjust myself for the cooking time because it is my first instant pot and I don't know for how long I should cook the vegetables for example. I cooked the meat and it was tender and yummy. It is made with very good material quality and it will last for a long time. I totally recommend this product.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I was literally in shock at how this does what I was told and it's even better!! I at first bought it thinking ""well maybe it will be as good as the hype"". But it went past my expectations and beyond!!  Never did I think I was going to make yogurt or freaking cheese cake in an instant pot!!!!"
3.0 out of 5 stars,I have used it for the pressure mode and it was great but today I tried the slow cooking mode. I was so disappointed!!! I did a pot roast and checked on it after four hours it was still raw! I ended up finishing cooking in in the pressure mode. I will try it one more time as a slow cooker but won’t count on much
5.0 out of 5 stars,"So far so good!  We just bought our Instant Pot week ago and have cooked a pot roast with carrots and potatoes, and the next night it ham hock & beans, and both came out perfect!  Our normal ham hock & beans recipe called for a slow cooker and about 12 hours of cooking.  We cut that down to 1 hour with the Instant Pot.  Last night I cooked what I called ""fall off the bone baby back ribs"" in 18 minutes!  They were the best ribs I'd ever eaten and so darn good I had to share the recipe so I made my first YouTube food video, I never thought I do something like that!  You can do a YouTube search for SanDiegoJoey Davis or copy this link, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2Cnz2_AyJM"
3.0 out of 5 stars,The unit looks good and solid. I was not aware that I was sold without a Sealing Ring. There is no indication if I need to buy the sealing ring at the same time of purchasing the unite. I read the troubleshooting pages and learnt that a sealing is needed for the unite!
5.0 out of 5 stars,"We love, love our instant pot and use it almost daily. We are a family of 3 and got the 6 quart- we like making a little extra and having the leftovers! There is a slight learning curve, but it is pretty easy to figure out! Great buy and I love that we got it during a holiday weekend on a great sales price!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"One of the most useful appliances in the kitchen. Takes a lot of guesswork out of making rice.  The best part about this appliance is that it saves a lot of time and I do not have to babysit it like I would with a stovetop pressure cooker.  This thing can make almost everything, and there is no shortage of instant pot recipes online.Successfully made:Chili con carne, Masala Chai, baby back ribs, mac and cheese, carnitas, pho, white rice, soft boiled eggs, and many more things."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I used to do braised dishes in the dutch oven on weekends, think like 3 or 4 hours (or more) on the stove for some chile verde or beef stew.  Now I can do it on a weeknight.  You can turn a cheap cut of meat like pork shoulder or beef chuck into something that melts in your mouth in 30 minutes of pressure cooking (plus the 10-15 minutes it takes to heat up)."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I was always afraid of my mother's pressure cooker growing up. When she passed I was in no way taking that thing. When I read Dr. Wahl's books on health...I looked into this pot, which she recommends. I would not parts with it now, for the world. It is a wonderful addition to my kitchen. I use it regularly!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"My crockpot broke so I got this to replace it.  It's great because you can also saute right in the Instant Pot before you set it to slow cook or you can use it as a pressure cooker.  It's a little difficult to get used to using it, but it's easy to adapt recipes online as long as the meat and liquid content are the same.  As a newbie, I was able to pressure cook a whole chicken, make bone broth, and then make chicken noodle soup.  With the added time to get to pressure and release pressure, it's not ""instant"", but it does cook a lot quicker than most things and it is mostly hands off.  If it's finished before you are home or ready to eat, it just keeps it warm."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is an amazing product!  That said, if you've never cooked with a Pressure Cooker, know that there is a learning curve! However there are more groups and websites online than you can shake a stick at!  So, take the plunge and buy one!  My chicken has never been so tender and succulent!My only 'gripe'... it is BIG!! We bought the 8QT for two of us and it's probably too much for only two of us.  I'll probably give this one to my daughter for her family and buy a smaller Instant Pot."
5.0 out of 5 stars,Love it. I've only used it a couple of times and it's worked great it's not too big and bulky and it's on the counter with my other appliances.
2.0 out of 5 stars,"I don't like the way the customer care ask the questions. Even though they sent the a replacement when I initially informed them that the product is not powering on they sent me a replacement even then the one which was sent as replacement is not working.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my favorite appliance that I own. As-a-matter-of-fact, I had a 6 qt model, and I gave it away so I could order a bigger one. I love it, and I use it several times each week.I bought some cookbooks for it, but it is also easy to find recipes and directions online.You will not be sorry!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love it! A perfect size for just the two of us! I got this one for our camper, but it would be just as good a size for us as the bigger one that we keep in our house. The bigger one does take up a lot of space and is heavier."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"What have I been doing with my life?? This is hands down the best kitchen appliance I have ever used. So far I have made ribs, chicken for tacos, tamales, shrimp boil, potatoes, chicken tikka masala, pot roast, and pulled pork. Everything has been perfect. This can also be used as a rice cooker. I havent used it for rice yet simply because I have a new rice cooker that I love. This instant pot makes cooking great meals so quick and easy. I wish I had bought one years ago."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Awesome kitchen gadget!  I’m loving all the cool stuff you can make in this pot. I’m making awesome casseroles and saving them in the food saver bags for a later date. It makes perfect slot boiled eggs. It makes incredibly moist, tender potatoes. Warning... you will buy about a dozen gadgets to go with your pot in order to use it to the fullest. Trivets, an extra pot, wood spoon, flat whisk, gaskets, etc. But don’t let that deter you!  You will fall in love with this pot in just a short time. 😁"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased my Instant Pot on Cyber Monday, but when it arrived, I was in the middle of a bad upper respiratory infection and had to let it sit for a couple of days.  I finally took a half-eaten chicken carcass, threw it in the pot with some chopped onions and covered with water.  In 35 minutes I had a nice chicken broth.  For dinner I made chicken with rice with the stock and leftover meat I had taken off the bones.  Done in 10 minutes with perfectly cooked brown rice. This past week I used it for all the steps of making stew.  It was quick, easy, and tasty.  Yesterday I made yogurt.  I had a little trouble with figuring out how to go from sterilizing the milk to fermenting the milk.  I called customer service and had the answer in 30 seconds.  This morning I had delicious yogurt for breakfast.  This is fast becoming one of my favorite all-time appliances.  I can't wait to see what all it will do."
5.0 out of 5 stars,Another Prime Days stellar buy at 60% off!  Heard girls in my office raving about the Insta Pot and one told me had to get one and they took my phone and made me order one! What a great buy. So versatile and easy to use. A little daunting at first but pretty fool proof with a good recipe. The best split pea soup and black beans ever!! Hail the Insta Pot. Hail Prime Days bargains. Made it worth membership and who doesn’t like a bargain!!! Beats paying full price.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Updated Review!!!After buying my first one in April, I just bought my second one this month.  I have also bought one for my niece and my Auntie(who also grew up with the old fashioned scary ones).  Have never had a moments regret and would recommend them to anyone.  There is also a Facebook group that is extremely helpful to all people who either have one or want to research them!  https://www.facebook.com/groups/InstantPotCommunity/895835930510396/?notif_t=group_comment_followLOVE THIS!  Have used it almost daily since I got it.  Doing ribs, rice, veggies.  All sorts of things.  I bought Slow Food Fast by Bob Warden and have made quite a few of the recipes in that book.  Very good for beginners and my sister got tired of hearing me brag about how easy and quick food was to make and ended up buying hers just a couple of weeks later.  And my nieces are wanting them also."
5.0 out of 5 stars,This is my go to for almost every meal!! It’s so easy to use and crazy fast!! From frozen chicken and uncooked rice to a whole meal in 30 minutes!! It came at the perfect time as I am expecting my first child and I know this will be easy to use as I will be running off of no sleep and have little time to prep meals. I highly recommend everyone get one!!
5.0 out of 5 stars,"The only manual available for this is on their website - you have to download/print.  I have used it once and worked pretty well.  I wish I had more literature for it to see what all I can do, but I'm sure with some research I'll find what I need.  The device itself is great and looks exactly like the pic.  The size is nice - I'm replacing a crock pot that was too small for much of what I want to do.  I have a stovetop pressure cooker I use for canning, so liked the concept of this one.  So far I'm satisfied with the product, just wish they would be more giving with information."
5.0 out of 5 stars,I love it!! It works great and is super easy to use. I preheat it for about a minute or two before I put the food in there and it makes a difference on the crispness of the food. I also put down foil so you don’t even really have to clean anything. I highly recommend this product as it makes for a 2 in 1 product!!
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love it!!! I have been hearing about Instant pot from many people.. well, they are right! I cannot live without it now especially cold winter.  We have been eating at home much more after purchasing this product.  Easy to cook healthier and comfort food in no time"
2.0 out of 5 stars,"It does air dry! However, only the top of the divider works well to actually crisp. It is so small and stacking food takes longer or just doesn't come out right. You can only air fry very little food at a time. It wasn't worth the effort. If it was for a one person snack, then it'd be great. Love the InstaPot though!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Very impressed with this product of how easy it is to use. From the front control panel, the lid valves and cleaning it after the cook. It is most definitely something that cuts cook time down drastically. Which makes it nice for really long cooks or busy days to get the meal done quick. There are so many recipes for it on google, Pinterest and YouTube. I personally own this duo 8qt unit, 6qt, 3qt and the 8qt ultra. I also bought 4) 8qt duo’s and gave them away for Christmas gifts. I really do believe this is a must have for the kitchen and makes cooking easy. I’m not a chef but with this cooker and some ingredients....it will make you feel like you are."
3.0 out of 5 stars,"Although it advertises as a ""one pot meal"" solution to preparing meals- I wasn't impressed with all of the prep work and pre browning some meats as reccomended in the oven prior to completing the meals in the pot. Also, in making perhaps a pot roast - it's necessary to cook several items individually and/or cook in the Instant Pot then wait for the cooling cycle - then add and restart the process. So, in the end after a weeks worth of ""one pot meals"" in the Instant Pot I'd say; not so fabulous. I believe it could be one of the number on selling items; and perhaps for someone who has very few kitchen tools and a very small kitchen, unless your happy with most of your meals being soups and stews and such - then this is just an extra chore and takes up space. As far as ""canning"" goes in this - here again, this is a pressure cooker that will only accomodate about 4 jars - and if you're anything like me - this is practically a useless feature. I'd say my good ole' crock pot may take all day to prepare a meal - but at least I am happier with that. As far as some of the ""family friendly"" featured meals - it may be a better choice for the busy working family with lots of kids who love mac n' cheese. But, it is a good concept and worth a try at least."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I got this as Christmas Gift for my Mom and she LOVES it.  She has been going online and finding all kinds of recipes to follow designed for this product and the results are amazing.  It has been in constant use since then and it works like a champ.  The only thing that is better than having one of these is having two or three of them.  Meat or potato Stew in one, rice in another, and desert in the third all at once.  My mother tells me that what used to take 2-3 hours on the stove now takes 30 minutes.  GREAT product."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I use it at least 3 time a week and I have to say every recipe I’ve created in the Instant Pot has come out amazing.  I’ve made everything from Home Made pastrami to yogurt.  My only criticism:  It lives on my kitchen counter, so I wish it had an On/Off switch so I didn't have to keep plugging it in and unplugging it."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"You can use this for JUST about everything, I also have the lid which allows for air fry etc. You don't need a crock pot plus a fryer, plus, plus, plus!  All you need in this in the kitchen and you'll love the convenience and ease of cooking,."
5.0 out of 5 stars,We purchased this for our Star Wars Duo 60 and wondered if it would fit. It does! I’m so exited to try a bunch of new things.
5.0 out of 5 stars,I purchased our Instant Pot from Amazon's Black Friday deals and I couldn't have been happier to save and receive such a quality product. I've been using it every night so far and love how many uses it has besides a slow cooker. I've found the presets to be very helpful and it's been fun learning all the different ways I can use it. I couldn't recommend this more!
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought this during the black friday sale in 2015.  I was looking for a replacement crock pot and bought this instead.  I use it every day.  It is simple and straight forward to use.  It saves on energy.  I can put dinner in this at lunchtime and have it ready by 5, even with frozen meat.I bought a second stainless steel insert.  That allows me to cook rice in one insert while I keep the dinner warm in the oven inside the other insert.  The inserts don't nest so it is a bit bulky for storage, but I haven't actually put it away in the cupboad because it's always in use.Thanks for a great product, Canada."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"I use this pressure cooker at least twice a week. This gave me the option to cook healthy and/or flavorful meals in less than half the time of using an oven or slow cooker. I've made turkey lasagna, bbq pork shoulder,  and lots of chicken meals. I'm so glad we finally purchased one as time is no longer an excuse.  Only downside is getting the time setting right, which I still haven't mastered. 3 large frozen chicken breasts were overcooked on the poultry setting for 10 minutes. 5 medium size fresh chicken breasts were slightly overcooked at 7 minutes."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm loving this air fryer attachment for my Instant Pot because it's one less appliance I have to have on my counter. And, as Alton Brown says, it's not a Uni-tasker anymore. Not only does it air fry really well, but you can roast and bake small amounts in it too. Adding this on to my already greatly useful slow cooker, rice cooker, pressure cooker, etc. was the right choice. I find it easy to keep clean too as all the inside parts are dishwasher safe."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I don’t think it makes cooking go faster, which is why I bought it. But I love that I can just toss everything in and walk away and do something else. I don’t have to watch a pot. Our latest success story was boxed Mac and Cheese. We used the extra creamy one and followed a recipe we searched for online. Don’t judge it until you try it. Even the blue box haters in the house were eating it. No leftovers!!  And I didn’t have pots/strainers/boil overs etc to clean up afterwards."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I am in love with my pressure cooker! I have 4 kids & a husband so feeding 6 takes up time in the kitchen, BUT with this cooker time is cut more than half the time i use to stand in kitchen! Thank you for making this product! And it is safe! The 1st time i let the pressure out i did get scared because it made noise when air came out lol. But it's so easy to use!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm so glad I bought this instead of a fancy rice cooker. I hate spending a lot of money on gadgets and fancy cookware and I already had an electric pressure cooker I loved that someone gave me. It cooked great rice, tender beef stew, beans, soy sauce chicken, etc. but sometimes we needed two to have rice ready with the meal. We needed a time saver as we've just been cooking bastmati rice on the stove, and our cheapo rice cooker does a disservice to Asian rice, so my brother and sis-in-law gave me a new mid-grade fancy rice cooker for Christmas. To shorten the story, it came damaged and I returned it for a credit, but instead decided to spring for the Instant Pot at the last minute.This is truly an all in one device! I first read about the Instant Pot from Nom Nom Paleo and the great reviews on Amazon pushed me over to try it. You can program it to pressure cook grains, soups, porridge, meats, etc. but there's even a function for yogurt, and even slow cooking. It even comes with a sampling of recipes with a variety of cuisines, from Mediterranean to Asian! (I can't wait to try the Turnip Cake and the Creme Brulee in this!) Being a fusion Asian-America-Canadian family with all the members preferring different types of cuisines, it gave me great recipes to use besides just the standard SAD food and websites with tried and true pressure-cooker recipes to peruse. It's opened a whole new world of possibilities for me and I can't believe it but sometimes I wish I had two of these to use at the same time!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This IP is fantastic.I have had mine about 2 mos. and have made several dishes and a cheesecake. I have never had a bad experience with it, I wish I would have purchased it sooner. Don't be afraid, just try it, you will like it. You will find recipes for it everywhere, for everything. Enjoy.Thanks Amazon"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Game changer for this unmotivated mom/ chef. I've had this pot for over a month. Unboxed it and within a week I've become Gordon Ramsey....ok, I'm exaggerating, but you get the point. Oxtails in an hour, pot roast in 55 mins, any flavor game day wings in 20 mins, fresh fluffy rice in 5 mins, 10 minute spaghetti.... the list goes on. The instant pot community is ready and waiting with some of the best recipes too!!"
2.0 out of 5 stars,"I haven't used yet but missing multiple items that are supposed to be in the box.  Missing ""Rice Paddle, Soup Spoon, measuring cup"" which isn't that big of a deal but also missing the ""condensation collector"" which is unique to the Instant Pot.Will update review after first use."
5.0 out of 5 stars,This is one of those life changes products!  I had a large one but figured this was more my size with only one person so I sold mine to my sister and bought this one.  Must easier to handle and store but very little difference otherwise.  I cook all the time in this from hard boiled eggs (perfection) - to soups (fast and easy) - and the best thick cut pork chops I ever made.  Everyone needs this product.
3.0 out of 5 stars,I love the 8 quart I had a six before.  I don’t like how the silicone ring has to be tucked in around bracket.  I used a instapot/pressure cooker before and silicone ring was easy to come off and on.  The button could me more friendly user.  Not very clear which one adjust time and pressure.  It’s going to be a trial and learn.  I do wish I spent the extra money and bought the one I had prior.
5.0 out of 5 stars,10/10 would recommend. I would get the lower model in retrospect though. I have yet to use a premade timer.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This pot is such an improvement over the pressure cookers of old.  While there's a bit of a learning curve, it's worth it.  I've not tried other electronic pressure cookers, but if they're not stainless steel like the Instant Pot, then beware as I suspect it would wear out too fast!  One minor criticism is the design of the small plastic condensation catcher cup on the side...it seems difficult to attach and I also fear it might get damaged or lost easily.  We've used it about 10 times so far, and overall, my wife and I are very pleased.  Lots of great features...yogurt turned out nicely!  A solid 9.5 out of 10...a suggestion to the manufacturer to make it better would be to allow a user to designate the pressure (5/10/15 PSI)...which would then allow for pressure canning."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I was intimidated at first, but after aqua ting myself with the appliance, I was pleasantly surprised at how easy to use it is. I found the cooking guide that’s included isn’t nearly as helpful, but found lots of advice elsewhere. Very happy with my purchase."
5.0 out of 5 stars,i love this pot so fast cooking. cook roast and fixings in 1 hour. stove 4 or 5 hours. cooked bbq ribs in this pot so so tender. so glad i saw it on youtube. wonted to order and got it love this product. so so tender meats and even frozen meat. vegtable so tender and even corn on the cobb. you got to get one.
5.0 out of 5 stars,This is the fastest cooker and very easy to use. It is great for cheap cuts of meat and cooks so fast you won't believe how fast you can have dinner ready. I just made refried beans in 30 mins with not soaking them and they came out great. Be careful when cooking raw veggies they cook in about 10 mins. If you want to cook clean this is a great way to start. You can sear and cook your meat in the same pot. Clean up is so easy the insert comes out and is dishwasher safe.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love my Instant Pot.  So easy to use and so versatile.  Great time saver too. Once you have one, there are all sorts of groups you can join to get and share recipes."
1.0 out of 5 stars,"I used it once and it was great! Then, the second time I tried to cook the pot just kept beeping and blinking lid. The lid on/off sound no longer played and it didn't seem to recognize there was a lid attached.Will update once this situation is remedied."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"These are great! I have one in my motorhome and it’s extremely versatile to cook all types of things and easy to clean.  They are frequently on sale, I got mine on Prime Day for under 50 bucks!"

Just bought it; have already made potatoes, which I then mashed, hard-boiled eggs which peeled easily from shell without destruction, stew, with a programeable setting. Stew turned out perfectly today. So pleased beyond words, about this pot. I highly recommend it. Doesn't take up space as the larger sizes do. Perfect for my solo needs!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought one for each of my daughters.They each love it, and are comparing recipes.  I believe they are eating healthier.Both claim it saves them tons of time, and they cook stuff they otherwise wouldn't try."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love this thing. Pressure cooking, sauteeing, stewing, rendering bones into soup stock...I've used it a number of ways and it's stellar. I still can't imagine how it can bake a cake, but that will have to remain a mystery since I don't eat cake, (or bread either, Marie Antoinette)."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Save my life from keep calling food deliveries. You can cook rice, any kinds of meat, and soup by adding appropriate seasonings. I recommend to use star anise, ginger, dark soy sauce, as well as water to cook any meat (beef for 45 mins and chicken for 20 mins), and then cook the meat in a pan with olive oil and star anise, and then again add water, sea salt, ginger, dark soy sauce and any vegetables in the pan until the water was almost absorbed by the food. Then it's done!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love the Instant Pot.  I have been using stove top pressure cookers and slow cookers for years. I debated for a long while if I wanted to make this purchase.  To make a long story short, I now have two pressure cookers and 4 slow cookers on a shelf in the basement which will go to new homes.  I now have more space in my cupboards. Hoorah!!!  Back to the Instant Pot. New cooks, old cooks, Put aside your fears of using the Instant Pot.  It is very safe and food is just as tasty as a stove top pressure cooker or slow cooker."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Absolutely love this pot! I bought a “defected” one. It says there’s a major cosmetic defect on the surface of the pot. I thought fine, it’ll have little scratches anyways. But when I received the product, I could not find any scratches or dents on the surface or inside. Tried to make some stew and worked fine! I’m very happy with this pot, great value buy."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"I used this for the first time and really enjoyed it. The instructions in the recipe I tried suggested using the Manual button for the timer. This version of Duo doesn't have the ""Manual"" button so I had to Google the problem. You have to use the ""Pressure Cook"" button instead, which is fine. But the timer sound never went off, so I had to keep time separately. Also, even after washing and cleaning, I still smell some of the ingredients of my recipe. All in all, very pleased."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"First bought the 6 qt, eventually passed it on to other family member. No complaints- just more capacity than I needed for every day. Very happy with the mini."
2.0 out of 5 stars,"UPDATE: AMAZON IS AMAZING!  Their customer service is truly a dream!I have been so excited to try the instant pot, and from the 1.5 things made in it before it broke twice it was fantastic.  The pressure sensor was faulty so by mistake I contacted Instant pot's customer  service.  After emailing and having a turn around time of 24 hours between responses, and multiple questions plus sending multiple pictures of how it was malfunctioning  (including pictures of stickers with serial numbers cut in half, to prove i cut it in half) they agreed to send out another base.... 7 to 10 business days shipping (note i recieved this through Amazon prime 2 day shipping)  after recieving the new base a week and a half later I set it up excited to try again.... BUT the lid was still giving me issues(having to hold the pressure valve with hot pad to release pressure) again I went back to customer service who again requested pictures of the issue, asking what I was cooking, and the amount of water and if i pushed it this way.  I reminded them of the pictures.  They expressed how apologetic they were (really I felt more as though I was questioned over their faulty product more than helped) and now again have to wait another 5 to 10 business days to get a replacement piece for the faulty lid.  They say they are concerned about it being faulty but have not asked once to have it sent back to them to review.AGAIN I was so excited about this product and all the possibilities it had to offer but instant pot's customer service is extremely difficult to work with and here I am April 4th, and opened a problem with them middle of march and now will be waiting an additional 1.5 weeks to have a working appliance.NOTE TO SELF: never go through instant pot's customer service and work only with amazon who would have made this a quick and easy switch.  Shame on me going through the actual company.Once I am sent and used the actual non faulty product I am hoping to get the use and love everyone has for it.  Instant pot's customer service has truly left a pour taste in my mouth.  (The people I have talked to have been pleasant for the most part, other than the repetitive questioning of their own product, it is the process (or due diligence as was written to me via email) that is horrendous.)"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"My favorite kitchen appliance, does everything! Great for food prep, complete family meals and saves a ton of time. Buy one, you won’t regret it!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Takes a bit of getting used to, in that it's easy, fast, and convenient. No stirring dinner, just put in in and walk away. No soaking beans!Once I had a single grain of rice (in the wrong spot) prevent it from getting to pressure properly, but once I took the cover off and removed the grain, it was fine.One option I don't like is it is set so once it's done cooking, it keeps it warm for you until you shut it off.  This is good for delaying cook time for when returning from work or something. However, I would prefer the option of once being cooked, to shut off automatically."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"If you want fast, good cooked food - this is your product.  Had another person who owns one tell me about her's and I thought well I would try it  - and it does exactly what all you read says it does.  So many recipes out there to try out and so far all has been good for me and this lil wonder!!  When your hours worked are long - this is the magic tool to still make a great meal to eat at home and keep you from buying take out and fast food.  You can eat more healthy people - give it a try."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have had different stove top pressure cookers. This is by far the safest, most effective and efficient.I love the fact that:1.I don't have to stand around waiting for it to build pressure and then lower2. It doesn't release much steams- less than two minutes3. It doesn't heat up the house4. It doesn't stink up the place5. The inner pot is so easy to cleanWhen the minutes count down to zero and beeps, I unplug and let it self depressurized. Hopefully it save me of my energy costs."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Bought and first meal was pulled pork, we didn't even need to shred it since it just fell apart. Second meal was ribs and we where almost able to just pull the bones out. Can't believe I waited so long to get one."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"I never thought that instant pot could do so good that even exceeds my expectation! I'm always using STAUB for the meat stew, it did pretty well in stewing but cost 1 hour for 1lb beef/pork. Instant Pot just shorten that time to 20 min with the same result!One thing I don't like is the smell after cooking. After cooking the meat, the pot remains the smells of the seasoning. Even though I washed it several times, the smell can't be washed off."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Gave this to my daughter-in-law for Christmas!! SHE LOVES IT!  She doesn't get home until 5:00 and this is so quick and helpful for her! Now I think I need to buy one! The small one is just big enough to feed 3-4 people, with no left overs. She uses it several times a week, so it stays on her counter!"
4.0 out of 5 stars,"So far I ❤ my new toy IP so much. My IP delivered on Feb 13, after 4 days I had my IP  used it to tried make "" Bah Kut Teh"" ... it's really turn out so yummy. Today I will it to make "" Hong Xiu Yuk"" it also come out so good and tasty..... I give 4 stars it just because I still a bit not clear about how to use it. But I plan to order one for my mom deliver it to Malaysia. And I also recommended this product to my best friend, she also think get one for herself and one for her mom. 😊 It's really make your cooking easy😉"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love, love, love. I was hesitant to purchase this as I have a very small kitchen and I’m staunchly opposed to trendy appliances. But, I needed help making bone broth to comply with a healing regimen, and this clearly seemed like the best product on the market.It’s a pleasure to prepare meat, soup, and stock in this - and the yogurt making function makes preparing homemade yogurt a breeze. I put the ingredients for yogurt in just before bed so that th batch or yogurt is ready by breakfast time.I appreciate all of the safety features, the very thoughtful design, and the different cooking temperature (and pre-set cooking temperature programs) that this programmable pressure cooker provides.As someone who likes and needs to cook regularly - who lives in a place without central heat/AC (i.e. no system for bringing fresh air inside on days when it is too hot or cold to have the windows open) - this easy to use pressure cooker has literally improved my health and quality of life."
5.0 out of 5 stars,Nice to have a more modest-sized pot that does multiple functions.  The searing setting works beautifully.  The pressure cooking setting also works quite well.  And the size is so much better for a family of 2-4 than the huge models that take up a lot of space.
4.0 out of 5 stars,has instructions on how to use with water on a trial run and a very limited chart on cooking times.  No hint on how to make any of the food in advertisement. Had to purchase recipe books online to find out how to make meals.
1.0 out of 5 stars,Pressure valve does not activate on its own. After 21 minutes I have to press on the lid to get the valve to come up! (EVERY TIME) piece of crap deal of the day. It's great once it gets up to pressure
4.0 out of 5 stars,"Have used it several times.  Only downside is the basket is small, so if you're feeding more than 3 people, you will have to do several batches.  Otherwise, it is great!"
1.0 out of 5 stars,"I worked for a little over one year. Used it about 12 times. After that, won't hold pressure!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,I purchased Instant Pot DUO80 nearly 17 months ago and have loved it since day one.  After using it at least 2 times per week for nearly 2 years I started having issues with the steam value opening a few minutes after the pressure button went up.  Appears to have been an issue with either the heating element or pressure sensor.  I called customer service and explained the issue on May 13th.  After a couple of email and images sent they happily offered to send a new cooker base.  I expected to have some push back due to it being nearly 2 years old but they were very proactive in making sure I was satisfied with their product.  Even better the new cooker base arrived on May 17th.  4 day turn around... crazy.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Only thing I could wish for is if I had this earlier. As Korean, my family loves stews and soup but sometimes I have to stand infront of the stove for up to 4 hours simmering and watching for over flow and wiping all the steam around the stove top it was so time consuming and what a mess! Now i could make a oxtail broth in as little as 30 min with the meat falling off the bone!! I have nothing to complain it is such a joy to cook now :)"
5.0 out of 5 stars,After seeing much hype online and my old pressure cooker starting to go out I knew I had to have this product.  I did a bunch of research into which of the models I wanted and finally decided on the DUO60 after having the added feature of the yogurt maker.  The first thing I made with it was white rice.  It was so easy to use.  There is a Rice button and it made the white rice perfectly.  The inner bowl is removable which made for easy cleanup.  It came with various tools as well.  I can see that this will get a lot of use in my kitchen.
5.0 out of 5 stars,Okay this only for the air fryer lid and it is a game changer; it is so amazing and let me tell you the first week I had I use for every day. It is a convection oven okay now I just wish that it was bigger but I will work with little space. It saved me from buying another machine when I am using what I already have.
5.0 out of 5 stars,Wonderful! It really lives up to all the hype. You can put the lid on and walk away without your food being burned or needing stirred. Saves time and the best part... fewer dishes to do after! It's amazingly fast! The only thing I wish it came with is some sort of manual to tell you the times you should cook things. I have been having to look up online recipes to figure out how long to set it for.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"We have been very impressed.  It has done great as a slow cooker, rice maker and pressure cooker.  Easy to use and great meals.  The Insta pot community on Facebook is great for recipe suggestions.One unexpected added feature is dessert maker - tasty cheese cakes and lava cakes have come out of our pot.As an update - we use more and more often.  Wife likes it for hard boiled eggs too!"
3.0 out of 5 stars,"It's so big there is almost nowhere to store it.  Unless you plan to keep this out on your counter, or you have a huge storage space, you may wish you had just stuck with your crock pot. I kept it, but if I had realized how big it was i would have not purchased it."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"The best thing since sliced bread.The instant pot is amazing! We use it several times a week. You can throw almost anything in and somehow it infuses all the flavors and spices perfectly. Creates some of the most delicious meals. In addition, you can just throw in frozen meat and it cooks it perfectly. Now that is incredible!!!! No waiting to defrost or headache if you forget to defrost dinner first. Just throw it all in and push a button, walk away, and in about 30 mins you have the best dinner ever!Cooks vegetables perfectly every time!Bought all my family members one for Christmas, it is that amazing and a must have!Not sure what else to say. Its amazing!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,The 8 qt is worth the extra few bucks. I love my crock pot but this thing really takes crock potting to the next level.  There is a small learning curve using an instant pot if you're use to traditional cooking or crock potting so watch a youtube video and read the instructions.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I don't usually write reviews, but this product deserve it.I do most of my cooking with it.It almost doesn't make noiseThe smell of the food is minimum, compare with the regular presure cooker.Its very safe.The meat come tender, I cook oxtail, tongue, shoulder etc etc etc.The rice come in minutes and well done.And if you do live in a hot place, its excellent, because you don't need to heat more your house to cook.I just love it.I hope that I could help you with my review."
1.0 out of 5 stars,My heating element burnt out in three months.  It formed a big bubble and eventually just popped.  They won’t repair this one or send me the parts.  I have to send them my pot and wait for them to replace it.  I’m just going out to buy another manufacturer’s product.  If I didn’t need it I wouldn’t have bought it!  It is reficulous that I have to wait till I send mine in before they send me a new one!
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Haven't used this for very long, We had a cuisinart that started leaking after 6 months. Hope this one lasts longer. The presets are nice and plays some fun tones when you open and close the lid. So far this is a better cooker than the cuisinart we had. We use pressure cookers for so many things, it's amazing. But they are expensive so they need to last more than 6 months"
1.0 out of 5 stars,"I don’t like it at all .Poor quality ,my food is getting burned at the bottom for all recipes.tried adding more oil and water still same thing happening again again .very disappointed with this."
2.0 out of 5 stars,"This is one of those fad gadgets that is used a couple of times and then sits in the cabinet, taking up space. I've used it for cooking and for keeping a dish warm at a potluck. Not impressed with it as a cooking device. I'd much prefer a pot on the stove or a manual pressure cooker. For slow-cooking (or warming), it's OK, but for its capacity it's much bulkier than a normal slow cooker. Meh..."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love this machine. No, it won't replace all of your small appliances.  But, find a few go-to recipes (for me they're mac 'n cheese and ribs, so far) and it'll cut cooking time by loads (45 mins to fall-off-the-bone ribs)"
4.0 out of 5 stars,"I use this every other day.  I am still learning so I have had success and failure.  It seems like the BURN display happens more than it should.  Every time that I get this message, it has scorched the bottom and I was able to salvage by moving to a new pot.  I may be doing something wrong but I was hoping the pot would be ""set it and forget it""."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I waited (months) to buy an Instant Pot on Black Friday, and I was not disappointed. I've made a couple of meals and ""boiled"" a dozen eggs with it so far; this piece of glorious culinary excellence has not let me down. Super fast, super easy, and delicious meals! If you like to eat this bad boy needs to be in your kitchen."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I was skeptical, and hate kitchen gadgets. I bought one for my daughter and decided to get one for myself.  After making a couple recipes in it I'm a total fan. Chicken tortilla soup, pulled bbq chicken, rice, etc. I love it. So quick to cook, and easy to clean. I'm looking forward to making yogurt and cheesecake in it  ;0"
2.0 out of 5 stars,Not reliable got damaged product . Food always burned even after following the instructions. Pasta turned out like soup . Product showed always food burned even when there was sufficient water and oil . Couldn't return .so now stuck with high priced pot which cannot be replaced
5.0 out of 5 stars,Bought this to replace my old slow cooker and pressure cooker.  It cooks very quickly and quietly.  I haven't even begun to figure out all the food that can be prepared in it!  Got a great price on Amazon with quick delivery.
2.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased this product brand new.  When i purchased, it was for efficiency because i had a family in ICU in a hospital.  During the entire summer, i used only the preassure cooking feature.  My pre-soaked lentils would not cook even after 30 mins use.  I abandoned the process due to other emergencies.During Christmas and Jan, i tried all the features and only sautee works.  The yogurt cameout like a fermented slurry and it was light yellow so i threw everything.  Pre-soaked chickpease under high preassure did not soften but were crunch after 45 mins time.  i am past the return period so  i am stuck with a 70 expense."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love this product. I cook everything in it, from meat to vegetables. Really great for rice also. My favorite feature is the sauté setting."
5.0 out of 5 stars,I love this part. It makes cooking so easy. My family loves it too. Absolutely no complaints here
5.0 out of 5 stars,"There’s a reason for the success of this pressure cooker, and it’s not just the viral Facebook stuff. I think there is a place for the stovetop cooker still, but for ease of use you just can’t beat this. I had a “Power Cooker” electric I think the brand was and the quality was just horrible. These are worth the money even if you only used it to hard boil a few eggs each week, not even counting the endless supply of recipes out there."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love my instant pot. The chilli it makes is to die for and the pulled pork is so fast and easy, but also super tender. Not a fan of the stainless liner that comes with it, so I recommend upgrading that to the non stick one, I think it's only like $30 on amazon. But that makes cooking and cleaning so easy with this thing."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I cannot even begin to say how excited I am about this pressure cooker!  I live in the desert southwest and was looking for something to cook meals in without going in and out to use grill, oven, or stove top.  Esp when temps are 117° +.  Let me tell you, this fits the bill. 100%!  The ease of use.  Hard boiled eggs in 6 minutes WHAT?! It's TRUE!  ONE pot meals. From searing meats, adding liquid, veggies, turn on and walk away.  1 hr later, supper.  One pot, less mess.  Perfect rice. If you are afraid of blowing a hole in your ceiling, no worries , safety feature built in to prevent such a mishap.I could go on and on, I'll spare you. Order up and see for yourself.  You won't regret it."
1.0 out of 5 stars,I hardly used this product but I cannot set the timer to cook for longer than 3 minutes and if I try to set for one second longer it resets and I have to push the + button to regain every second until it reaches 3 minutes and then it resets again.  This Insta Pot is USELESS to me !!!
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I am so happy with my IP-DUO60 Instant Pot.  I was blown away with how good my brown rice turned out.  2 cups brown rice, 2-3/4 cups water and a little salt.  Manual high pressure for 22 mins, sit on warm for 10 mins. then release steam.  It was perfect!  I have made a few of my slower cooker recipes in the pressure cooker and they have turned out as good, if not better, than my slow cooker versions.Yesterday, I made black beans from dry and, again, delicious.  I've never had much luck cooking black beans on the stove, not to mention the time it takes soaking plus cooking.  But the ones out of my Instant Pot are delicious.  I did add onion, cumin, chili powder and some other things.  The spices did not over power the beans.I am so happy with the stainless steel insert.  It is a substantial pot, not flimsy in the least.The only downfall, and it's tolerable, is that it takes about 10 minutes to reach pressure.  Sometimes I heat my liquids in the microwave before adding and that helps a bit.  Bringing it back up to pressure after adding items seems to be quicker also."
2.0 out of 5 stars,"I only tried the yogurt making, and it did not work at all. Very bad written instructions."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I am an owner of 6 QT and it was always just little but not enough for our family of 7. Now when I have 8 QT problem is resolved. It takes about the same time to cook as with 6QT, just preheating takes a little bit longer, may be 1-2 minutes longer. Perfect size to prepare soup for 7, to cook 6lbs chicken and to cook enough meal for dinner for our large family. While I amstill using 6QT for stew and other similar staff, 8QT is a mast for the large family!"
3.0 out of 5 stars,"Mainly updated to this version for the yogurt function but was very disappointed. The boil setting doesn’t get it up to the required temperature, so I still have to stand there with the sauté function to get it where it needs to be. I should have just gotten a second inner pot for the LUX version I already had."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I just cooked pot roast for the very first time in my life, I always wanted to do this but was scared I might ruin it.  Seared the meat ,took it out cooked onions put the pot roast and added liquid,then added  vegetables ,but they came out a little soft but was ok for me , then one hour cooking time, and I couldn’t believe it that meat was falling off so TENDER unbelievable!!! I love this Insta pot ,  can’t wait to make more"
1.0 out of 5 stars,Everything I try to do gives me the BURN error and no matter what I do I cannot complete a cooking cycle. Worst purchase ever. I must have a dud.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Bought it as a gift this time. The last one was given to me as a gift and I left it in the garage for months. I took it out and used it a few times, It is the best addition of 2017. I have one and use it daily now. It has crept into our routines almost daily, which is crazy because I generally do things the hard way rather than tinker with a new device. But this is so easy you would be a fool not to! You don't even have to peel, just put stuff in and peel later."
5.0 out of 5 stars,This is the one stop shop kitchen appliance and I absolutely adore it. Also safer than the other models because it has a button to release steam versus a handle you touch. I use it to cook my family meals at least 3 times a week (this is because it makes leftovers so technically it makes every meal!)
5.0 out of 5 stars,We love our instapot. I bought this for my wife for Christmas last year and she looked at me like I was crazy we needed a new crock pot but I had heard so many good things about an instant that I thought I would get her one. She went from thinking I was crazy to being crazy about the pressure cooker she tells all of her friends and makes me buy one for every wedding that we go to. We use ours 3 to 4 times a week. It's nice to be able to come home and throw some stuff together and put it in the pressure cooker and have it cook in a fraction of the time that it would normally take to cook.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love the pressure cooking ability. So versital. Use it at least once a week. Clean up is a breeze with the removable  stainless steel pot. Very happy. Homemade chicken soup in no time and THE best, most tender roasts ever (pork and beef). Chicken is always moist and juicy. I have no reservations recommending this one to friends. Love it!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,This unit is as close to a perfect pressure cooker as I could ever want. The only complaint I have is that it's a little difficult to get the food odors out of the main unit as the design makes it somewhat difficult to get into the nooks and crannies to clean. Other than that--a virtually perfect cooking tool.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love my instant pots. I have the 3,6,8. They are all different models but they all function very similarly. Makes getting dinner together so much quicker when you don’t have the time to stand and watch your food. Really saved me in the months after I had my son and had so little time."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This was a purchase on Cyber Monday.  It was a GREAT deal so we bought it even though we had another that we use all the time.It was good we did as we ended up giving it as a gift to family that didn't have one but always heard great things.  We also bought one for our college kids so they can cook meals faster.You do have a learning curve in using this so read recipes when first using to get the hang of times needed, water amount, etc.  If you start off with trial and error method, you will get lots of errors and will end up not liking it as much."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"I am a person that does not cook, I mean hardly ever.  We live full time in a motorhome and this is the best cooking item I have bought to date.  It makes everything so fast and easy.  I actually bought bagged rice and bagged beans.  Something I have not done in 20 years.  It all cooked so quickly and tasted wonderful.  I gave 4 stars because it does take a little bit to figure out.  The instructions are a little complicated but liked the online recipe book."
3.0 out of 5 stars,"I was really looking forward to getting this item. It came exactly when it was supposed to. But when it came, it had a huge dent on the side. Now I have to return it and wait for a replacement to come AND deal with returning this defective one. So upset to have to go through all this for the price you pay."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have been watching this item for awhile, it's been on my wish list for over a year. Thank you Black Friday!!! I pulled the trigger and bought this, was so excited for the package to be delivered today. Got it from the mail woman's hands, tore into it and there it was in its glory. Decided we would have green chile chicken and beans.  In an hour, my frozen chicken, frozen green chile and dry beans were done to absolute perfection! I live at high altitude, so I adjusted my cooking time to accommodate this, and again, it was a perfect, delicious dinner."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have lots of kitchen gadgets that sit in a closet, never to be used. This is not one of them. I try new recipes all the time and I am continually amazed at the finished product. My chicken caccitore has never been better!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,This pot changed my life! As a mother of three children I cook a lot. This saves me so much time. I can cook a pot of dry beans perfectly in 30 minutes! It’s amazing! I purchased as a warehouse deal and I’m so happy that I did as it arrived perfect with no damage. Thank you Amazon for the amazing savings!
2.0 out of 5 stars,"This unit does the quick pressure cooking pretty well, though I don't like adding that much water to my recipes.  It isn't very good at slow cooking.  My usual Mississippi Pot Roast comes out too wet on pressure cooking, and too tough on slow cooking.  I am going back to my crock pot - I'd rather take a little longer and make something really good."
5.0 out of 5 stars,I have wanted an instant pot for a long time. I finally decided to purchase one. This is the most amazing kitchen gadgets to have. You can cook ONE POT dishes in it. Less dishes makes this momma happy! It also cooks things very quickly and is easy to use. There are a ton of recipes to try. I have used it everyday since buying.
5.0 out of 5 stars,This is my 3rd IP. The other 2 are still working. I  wanted another 6 qt for when the one is tied up all day making yogurt. I love love love that you can turn off the sound on this one. Love all of the presets. This is definitely an upgrade from my Duo. The price on Amazon prime day was just too good to pass up! Am glad I got it.
5.0 out of 5 stars,Awesome deal fast delivery
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've been eyeing this product for a while comsidiering the great reviews it's gotten. I got it during the Cyber Monday sale and I'm so sorry I didn't get it sooner! Using its pressure cooker has halved by cooing time! I've made Mac and cheese, pasta, oatmeals, soups, stews, meats, etc.It's not just a pressure cooker though. It's also a slow cooker, rice maker, yogurt maker, etc. it may look intimidating at first, but if you follow the instructions, it's very difficult to mess this thing up.There's only one downside to this product and it's that the silicone ring attracts odors. While these odors don't transfer to the taste of the food, it is an annoyance, and with the proper cleaning, they can greatly reduced.This product does go on sale from time to time, so I reccomend waiting until it does so. This is one of the best kitchen products I've brought and highly recommend anyone who does a lot of coming gets this!"

Go ahead buy it, ill wait. .......got it? Ok good job. Enjoy."
3.0 out of 5 stars,I purchased this pot to save my cooking time at home. Unfortunately it doesn’t do much though. I have another pressure cooker which works fine and I was hoping instant pot would be smarter than my old one but not.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"LOVE my InstaPot!!! Cooks everything fast and taste great! Love that I can even put meat in frozen. Also, cooks soups fast and they taste like they have cooked all day."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Oh my gosh, believe there hype. This really will change your (cooking) life! I have made so many recipes already and I've only had it for a few weeks. I just love how fast and almost foolproof the instant pot cooks things. I never considered getting one, and when my husband asked me if I wanted one, I told him I didn't need it, but he convinced me that it was far superior to my old reliable crock pot, and I'm SO glad he did. Seriously, just get it."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I cant say enough!!! This IS the most amazing machine EVER!!!!I am not a great cook and am an empty nester now. This machine makes me look like a Rock Star .. lol.I have made everything in it; Ribs, Cheesecake, Chili, Pasta n Meatballs, Soup, Barley Stew, steamed vegetables, a Whole Chicken, cut up turkey,man, you name it .. it works!! I hardly ever use my stove anymore. And AND it is cost effective. My electricity hasn't gone up all that much, but my gas usage has gone down and my bill is still the same.It is worth the cost....get one!!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I absolutely love this product! I have since bought the instant pot bible and accessories to go with it. I rarely use my stove or oven. It comes with enough to cook almost everything, spend a little more for the extra accessories and you can cook almost anything you want, including desserts! It takes a little work to learn how to use as any pressure cooker but an absolutely amazing product!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my second electric pressure pot - I also have a Magic Chef - both have stainless steel pot liners - which is a great feature - cook - soak and rinse clean.  The non-stick are so unhealthy and end up peeling.  This Insta Pot has great add-on accessories, which I ordered extra sealer rings, glass lid, and extra stainless pot liner.I utilize the Insta Pot between 4 and 8 times a week.  I also have the Insta Pot cook book - handy to help learn to use the pot effectively and get creative.  Can't go wrong with this product - definitely 5 stars."
5.0 out of 5 stars,After having the Instant Pot for 6 months now. I know I will always have a pressure cooker. It's amazing and super easy to use. Easy to clean. Is a MUST for any working person who wants to eat home cooked food after work. Amazing. Such a time saver. And the recipes that take longer (like the most fall off the bone ribs you have ever eaten) are also worth it for a weekend meal that is better than a restaurant. Love this thing! Buy one!
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great for small batches of french fries, onion rings, etc. Very easy to clean."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased this Instant Pot for my daughter-in-law.  I have the 6qt model and have been using mine a lot.  The larger size is great for families or if you are making larger portions.  She's been enjoying her Instant Pot and it's been fun sharing recipes.  It's very easy to use and cuts cooking time to a fraction of the time using conventional methods.  I love that you can saute right inside the pot.  It's truly a one pot cooker, so you don't dirty tons of pots and pans."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have never pressure cooked in my life. Somehow, I stumbled upon the Instant Pot in a vegan Facebook group, and I looked into it, saw how popular it was, read the rave reviews, and purchased one on Prime Day.I was so excited to make my first potatoes, beans and rice in it, and then move onto soups and more complicated recipes.  After watching numerous YouTube videos, joining two Instant Pot Facebook groups and ordering a lifesaving pressure cooker cookbook, (and after a few panicky moments, and bursting into fearful tears, feeling like I'd never understand pressure cooking, so I posted many questions in said Facebook groups, which saved me)There is a learning curve with this, but I kept at it and I use it multiple times per week.I'm vegan and my husband is diabetic, and I'm always cooking separate meals for us, and the IP saves me so much time.  Food is more flavorful. I absolutely love it and use it constantly.  Grains, beans, potatoes, soup, rice, Brussels sprouts... Everything is delicious.  I even bought a second one on cyber Monday!  I brought it to my sister's house to cook dinner and demonstrate how great it is, and dinner cooked itself while we played Yahtzee."
5.0 out of 5 stars,I love the versatility of this kitchen appliance! With so many functions its easy to just throw in a last minute meal and have it ready so quickly!The IP is pretty easy to clean making it easy to go from making the main meal and then using it to make sides! Love this thing and will most likely buy the smaller 3qt!
4.0 out of 5 stars,"Interesting way to cook.  I like this pot.  Sometimes I have a hard time getting it up to pressure sometimes but that may be because I don't have enough liquid in the pot.  Chicken is phenomenal in this thing.  Lasagna is good too.  Pot Roast was tricky.  Cleanup is kind of a pain because of the unit itself.  The Stainless Steel Pot is no problem (dish washer), but the rim of the unit is tough to get really clean.  It still smells like whatever you cooked last until you cook something else.Overall happy though."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Wow!!!  Yes, I am using exclamation marks, so you, the reader, can see I am almost hanging off the chandelier and shouting to the world about this Instant Pot Pressure Cooker (++++++++) Duo 6qts 9-in-1!!! I got it on Cyber Monday here on Amazon, for a crazy wonderful price and received it 2 days later.  My breathless wait was worth every minute.  I already made chicken soup (from the Milk Street show), curry chicken, Vietnamese Pho, Yogurt (the best I've ever made, and it was the easiest! Husband said it tasted more like sour cream! which is a compliment to me), Apple Sauce, steamed potatoes in it for what turned out to be the most amazing Russian Style Potato Salad (Olivie), and the list goes on.Hint: I am sure it's been mentioned a million times already, but one more time won't hurt: BUY EXTRA SILICONE RINGS.  The rings do retain aroma / odor from whatever is being cooked.  So I now have 3 separate rings in diff. colors: 1 for Yogurt, 1 for savory and 1 for sweets.  Absolutely amazing product, I am using practically on daily basis, makes my life easier (one pot most of the time) and the food comes out fantastic. All my friends saw this thing now, and wanting one for themselves.  I Highly Recommend"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Have been reviewing and researching about the Instant Pot. I am a Huge fan of NomNom Paleo & The Domestic Man. I have made quite a few recipes and they have all turned out fantastic. My granddaughter LOVES mac and cheese(she is not Paleo) but I can make it for her in less than 10 minutes or she can make it. So easy to use. Love the ease of use, and it's not scary like the stove-top cookers are. Also loved the stainless steel insert could be put in dishwasher, I don't like using a teflon coated or any type of ""coated product"" to cook in because it will come off at some point. If you are thinking about or just starting to research, STOP and buy this, well worth it. Best price here on Amazon and it arrived very quickly."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great product once you get the accessories to go with it. Being a product for people new to Instant pot, a few accessories that everyone knows are needed would go a long way! Include 5 Star recipes right in the box would have been nice.This is a great product but adding a few things more with it would have been nice."
1.0 out of 5 stars,"First of all I loved my old instant pot and it lasted years. I bought the duo plus 60 in July and I do not like the detachable plug. I get a connection and then it shuts off, I am left wondering when did it shut off, how long did it work for? I really have to tweak the cord for it even to come on. I wouldn't trust it to slow cook  as I wouldn't know if it had worked or not. So no I don't recommend this version at all. Please bring back with the attached plug. Update. It ended up in the graveyard of useless appliances."
1.0 out of 5 stars,It got this in February 2020 and used it twice.  The non stick coating is starting to peel off of the inside of the Air Fryer Basket that comes with the lid.  I think this is unsafe as that is where you place the food.  Have contacted Instant Pot for replacement of Basket twice but still no reply.  I would think that Instant Pot customer service would be better than that.
5.0 out of 5 stars,Super easy to clean. Very handy kitchen appliance.  I use it almost daily and being in a camper I have to be selective with any appliance I purchase and I'm very pleased.  Tons of recipes to find online and the ease and saved time makes it a huge win.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Our normal pressure cooking pot was the basic stove pot pressure cooker. The Instant Pot Duo is amazing. Just set the time and cook away. Everything cooked comes out as expected. Anyway, the old pressure cooker was turned into a car troubleshooting leak test smoke machine."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great product. Takes a little practice but great product. Great for beef roasts, Italian beef sandwiches, pork loins, chicken breasts. I recommend getting on a Facebook page with lots of recipes and advice."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"How fun is this pot....!?!? LOVE IT!! Totally changed the way I cook. Throw meat in with some liquid, press start, done. Truly that easy. Frozen tilipia, little marinade, 5 minutes, perfection. Brown beans, soak over night, liquid to cover, onion, ham, dry French onion packet, 30 minutes, done, perfection. Rice, 12 min, perfection. I am ready to do an infomercial for this pot!! Seriously...I have been chucking random meat from my freezer in this just for fun. FROZEN chicken breast, cranberry sauce, French dressing, onion soup mix packet, 15 minutes, fantastic (serve over rice)."
1.0 out of 5 stars,"Received my Instant Pot on Dec. 24,2018 and immediately started using it and loved the quick, healthy meals I could make. However, it quit as I was making soup on March 4th, 2019. We have contacted Instant Pot, and they had a list of several requirements before they would send a replacement. We sent the photos and copy of the Amazon receipt that they asked for, but have not heard anything back from them. I would look for another brand of the same type of pressure cooker."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Where do I start? Since moving to Georgia, my spring/summer/fall cooking has taken a hit. I cannot bring myself to make the weekly soups, stews and roasts that my family enjoys. Instant Pot has changed that. Just last night, I cooked 12 pounds of chicken drums in three batches, easily stripped the meat, and then returned the bones and skin to the pot to make stock. All of this was done in under 3 hours and it did not noticeably heat up my kitchen. The pot requires about 10 minutes to build up steam/pressure but one it has, stews/soups/stocks are done in 30 minutes and perfect rice take 11-15 minutes. I have yet to use the yogurt or pasteurization setting but the sauteing function is awesome!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Cook everything in it. If you don't have one, get one. Threw away our crock pot, rice cooker, other stuff that it can do.  Bought a couple as gifts, friends love them. What more is there to say? Don't buy the cheap knock offs....."
5.0 out of 5 stars,Im in love with this thing!So many options on what to make. Little tricky converting reg. Recipes..Love it tho. Get one!Its nice not heating up the whole house for the oven.. i havnt used my oven in over 2 months now.. we have a toaster oven. And this thing.. i dont need a stove!
1.0 out of 5 stars,"I’ve had it for over a year but I’ve only used it like 10 or 15 times. After I had a baby I decided it would be great to start using it on a regular basis,so I could cook fast and healthy. I turned it on and noticed that the lid wouldn’t seal,my friend told me that it was probably just the silicone ring that was needed to be changed,so I ordered new rings but it still wouldn’t seal. And then I noticed that the part of sealing ring rack was broken. I tried calling the customer service to see if they could tell me what to do but the line was always busy. I tried to see if I could order a new lid online but they had it out of stock.I guess I’ll just have to find a better pressure cooker."
5.0 out of 5 stars,I love love love love love love love love love my instant potEnough said.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"What a piece of crap, it burns everything. After doing everything they say to stop it from burning; replacing ring, making sure pan is clean, making sure lip is clean, making sure pot is clean.... it still burns everything. The burn alarm goes off when only water is in the pot!! AVOID!!!!! AT ALL COSTS!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"i LOVE this thing. it cooks everything tasty, fast and melt in your mouth. haven't tried the yogurt maker or the slow cooker. but i love the pressure cooker and the saute functions. one of the best investments i have ever made."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I really do love this machine and all its capabilities. I only hesitated as a I didn’t want one more device on my counter. I have made chicken, rice few times a whole spaghetti squash twice and can’t wait to keep trying out recipes. Everything has been perfect. A friend made the hummus and she said it was super delish. Will be adding to my list soon."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"If I did it again, I would order the 6 Qt version for a family of 4. I love the leftovers, but it takes a long time to come up to pressure. The smaller pots are a little speedier. I would recommend the larger pot if you entertain large groups or are looking to cook large quantities for leftovers. Otherwise, your 6 Qt will do the trick for the average family."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I wanted an air fryer ,but really don't need another appliance ,my kitchen isn't huge.This works great ,I made salmon and jalapeno poppers so far.Works like a charm!If you already have an instant pot this is a fantastic addition."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"So far so good!  I've been wanting an Instant Pot for a while...I hate cooking and I have a terrible time planning ahead sometimes, but this thing makes cooking fast and fun!!  There are so many recipes online that you'll never run out of options, and you won't have to buy a cookbook!  I've started cooking more since this came into my life, which makes my kids really happy!  My kids each cook dinner one night a week, so they have enjoyed using this, too!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is one of the most useful ""kitchen gadget"" I've ever owned.  As a slow cooker, it's great, and does just what it should (so easily replaces my crock pot). The other stuff though - especially the pressure cooking for rehydrating dried beans quickly, and the yogurt making function - that's where this thing really shines.  I really love my instant pot (and I'm typing this having just woken up to perfectly cooked steel cut oatmeal, ready for me in the morning having put in oats and milk and set the timer the night before)."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've bought a lot of kitchen gadgets over the years, and most end up collecting dust within 6 months. My instant pot is used at least once a week, sometimes up to 4x a week. It's incredibly versatile, super easy to clean, and while a bit bulky is well worth the space it takes up in one of the easily accessible cupboards because you'll be using it very often."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Wonderful machine. We use it all the time. And You Tube has hundreds of videos & how to's.  Always fun to experiment. Almost impossible to screw up anything. Stainless steel inner pot is a breeze to clean. Hint: Buy the glass lid, remove the inner pot & the leftovers go right in the fridge!!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love it, between this and air fryer, we bever use the oven. This is one of the best inventions for the kitchen in decades."
2.0 out of 5 stars,"The lid on my instant pot hardly ever seals properly.  The flexible ring seal was pinched one time.  Every other time it is perfect and I still end up with disasters due to the steam escaping, never coming up to pressure, and burning food to the bottom.  I do not recommend."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Now that I have my instant pot I may never use a crock pot again.  I love this thing!!!  I've made soups, meatloaf, BBQ, baked potatoes, pasta dishes, and frozen chicken.  Making a cheesecake today!  I've had it less than a month and used it more than any other device I own outside of my Keurig!  ;). It's easy to use, easy to clean, does what it says it does... what more can I want!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"It's not a complete replacement for a pressure cooker... It's not big enough and doesn't have enough pressure for canning.  Still, this thing works great and can do just about everything else.  The pressure function really reduces cooking time.  I love this gadget."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great product! Easy to install, easy to keep n doesn't occupy too much space.Great to cook any type of cuisine - Indian, American, Italian etc. The meat cooked in this pot turns out to be very juicy n flavorful! Definitely recommend buying it."
1.0 out of 5 stars,Think I got a dud. Will be returning. Doesn't work !!! Did pressure test and nothing
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Gave this to our daughter as a gift. She was kind of skeptical at first, but has learned how to use it. Enjoys using at least  3-4 times weekly to prepare meals quickly."
5.0 out of 5 stars,Love all the versatile features. Makes the most delicious food and quickly. Came on time with received as promised. One of the main tools I use the kitchen now. Why did I wait for so long?!!
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I jumped on the bandwagon after reading so many posts on Facebook of people saying the Instant Pot was a game changer in the kitchen.  I was skeptical....and I don't like a lot of kitchen appliances out on my counters but this has been a GREAT addition to my kitchen.  I've made perfect brown  rice in about half the time of a conventional steamer...made chicken, beef dishes, ribs and it is a favorite for the boiled egg! Perfect eggs with no icky green ring EVERY time!I am so glad I purchased this! Fun to use...and mess is a minimum!"
4.0 out of 5 stars,"I finally got one on Prime Day and I justified it because it's easier to work in with other cooking processes. It has an automatic shut-off, hold warm feature so it can be incorporated into a roast, baking , or other process in meal preparation. I admit I had buyer's remorse because I have a perfectly good manual one."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've used this pot a few times now since purchasing it, and I really like it. I was worried it would be difficult to clean, especially using it to sauté meat, but the pot always comes clean easily. Cleaning the lid is easy as well. I was also concerned that I'd find it frustrating to use, but the learning curve was far less steep than I had feared. After just a few uses, I no longer need to consult the manual. I went with the larger unit in order to be able to put a full-size chicken in it, and a whole chicken fits fine."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought another brand crockpot and I coudn't get it to seal. This one worked right out of the box. Delicious beans have been cooked so far. I would recommend setting them for a little longer, but this thing is great. Love it."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Pressure cooking is back!!!  Locks in the flavor and nutrients while cutting down on the amount of time needed to prepare all kinds of dishes.  This pot is also a slow cooker, rice cooker, porridge maker, sauté pan and canning pot.  Only wish it was larger or more squat with a larger diameter but that may not be possible given the physics of pressure cooking.  Have used it to make stew, chili, BBQ ribs (finished on BBQ), custard in individual cups using the pressure, and perfect bone broth on the slow cooker setting.  Do wish there were more recipes in the little booklet that comes with it but have found several websites with recipes."
3.0 out of 5 stars,"Better off with a full size. The quantity is very small most recipes do not make 4 servings. The cookbooks are often misspelled, it gives me concern to the quality of the recipe. Good for proofing small loaves of bread."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I am I love with my Instant Pot!  It has made my weeknights so much easier. I've had this a couple of months now and use it several times a week.  We would often resort to eating out on week nights because I didn't have time to cook a meal after work. Now I can make a roast in under an hour or risotto in 12 minutes!Food is flavorful and it is very easy to clean up. I was a little intimidated the first time I used it, but the programmable functions make it super easy to cook anything you want. My favorite program is the sauté function. It keeps all the flavors in the pot instead of sautéing in another pan and transferring the browned meat to the pressure cooker."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This pot is perfect for the person who does not care much for cooking or for the person that does not have a lot of time.  It’s very easy to use, easy to clean and certainly does what’s promised!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Pot works GREAT!  I just needed to get the next size up (8quart)Better to have more room than not enough room.  Best kitchen, cooking appliance I ever bought!I tried a couple cheaper ones (different brands).  They were ok, but I am glad I sent them backand bought the instant pot!!  Much better construction, sturdy and clean.  Feels like it will lastand very easy to use.  Well built appliance."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I use it all the time - between this and my  air fryer, why do I have a kitchen range???  The BEST function is making Yogurt .  It's also great for dried beans, mashed potatoes, rice, and my personal favorite, Parslied Potatoes.Just be careful to vent it away from wood cabinets or the steam will really destroy the finish."
3.0 out of 5 stars,"Works (with some reading and learning how to use), but bulky, and takes up a lot of space on the countertop. Kind of a huge hassle to get the lid on. Even after much practice, I still can't see where to put the lid on. This is not a ""just practice and it will work soon"" problem. The parts of the lid and base are not identified in a way that is easy to see. Not that easy to use. I've maybe used it 6 times in the last 2 years."
1.0 out of 5 stars,it heat up and gives code error .. had alot for problems with it
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love cooking, and as a double whammy so does my wife. This was purchased as a Christmas gift for her (and directly me as wells since I've been benefiting from all the deliciousness that emerges from the pot) and she absolutely loves it. 80% of all of our dinners are now cooked in our Insta Pot. It seems so daunting when you first pull it out of the box due to all of its features and buttons, but once you work through the manual its actually quite simple to use. I appreciate the weight and thickness of the stainless steel pot that goes inside. It's heavier than others I've looked at, and I also really like that its stainless and not non-stick. I have a friend who has another brand and his pot is non-stick. Both have very similar features and functions, however a lot of the recipes we've done make use of the saute feature prior to the pressure cook, and you just get a much better sear from the stainless pot. Plus, since the recipes all follow up with a pressure cook anyway, the natural science behind what happens inside prevents food from sticking to the pot anyway. Everything just wipes away with no effort. Some things to be aware of that I'm sure are probably mentioned in other reviews, the cook time in recipes does not account for the time it takes for the pot to come to pressure as well as release pressure (which is even longer if you wait for it to naturally depressurize), so that 4 minute mac and cheese can you do (which is the best darn stove top style mac and cheese you'll ever have btw) really takes closer to 20 minutes. Where you really see an impact in cooking time is when you cook items that normally would take hours. Rotisserie style chicken, pot roast, etc. all come out so tender and delicious in a fraction of the time they do if you cook it the traditional way. The only other thing I would be wary of is that I've noticed a lot of recipes we find for the cooker seem to lack a note to add salt (tons of recipes found online), especially most of the soup and stews we've found. I know its probably because salting to taste is the preference, but don't be afraid to salt your food before its cooked. And dessert? Holy cow, my wife made a cheesecake in the InstaPot that was amazing! Who knew right?  We couldn't be happier with this thing. Best investment in cooking we've made in a long time."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've been a slow-cooker gal all my life but bought this pressure cooker for my vacation cottage and made beef stew today.  Oh my gosh!  30 min to cook the beef and then added potatoes and carrots and 15 minutes later it was ready to eat.  The meat was ""cut with your fork"" tender.  This machine is easy to use - even for a first timer - just follow the directions.  This will be my ""go to"" pot for a majority of my cooking needs."
3.0 out of 5 stars,"I wish it had recipes with it.  Times recommended seem to be longer than my previous cooker.  I can’t tell in many cases if the times online include time to build pressure, even the ones on the Insta Pot site.  Struggling to get the good results I got with my old one.  I do appreciate that it came with a steamer rack."
5.0 out of 5 stars,Love love love! Buy this! Makes a great gift for a loved one or for yourself. Cooks your food so fast you dont have to spend all day thinking about and cooking dinner. I make a pot of beans from dry to ready to eat in less than an hour. So happy my sister made me buy this it is a lifesaver
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have a new kitchen staple.  I use this several times a week.  I often make crock pot meals in 30 mins or less (I dont plan well to start dinner 4 or 8 hours ahead of time).  Simplifies the yogurt making process.  I am so glad I took the dive and splurged on myself by this purchase.  So is my family.  I made a WHOLE chicken from frozen solid in 45 mins!  I do have to refer back to the booklet occasionally, because usage is not intuitive (completely different appliance from regular oven/stove top/microwave cooking).  I expected that the display could tell me the internal temp, and it does not."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Just got it yesterday, and have used it 4 times already.  Every thing has been excellent. Hard boiled eggs, bulgar wheat, a pot roast with carrots, onions and gravy, and meatballs with pasta sauce. The only downside has been a near obsession with researching recipes. I have found several websites with recipes and put shortcuts to them on my desktop. So nice to use the sauté feature to brown meat, then use the slow cook or pressure feature to cook."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I couldn't be happier with this purchase!  I've never pressure cooked before, but when this item went up on a Black Friday Deal of the Day, I thought I'd take a chance.  I'd considered them in the past, along with a rice cooker, and this item satisfied both and had incredible established reviews so I figured I couldn't go wrong.  In addition to the pressure cooker, I also purchased 

  
Great Food Fast (Best of the Best Presents) Bob Warden's Ultimate Pressure Cooker Recipes









  
  
    
   and the first recipe I tried in my Instant Pot was for a whole roast chicken.  I was nervous & skeptical that 25 minute cook time for a 4 pound bird was too good to be true, but I stuck to the recipe & cooker instructions and the end result was so much better than I could ever have expected. The most delicious, fully-cooked, perfectly tender, falling off the bone chicken that couldn't have been easier to prepare. I can't wait to see what else I can make in this thing!  I would highly recommend purchasing Bob Warden's cookbook in addition to this Instant Pot if you are a first timer like myself.  Many great recipes & instructions to help get you started with pressure cooking!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,Well good thing this had styrophome inside around the whole thing because it looks like it had a rough ride but the product looks great havent used it yet but definitely cant wait to use it. I will update when I use it
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is the most versatile appliance I have in my kitchen.  I can throw things into the pot, and walk away!  When I return there is an amazing meal ready to go.  I was particularly impressed with its ability to produce pureed pea soup, a favorite in our house for winter meals."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Do yourself a favor and just add it to the cart and buy it! Absolutely LOVE my instant pot! You can use it for everything and its so easy to use. Got mine for Christmas and have used it everyday! It makes dinner, lunch and even breakfast so much faster. I find myself meal prepping too! LOVE LOVE LOVE"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I won't repeat everyone else who has raved about this little appliance, but I didn't want to skip my 5 star review either.  There is a learning curve, but it's a short one.  You can't really over cook meats, and if you under cook them, just put then back in for a bit.  I did make mushy potatoes, but only because I extended the time out of habit of cooking much longer.  A beef roast is like a chunk of heaven.Don't be afraid to try this.  There's nothing dangerous like the old school PC's.  Just total freedom from watching the oven and no water logged crock pot food.  Just awesome!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"LOVE this pressure cooker, I got it mainly for cooking rice and pasta as I always hated how long it took to bring the water to boil for the pasta and I prefer brown rice which takes forever on the stove. BUT  have used it for many other things also. My family loved the yogurt I made with it.I love the fact you can throw a meal together last minute (I'm so bad about planing ahead) The 8 quart is soooo worth the extra $$ over the 6 quart, Only thing is I wish it had a custom programming option like the Ultra does which allows for Sous-vide cooking.(or wish the Ultra had an 8 quart version)"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Everything they say is true. This thing rocks. One tip, though: As you are loading the food into the instant pot, put it on ""sauté"" mode, so it can start heating up. If you start the pressure cooker with cold or room temperature food in it, it can take FOREVER to start cooking. I wait for it to start simmering in sauté mode before starting the pressure cooker, and the sauté mode heats up very fast. It's usually coming to a boil by the time I'm ready to turn on the pressure cooker, so it's no trouble. I love this thing!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Working great so far. Really easy to use once you get the hang of it. Love that you can saute right in the pot before pressure cooking. So much easier than the crockpot and so much quicker. I've made stews, roasts, and corned beef so far. It does also have a slow cooker setting. The pot is really roomy.  Most of all, I love that you can easily release the steam once it's done. You had to ""wait"" for quite a while for our old one to de-pressurize and it was very difficult to force it. This way I can cook the meat first. Then, I would add the veggies for about 10 additional minutes. I think next time I might go for only 5 minutes. I like my veggies on the firm side. A really great portable cooking appliance to have in the kitchen!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,I jumped on the instant pot bandwagon not sure if I would like it but I love it!! Last night we got home late & I had chili ready in 30 min! I've done corn on the cob in 3 min & made gumbo in it in about 45 min for the rice & the gumbo! I cooked the rice (it makes excellent rice btw) while I chopped the veggies for the gumbo & took out the rice & then made the gumbo in it. I'd highly recommend the silicon hand grips for it & the stainless steel stackable pots to go in it to cook 2 things at once or to reheat 2 things. You won't regret it if you buy one!
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great value! I wanted an air fryer but there was always a negative review saying they didnt work. I trust InstantPot. It’s easy to use, the food gets fried and is crunchy on the outside- soft on the inside. It’s so easy to clean. I’m so happy I bought one for my daughter."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought the Instant pot for my wife for Christmas. She laughed when she got it because I do all of the cooking and she said I bought it for myself, LOL. However, she got excited about all the different things you could make and recipes. We have used it for Stews, Chill, Chicken, rice and even made a cake.It make the best rice, really fast. I've boiled/streamed  rice before for an hour in a regular pot, with the instant pot its do in 20 minutes and is always perfect.Looking forward to trying to make yogurt, everyone says it makes awesome yogurt."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I use my instant pop ALL THE TIME!  I use it for meat mostly.  I use to cook chicken thighs and legs in the crock pot, taking up to 8 hours to get it fall apart tender.  I use my instant pot and it's done in a hour!  The chicken falls off the bone and tastes wonderful.  I cooked a 6.5 lb pork roast, from frozen (nope didn't brown it), it took roughly 2 hours, It came out of the instant pot in pieces it was so tender and the flavor was amazing!  There have been several times when I wished I had two, so I could cook two different meals at once!  I would recommend this to anyone.  It's easy to use, and cleans up pretty easily!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I use this product almost every day.  And I have made some mistakes and burned one item and the pot let me know that it was burning, turned itself off but the miracle was I could still clean it lickity split.  I can't say enough good things about this product."
5.0 out of 5 stars,Love that I can sauté then change to pressure cook in one pot!  Cooks chicken and veggies perfectly.  It does take several minutes to come to pressure but still nicer than cooking on the stove where you need to keep watch.  Also the plastic ring does have an odor (of spices used to cook with) but you can store in a zip lock once fully dry to keep the smell at bay.  The  stainless steel pot can be placed in the dish washer but I do not put any of the other pieces and just hand wash the lid and ring.  This is my absolute favorite appliance to cook with!  And lots of great recipes on skinnytaste.com (LOVE GINA!)
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I absolutely love this kitchen gadget!  Beets cook quite well in it.  No.  I do not just cook beets in it either.  I have made hummus from black beans or chickpeas/garbanzo beans, soups, and other fun things.  I cannot decide if I need to get another pot liner or a whole new device since there are times that I would like to make more than one item with less time between them.  Aw decisions!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is perfect for those times when I am cooking for just myself. I have a large 6 qt also. But, when my husband passed away I bought this mini. The only thing I don’t like is the lack of accessories for the smaller size. But, I still have my large one, so I feel that I have a lot of versatility."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought this for my mom as a gift after using mine for over a year and loving it. I use it to cook almost everything. This is a great must-have pot for those of you who do not have the luxury of time to cook. There are also tons of cookbooks and recipes out there for Instant Pot. Most importantly, now I can cook brown rice, and they consistently come out perfect by just following the directions provided in the little cookbook that comes with it."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I totally love this appliance.  The instruction manuel leaves a lot to be desired.  Pressure cooking isn't something that most people were raised with, it's not ingrained like baking or stove top cooking.  There's definately a learning curve  Fortunately, there's a hugh group on social media to help you along the way.  I read for weeks before getting my pot.  I've made about 10 meals in 2 weeks.  Everything has been delicious.Also...if you're on the fence about a 6qt or 8qt, I was concerned too.  I have a family of 7 so I went with the 8qt.  This makes sure there's enough room when doing larger meals.  Depending on what your're cooking, you cannot just fill up the pot to the max fill line.  Foods like pasta really expand!  Plus we have leftovers."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I really liked instant pot. I am rarely using my regular stove for cooking, I cook almost all my food in instant pot. Even Indian dishes can be made very easily. I use delay start feature for my morning breakfast. And instant pot is very easy to clean also. You also get alarm if food is burning."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"We've just hit our busy sports season. Having a full time job and 4 kids, I needed an easy way to make meals instead of having take out. While I love my crockpot, I often don't have time in the morning to start it and I can't start it after work because the food won't have enough time to cook. This was suggested by a friend of mine and it's awesome! Cooks things so quickly! I was really nervous about a pressure cooker because of the horror stories I've heard. The lid doesn't ""click"" into place it just kind of slides into place so I was SUPER nervous that the lid was going blow off at some point. But it didn't! Set the timer and forget it! It beeps when it's done and switches over to warm. Maybe the best purchase I've made in a long time!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I was very skeptical of pressure cookers as I had always heard the stories of their pressure building up and their disasters. This took a lot of the questions out of pressure cooking. I love that you can saute/sear your meat and pressure or slow cook in the same container. I find that we use our Instapot two to three times a week. I make everything from rice and quinoa to stew to bone broth. Only had one instance where a meal didnt turn out, and that was with pasta noodles..."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"First meal I made (Potatoes & BBQ chicken) was delicious!!!  The meat seemed to get infused with the BBQ and spices and I loved that!  Second meal was a roast & potatoes and took like 45 minutes total time!!  I was really worried it wouldn't be tender, but it was perfect!!!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I literally use this thing so much my husband just told me last night, “You rely on that thing don’t you” and we both laughed. It makes life so much easier! And the recipe book that comes with it has some great stuff and an easy to understand “cheat sheet” as I call it."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"My sister in law & my step son raved about theirs when I was visiting earlier in the month. So when it was on Prime Day, I snapped it up. So far I've only made a big batch of Greek yogurt in it. But if that's all I ever use it for is to make yogurt, I'd be happy. But I'm looking forward to trying so many things made in it."
5.0 out of 5 stars,Love love love it!! I had a huge roast and it still cooker in 1 hour and shredded soo easily. Still trying to figure out the best way to clean the outter pot with all the nooks and crannies by the lid. Any ideas? My mom bought it for my birthday and is now asking for it for mother's day because she sees how much better it is than her other pressure cooker!
4.0 out of 5 stars,Love my instant pot!! Works great!! Takes a little bit of time to figure out how to work it aka read the instructions or have someone who has one show you how to use it.  But once you figure out the general settings you can adapt and use it easily. Makes cooking many things much faster and very tasty and satisfying meals. Even though it's faster it's still does take time as you have to give it time to get up to pressure and then release. Only real complaint is that the lid is not easy to clean well nor is the ring around where the pot goes in. Otherwise love it
4.0 out of 5 stars,"So far, and I have only used this pot three times, I love it. I made ribs, chickpeas for hummus and rice pudding. I like everything about it. It is fast and everything that is promised. the ribs were unbelievable and in just 30 minutes or so. I will rate this again as I use it more, but I feel that itis going to be one of the most used appliances in my kitchen. I never had made chickpeas before but did not want to use canned for hummus. they were fantastic and my hummus was so smooth and creamy. I would recommend this to anyone."
5.0 out of 5 stars,super easy to use an super time efficiant. I absolutely love it. It also has a slow cooker function so i dont have to use my slow cooker anymore. Easy to use and clean i use it everyday.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I absolutely love this Instant Pot! I can’t stop using it. I’m definitely Obsessed with using it for everything!! If you find yourself in a cooking rut this is your revival. I don’t want to toot my own horn.. but I consider myself a stellar cook, however now that I’ve been making all sorts of soups, meats, and chili in the Instant Pot I now feel like a professional chef. Don’t be shy! Give this a try. You won’t regret it."
5.0 out of 5 stars,Already have the 6qt so now I can do side dishes at the same time! Works great for smaller side portions or smaller batch of soups! Love it!!!!
3.0 out of 5 stars,"Ok so everything is as described and it works great. BUT there's a catch (as always, with almost everything) ... this thing sucks electricity like a b****! My electricity bill nearly tripled from using this on a daily basis for cooking one meal a day. That's just ridiculous! that's why I'm giving it 3 stars, no other complaints."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have been using this about two weeks and it is nothing short of a miracle.  I was calling it my magic time machine without even realizing it until my grandchildren asked me how the magic really works.  I didn't have a good answer, but everyone loves that I pull frozen meat out at 4pm and we have a delicious meal by 5.  Trying new recipes too.  Bought the 8 qt and I am feeding an extended family of TWELVE for the next few months with enough to go around.  My 22 year old college son wants me to buy him one for his place too!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,Really enjoy using this and felt safe buying it on Amazon. It’s a whole new world! This one can take the air fryer attachment too. Takes a little getting used to—I recommend hoping some online groups for helpful tips and recipes.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Two years ago I bought the 6Q Instant Pot on a whim via the Black Friday sale here on Amazon.  I heard a lot of hype and figured at $50 it was a decent gamble.  The instant pot is my favorite kitchen gadget next to my microplane and citrus reamer!  A few uses in, however, I really wished I had purchase the 8Q version instead--though 6Q certainly met most of my needs.  Two years in, my 6Q started to have some sealing issues and instead of figuring it out, I took it as a sign (ha ha) that it was the right time for 8Q and I LOVE IT!  We're just a family of 3, but I really am enjoying the extra space and the ability to change the pressure and sauté levels.  I'm often the kind of person that doesn't really think of dinner until 3pm.  The instant pot sure helps a procrastinator out!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,Best thing I’ve ever bought! I use it constantly and it’s wonderfully fast! Producing great meals
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Just received this product. Finally, a pressure cooker I feel comfortable enough to use. Now my dried beans are cooked to the texture of my Mom's beans. Wow, what a difference. I have also sauteed and pressure cooked taco meat  - full of flavor and eggs with perfectly yellow yolks. Cooking chicken today. Looking forward to more well-cooked home meals. Thank you, Instant Pot."
2.0 out of 5 stars,"I do all right with technology, but this was too much for me.  Cooking is a rather constant task.  I don't need the frustration associated with this.  After making one thing, I decided to donate it to the resale shop, which gives its funds to the senior living place in my village.  I bought a 7 quart crock pot for less than 20 dollars.  I'm so happy with it."
5.0 out of 5 stars,It’s amazing all the different foods you can cook in the Insta Pot. I’ve been putting off buying this pot as I had the traditional pressure cooker that continued leaking steam and it finally went straight into the trash. I waited much too long but I’m so glad I finally made this purchase and I’m so happy I did.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm pretty sure I could throw a tennis shoe in this thing and cook it into shreds.  Meets and veggies taste much better, though.If you're in the market for a pressure cooker, buy this.  If you're not in the market for a pressure cooker, research them and figure out that you should be in the market for a pressure cooker, and then buy this.  All other electric pressure cookers on the market suck compared to this one, because this is the only one that actually has a stainless steel pot.  The others all have a cheap chinese ""non stick"" pot."
4.0 out of 5 stars,I still have one of 60+ years old stove top pressure cookers. I would say that they are pretty similar in comparison. I just can’t imagine someone who doesn’t have experience with a pressure cooker being able to use this thing without wrecking every meal. 😂
5.0 out of 5 stars,Very easy to use.  Having a hard time closing the lid.  Cannot believe how amazing the food comes out.  Best part every thing but the base goes in the dish washer.  I love my instant pot.  My ninja slow cooker is do jealous.
5.0 out of 5 stars,I gifted this to my girlfriend because she had one that was so big you would end up having to much food.. down sized her a little but up graded her with the technology of this one.. she likes it and we save more food..
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is that game changing appliance that is a must-have for the kitchen. I have not even touched the surface yet, having only prepared a couple of chuck roasts as well as pork for pulled pork. Make sure you understand the basics of the cooking process as well as the cool-down phase and you’ll be confident to go. This thing will save you lots of time and effort."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is the greatest kitchen appliance.  Put the food in, press a few buttons and walk away until it's done.  I've made a roast with the pressure cooker function (which is so much easier than a regular pressure cooker), pork roast with the slow cooker function, and just did steel cut oats, which turned out perfectly in just a few minutes and are time-consuming and not worth the effort on the stove.  The Instant Pot is very sturdy and looks like it should last forever.  It's pretty big and heavy but worth the space on my counter since it's so versatile.  The stainless steel pot is very sturdy but easy to take out and clean up.  The Instant Pot is more expensive than a slow cooker or pressure cooker but well worth the money."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"Great product, gave it five stars due to the continuous beeping while opening lid to turn food, and the basket gets a grip on it after a while, takes a fsir bit of elbow grease to get off but overall great product"
1.0 out of 5 stars,"Purchased my instant pot one month ago from Amazon. The instant pot would not get to pressure after going through troubleshooting techniques and working with Instant Pot customer support. In addition, the crock pot function would not cook my food (owned and used crock pot in past and same recipes followed). Instant Pot will not exchange/refund money for defective appliance, and I am outside one month window with Amazon. Although this may be an isolated incident, I would be concerned that this product cannot peform all the functions it portrays to do."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"We recommend this Instant pot to everyone now, we are so in love with ours! There is nothing we've put in there that we've been dissatisfied with and it has enhanced greatly our everyday ordinary foods, especially oats-oh my. We eat a largely plant-based, grain free, dairy free, meat free diet....so a lot of rice, lentils, legumes, and vegetables. I feel the retention of the nutrients is so much higher cooked this way and I'm not certain how I lived until the age of 38 without this! Get one, give one as a gift...you will be pleased!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"we love our IP so much, we even got one for our daughter. They sure are handy, albeit a little large to store in our RV. But it's worth having for the versatility of meals that can be made...love one pot spaghetti and how well it does hard boiled eggs, beef stew, etc....One of those seemingly fad products that's actually worth having"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Very easy to use, very versatile. The first time I used it to make black beans, and they were cooked perfectly. I also downloaded the app and got so many awesome recipes! I do not know why I did not purchase this before!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This thing deserves 100 stars. Over the years I have probably bought 10,000 dollars worth of merchandise from Amazon.  This Instant Pot stands high above everything else in terms of my customer satisfaction, there is no doubt it is the best thing I have ever purchased on Amazon.I want this thing in my casket with me when I go, I'm that attached."
1.0 out of 5 stars,"The pot worked for about 6 months, then, alas, last weekend I got the dreaded C 6 kiss of death error code. Contacted customer support via email, as well as via opening a support ticket through their website, but after 4 days of waiting I have received just one generic message that they would get back with me as soon as possible. Sadly, they have a great product, but now after 6 months it is useless."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"found this on ""were the rusos"" YouTube channel for RV'ers.  used this a few times, saves a lot of appliances cluttering the counter tops.,  cooks quickly and very cool product.  wish it browned though..  but don't ding the product for that."
4.0 out of 5 stars,This little Instant Pot is fun to use.  I like the size of it for a one person family.  I don't like the thick round cord that actually has to be plugged into the IP before using.  My 6 quart stays attached and is smaller and more flexible. It was a disappointment to see a brand new model with more settings come out just after I purchased this.  The price was good as it was marked down for whatever reason and arrived in NEW condition.
1.0 out of 5 stars,Waiting for my refund. Item was sent 5 days ago. Item was defective
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Instant Pot has changed my life ... We had a major issue with a gas leak in my apartment building, and while repairs are being done the gas has been shut off for over 2 months with no end in sight. I am so happy I purchased an Instant Pot. I do also have a high quality electric burner, but I have been making soup and stew and rice in this, and imagine I will continue using it long after I have my stove back. It makes amazing food in way less time than a slow cooker. Highly recommend!!"
3.0 out of 5 stars,All working perfect. It is really life saver. Everyone should have 2 in their kitchen. I only have problem with stain under the pot. Cleaning the inside pot is easy but it always has stains. That's way I gave lower rate. Does anyone else has some problem or is it safe to use like that?
5.0 out of 5 stars,I had another brand that had a nonstick coating I noticed was starting to degrade. Oh heck no. Bought this for the stainless steal insert. But I will say this cooks faster than my old one and is quieter. Easy to clean and you don’t have to worry about ingesting non stick coating in your meal.
4.0 out of 5 stars,Was highly sceptical about this when it came out. A year into using this it I ended up buying 2 more of these . The only reason I give it a 4 instead of 5 is because the food does seem to stick to the stainless steel vessel more on one side as compared to other when using saute mode. Makes me wonder if its uneven cooking.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I decided to get this as a treat myself for Christmas. Six months later, this Instant Pot is going strong. Easy to use, makes AMAZING ribs in next to no time, I use this at least twice a week. Perfect for those lazy days."
2.0 out of 5 stars,"When the product worked it was good. Then it started to malfunction. The steam vent would not seal. I reached out to amazon and amazon turn me back to IP and IP has been very unresponsive, calls not answered. When I went back to Amazon I was referred to a ‘pissed customer’ forum. The issue remains unresolved."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"My second one! My first one fell out of my van and the bottom was badly damaged. Since it is a pressure cooker, we did not want to see it blow up in our faces so we discarded it. Got the larger one this time ( 6 liters) which fits bigger cuts of meat and more soup/stew. We have done hard-cooked eggs, rice, yogurt, steel cut oats (12 minutes after pressure) winter squash (6 minutes after pressure) and beef and pork. Great that its liner is stainless steel."
5.0 out of 5 stars,Was nervous about using a pressure cooker because of all the horror stories you hear about them. This one is great!!! Almost impossible to mess anything up using it. Cooks food fast so that you could work all day and still get a pot roast and veggies on the table at a decent time.  You can do so many different items with the pre programmed controls that it is easy to make any kind of meat or soup or chili etc. Even has a button for making yogurt! Can not say enough good things about the Instant Pot!
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I am so glad I purchased this for myself as an early Christmas present. I cook dinner 6 nights a week and I easily use it twice a week. I've never owned a pressure cooker before, but I was in the market for a slow cooker, so I felt this was a solid purchase to make. We've cooked a variety of items in the pressure cooker, such as corned beef, short ribs, pork ribs, chili, bone broth, all of which came out wonderful (I highly recommend making short ribs). It was so nice to be able to brown my meats in the same pan that I use for the pressure/slow cooker. The slow cooker works great; I've never owned a slow cooker that had a timer that not only counts down and will switch to warm when done, but it'll also tell me how long it's been keeping the food warm inside. My husband uses it all the time to make rice (brown and jasmine). The only function we haven't gotten around to using in the 6 months we've owned it is the yogurt function, mostly because I've never made my own yogurt and I mostly use the Instant Pot for dinner. The vessel is easy to clean and guests always inquire about it as it sits on my counter top (it stands fairly tall imo).  The photo attached is what's in the slow cooker right now - a 4lb bone-in portion of pork shoulder."
5.0 out of 5 stars,This lid is great! Turned my existing Instant Pot into an air fryer Rather than having to buy another bulky kitchen appliance. Works great and I use it more frequently than the original Instant Pot lid.
5.0 out of 5 stars,We love our instant pot!  It really has helped us to not eat out as much. So many meals are so much easier!  I especially love the meals where I can just dump everything and turn it on. What a timesaver!  No standing at the stove or stirring. I bought it for my husband's birthday and he has not stopped raving about it to everyone he sees.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love it! Easy healthy meals that are so quick.  Use a long object to release the steam, not your hand. It smells so delicious that you will forget, and it will hurt....so don’t do it! I’d recommend adding on a clear lid for after it’s done and a steam diverter if you have to cook under cabinets.  It’s awesome despite a few minor steam burns."
5.0 out of 5 stars,I love this thing. I’ve used it to make a wide range of dishes but my favorite is pulled pork. It takes a 13 hour cook down to 3 for those days I’m not ready to put in the tome on the grill. I just tried making cheesecake and it turned out great.

   I always wanted a pressure cooker however I was skeptical to get an electric one!! But boy was I stupid lol. This thing is literally the best, it saves time! Lots of time! Since I’ve had it, I’ve made Zuppa Toscana and BBQ Ribs!!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Every once in a while there comes a product that works better than advertised - and this one does it.  No sense in adding anything else to all the glowing reviews.  The only choice you really have to make is which size to get.  We got a 6 quart for our family and the 8 quart for another family member.  Both are superb!  Every once in a while they are on sale, but you won't waste your money by not waiting."
1.0 out of 5 stars,"I have used it for sautéing/searing and pressure cooking roasts. Outstanding!!! Really am impressed. I love an all day crockpot dinner but quick... this is it. Then on 3d use, pressure valve would not seal. Inoperable."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"This electric pressure cooker is amazingly quiet, easy to clean and feels safer than a traditional pressure cooker. It is easier to use than any other pressure cooker, too, and it saves stove space.I gave it to my daughter who makes bone broth a lot. She loves this pot for slow cooking, but never managed to make bone broth to her liking. She went back to her old pressure cooker just for the bone broth. But otherwise this product works beautifully for making many dishes. It's a great addition to any kitchen."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I debated whether to order the Instant Pot for about 6 months. I didn't think I would get much use out of it, that's why the stall in ordering. Without a doubt this is the best piece of equipment in my kitchen, and I have many kitchen appliances. I used it two days after receiving it. I made pork chops with onions and garlic, turned out delicious. I was never afraid of using it...I've read on IP sites that some people have owned their IP for over a year and haven't even taken it out of the box for fear it'll explode. People...take it out of the box and start using it! You can thank me later for the encouragement."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"If you are reading this, you obviously do not own one. For this price...why the F not? Make sure to save your booklets and to sign up on the FB cult page. This is a major game changer. Then look for the extra accessories on sale either Walmart or on Amazon. Welcome to the Cult!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Got this for my wife for Christmas.  She loves it. At first she was nervous because it seems so difficult and different to use, but after 2 or 3 dinners she is like a pro. Our favorite thing is chicken and skettie!! It looks hard to use, but with the manual and experience it's  not. Once you get a feel for it, the options are endless!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"What can’t you do in an InstaPot?  Is easy to clean and doesn’t really bulk up the counter top (can be stored when cool).  There is a learning curve to the newbies, but there is so much info on the net on how to use that is helpful."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I wasn't sure if I wanted to join the Instapot party, but I'm glad I did. It's so easy to use and makes dinners in a flash. It's fun trying new recipes. :)"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"A life saver! I was so exhausted after work, that I just didn’t want to cook. We ended up getting take out several times a week and we finally decided it was time to change that. So we got the Instant Pot and have been able to eat healthier l, quicker. Most recipes are “set it and forget it” with minimal prep work. It can be a little scary to use if you’ve never used a pressure cooker before, but it has been such a help for weight loss and eating better!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Once you get this, you won't know how you lived without it. I originally purchased this to make bone broth more quickly (from around 2 days to 4 hours when using the pressure cooker.) I still use it all the time to make bone broths (great for so many things: great skin- cellulite, wrinkles, psoriasis, bone health, and overall gut health) and I've recently started getting more creative and have been using it to make soups, stews, and cook ridiculously tender meat in literally a fraction of the time it used to take. Great buy."
3.0 out of 5 stars,"The product was a gift and arrived without the condensation container. I advised the recipient to reach out to the manufacturer and I will update this review based on the result. I’m hoping they come through, as I’ve purchased several for gifts, because I love my instant pot."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Just buy this!  I have was able to get rid of three devices with this one product!  I've owned this now for nearly two months and I use it 2-3 times a week!  I just love the reduced cooking time.  Today I completely forgot to make a potluck meal for the office.  I was able to cook rice in the office in 8 minutes (after coming up to pressure) and 15 minutes for Japanese Curry.  When my son goes to college, he'll be getting an instant pot!"
2.0 out of 5 stars,"We loved the Instant Pot and used it occasionally (maybe once a month).  My wife used it mainly for cooking rice.Last week using the Pot she was shocked while stirring rice with a metal spoon.  Subsequently, we discovered that it would not power up.  The 110 circuit checked out OK so the fault is with the Instant Pot.  Online, I discovered that a lot of these units have a faulty connection that fails over time.  Even though he pot is out of warranty, I am reviewing this because the shock really freaked my wife.  Forewarned is forearmed."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I read the manual and thought it sounded complicated to use. But once I started using it, I realized it was easy and very convenient.  I have been using it every day now.  If you have never used a pressure cooker before, it might take you a little longer to get comfortable with using it but do not give up as it is totally worth while once you master it.  It will not blow up on you, so don't worry!  I made turkey soup with the bones from my Thanksgiving turkey and could not believe the flavor it had.  I am thrilled to have this pot and I look forward to cooking all kinds of dishes now."
1.0 out of 5 stars,It arrived dented in the box! The packaging was fine - no signs of any issues. This tells me it was damaged at the factory when placed in the box. Very disappointed in the quality.
1.0 out of 5 stars,"The pot was lopsided , so I returned it."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Slow to the InstantPot party but treated myself to one as a birthday present.  It lives on the counter as I now use it four to five times a week.  Need a soup?  InstantPot.  Cook up some beets? InstantPot. Spaghetti Sauce?  InstantPot.  Was worried that this might be too small for many choices, but three quarts makes a fairly good sized dish for a small household that likes having leftovers."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Instant pot!!!! arrived quickly, packaged well.  This pot is such a time saver! Couldn't be happier. Use this pot at least 3 times a week. So many easy to use healthy recipes with simple ingredients. Not your mother's pressure cooker. Safe and fun to use. hard boil eggs, soups, stews, cheesecakes, steam veggies, make yogurt etc.... even made vanilla extract for Christmas gifts ...So easy to clean and a joy to look forward to cooking in my Instant pot when time is short.  Dinner in as little as 30 minutes. LOVE this purchase!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Versatile and will do just about everything. Will even re-heat food using steam or pressure or even cook packaged stuff. Microwaves are cool but I use this, the oven or cast iron, food tastes way better as such."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love this. I have not tried every feature yet, but so far tried most and made about a dozen meals in it. My husband LOVES it as well. Fast and easy to use pressure cooking. Saute right in this pot then set to slow cook or pressure cook. Getting ready to make some chicken curry right now. Order the glass lid is you plan on using it as a slow cooker. I like to see how the meal is cooking throughout the day without always having to lift the lid."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love this little guy. It is perfect for small dinners or small sides. It isn't large enough to feed a large family so I did buy a larger instant pot for bigger meals, but I still use this one the most for now. My favorite thing to cook is roast because it is the more tender when cooked in the instant pot."
1.0 out of 5 stars,"BIG disappointment. I have used this Instant Pot infrequently since I bought it. It failed in 3 years of limited use. I went through the customer service department and they offer no repairs, only 20% off list price for a new pot. It seems the control panel failed. Some buttons worked and others did not. The saute button and off button no longer work. For an expensive appliance that should work for years, this appears to be poorly designed."
2.0 out of 5 stars,"I didn’t like the instapot for a few reasons. 1) I’ve been using a regular pressure and you have to relearn every recipe with this. 2) after cooking each time the smell never goes even with vinegar, this is what I could not stand the most. 3) The size instapot recommends for household is off IMO. 6 quart was too huge for our family of 4 and we should’ve gone down in size.  Overall, I will be returning because of the smell and that it isn’t different than a regular pressure cooker except you can set a timer and forget it."
3.0 out of 5 stars,We have it. We use it oh once a week probably. The cooking time is just that the time it actually cooks at pressure. The cooking time does not include pressuring up time and pressuring down time. Time to check the food to see if it's done. We now double the time it says to cook to include the other time.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"My family has loved everything that I have cooked so far in this thing.  I can't go wrong apparently.I have made pho, chicken n dumplings, pasta e fagioli, chana masala, mujadarra, pork bbq, carnitas, and other things I can't even remember now.  All to perfection for my family apparently."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love how quickly you can make tender meat (roasts & stews). We haven't had great results with rice or pastas... we like ours al dente & the instant pot makes it a little too soggy for our liking. I've also had trouble finding a bundt pan that fits. Although multiples reviews have said they used a full-size, I've tried at least 3 different brands & none of them fit."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"We are converts to pressure cooking with this easy to use and well supported product (blogs from other users). We just keep on finding new recipes and ways to use it and I can see people could live without an oven/range with one of these.  And you can't get many practical appliances these days at the price these units sell at.  The 6 quart model is more that sufficient for my wife and I that cook batches to provide multiple meals. Our rice cooker is also now obsolete, as this also makes great rice.  I think it may come with us on camping road trips as well."
5.0 out of 5 stars,Love this!  One of the most used items in my kitchen!
5.0 out of 5 stars,"When I first got this pot, it sat for a long, long time without being used.  Unfortunately, the instruction booklet seemed a little bit hard for me to understand.  However, after my son showed me how to use it, it has become about the only thing used in my kitchen.  It is wonderful to make tender meats that can be pureed for someone who is not able to chew well.  Can't do without it now."
5.0 out of 5 stars,Can use it like the old o rd just much safer. It does have some settings that’s a little hard to understand but once you use it a couple times it works great. Will reduce your cook time and makes tough meat tender quick.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"GOD please the minds who created this device and the pressure cooking concept lol !!This product has been such a convenience and relief to my daily working mom lifestyle! They children have loved every single dish I have prepared, even the veggies! Cooking boiled eggs and meats has been glorious. You can’t really over cooks meats,they just become more tender. Veggies on the other hand make take a bit more effort with finding the perfect cooking times. They can get soggy in no time."
5.0 out of 5 stars,This fryer lid is legit. It will make your tator tots and wings crispy. It's a bit awkward to use but comes with a trivet to set the hot lid on. Definitely recommend this if you like fried food but don't like housing gallons of oil for it.
1.0 out of 5 stars,Bought it for the slow cooker. Slow cooker option does not work. I tried to cook a 1 pound pork tenderloin. 9 hours later on high. Was not even a third of the way cooked. The potatoes hadn't even started to cook. Needed to switch to preasure cook after 10 hours of cooking.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I can't say enough good things about the IP. I waited almost two years before getting one because I was afraid it would be just another appliance using up drawer space. Wrong!  It has become my preferred method of cooking. Everything is so fast and easy. When I think about what I want to cook for dinner now, my first thought is what can I cook in the IP. My only regret is that I waited so long to buy it."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought this and it took me 9 months to use it.  I was nervous, but once I did I was so happy I had it.  I've cooked one pot meals, a roast chicken, and browned meat.  I needed a new slow cooker but then realized I can just use my Instant Pot.  So great to have that feature as well."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"I have used this Instant Pot several times since I recently purchased it.  It is well made and somewhat easy to use.  However, I did find the instruction booklet overly full of verbiage and somewhat difficult to follow. The UTube videos were much more helpful than the instruction manual.  Finally I just dove in with cooking chickpeas and the results were amazing. Perfectly cooked in forty minutes.  Prior to the pressure cooker I had used my slow cooker for chickpeas and just about everything else,  Using this pressure cooker was an eye opener.  The results were quick and perfect. It has plenty of friendly safety features, very logical control panel, and easy to clean.  Place to hold lid upwards is a nice feature. The stainless steel bowl is easy to clean. I noticed the sides do not get hot but I would say just warm.  The construction is very good. The lid fits securely  onto the pot. This pressure cooker can also be used as a slow cooker!  I won't be using my trusty slow cooker anymore.  Will keep it in storage though, just in case"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This was a gift for somebody else but when I got it I was really impressed at the Quality and when I got a thank-you letter back from the person I gifted it to they said that they really liked it, it did ship quick and came in two boxes so was packed very well."
5.0 out of 5 stars,My wife was up for the challenge to find some different ways to quickly prepare some meals.It has not disappointed us so far.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought this as a gift for someone else, but it looked great to me, much nicer quality than the one's I have seen at big box store.  stainless steel cook pot a plus.  on the heavy side, I think around 15 lbs, so this may be a factor for some.  came with everything you need to get started.  I personally use a stovetop jiggler top stainless steel pressure cooker, but if I had big family to cook for would get one of these for myself!!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Really great product, but there's a trick that I found out about this product for those of you who are having trouble with the pressure release valve. When you are about to put on the lid, you should always make sure the nob that is easily maneuvered, which seals the pressure in, is faced towards the ""venting"" illustration,  NOT ""sealed."" If this isn't done properly it could affect how your food cooks, because you need an air tight lock when the machine begins the pressure formation. Hope that helps."
1.0 out of 5 stars,This insta pot is a piece of junk. What a disaster cooking the first meal. This is really bad. Run run run. I read the manual and watched multiple videos and it was a disaster. DO NOT BUY. YOU WILL BE SORRY! I’m just past the 30 day period because I was out of state. Now I can’t return it. I give this ZERO stars.
5.0 out of 5 stars,It’s a must have in a kitchen if you don’t want to spend hours prepping meals for the week.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This product didn't just meet my expectations, but exceeded them above and beyond. I haven't seen a single bad review and probably will never see. Using the instant pot made me look into new recipes and foods I never tried before. It made me dare more and just 'throw' random things into the pot knowing that something great is going to come out. The prep time has been cut significantly and you don't have to wait and watch the food cooking (you can't see anything anyways since it is locked and sealed haha), and while the pot is doing its job and can enjoy other activities or just relax. Thank you Instant pot for a great creation and a revolutionary product."
5.0 out of 5 stars,I hemmed and hard about purchasing an instant pot. I’m so glad I did! These are wonderful and easy I cannot believe I even hesitated about an 8 quart because we are a family of five and we also have family over quite a bit. There are a ton of recipes online they give you specific instructions based upon what you own.
5.0 out of 5 stars,I love my instant pot I use it every day! Perfect for all kinds of recipes. There was a small learning curve trying to figure out how to operate it but weeks later there's no problem! I have cooked everything from pastas to chili. It also cleans very well.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love this device! Yes, it looks a little weird and takes up a fair amount of counter space, but it works very well. I use the pressure cooker for quick roasts and stews on short notice, and the slow cooker when I plan in advance.  Very pleased with the built in sauté functionality and the one pot cleanup! Plan to use it to make my own yogurt in the near future.  Amazon had deeply discounted the price, and I'm pleased with the product."
5.0 out of 5 stars,I was actually disappointed at first use. There is more of a learning curve to this then I thought. I suggest you watch you tube reviews before purchasing. Now that I have used this for several months I actually really like it. Amazon was slow to ship this. I had a guaranteed delivery of two business day but it took over 5. Ugh. This is plenty big for a family of four unless you always want left overs. We use this at least twice a week now.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I really love using the Instant Pot.  I already had a slow cooker.  And I've had a stove-top Presto pressure cooker for 50 years!!!  And it's still in great shape.  But I wanted an electric pressure cooker.  And I've been thinking about buying a rice cooker and a steamer for a long time.  This does it all.  I've used it many, many times and I've only had it for a little over a month!  The only feature I haven't used is to make yogurt.  And I'll try that very soon.  I am amazed at how easy it is to use and to clean up.  I especially like the saute feature.  I can brown the meats and also braise veggies, etc. before I use the slow cooker.  All the brown bits stay in the pot...gives all my dishes a wonderful flavor.  And I can thicken the gravy or sauces easily without losing any of the flavor.  It's so quiet when in use.  My stove top pressure cooker is a little noisy!  What a wonderful appliance this is!  I just might purchase some for Christmas gifts for my daughters/daughters-in-law!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love this pot so much, I do everything in it, from rice to frozen meat this thing is the best for a new mom trying to make more then just take out. whenever i tell someone i use a pressure cooker they think the meat is just over cooked and soft but NO, nononono, everything i have cooked is tender and moist. just the other day i made pork chops that were still frozen and they were the best. i have fantastic meals in less then an hr with minimum work.btw if you like Mac and Cheese, this is the best for this pothttp://dadcooksdinner.com/2013/04/pressure-cooker-macaroni-and-cheese.html/"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love everything about the insta pot, it’s very versatile I was going to buy a yogurt maker, but when I saw this, it made more sense to have a machine that can do so many more things. It makes a great deep bone broth and my yogurt turned out great and it was so easy to do. I love that the insert is stainless steel, so easy to clean and light weight."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love this Air Fryer!  It is fast and easy to use. Really easy to clean.  I have not seen a drop of anything on the Air Fryer lid.  You just have to wash your fryer basket and the Instant Pot liner. I have not found anything that sticks.  I have made BBQ Ribs, fries, and onion rings.  All were amazing!"
2.0 out of 5 stars,I just inboxed my instant pot and noticed the quick release button is broken. Haven’t even had the opportunity to use it yet?
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I am one of those people who was traumatized by an exploding pressure cooker as a child... I absolutely LOVE my instant pot. the 8qt is perfect for my needs, the labeling is clear, the directions are concise and give you a good idea of what to expect.  Im happy I can now have the convenience of a pressure cooker and not be terrified of flying metal lids.  There are so many resources for recipes and do many ways to use it to just make meal preparation easier it's a fabulous tool to have."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"It hardly seems necessary to weigh in on this fabulous appliance. However I would like to add meal diversity as another wonderful metric.So extensive was my trusty crockpot usage that the meal diversity afforded by the IP was serendipitous. Virtual time compression is possible with a crockpot by preparing say a weeks worth of a meal base such as lentils. With the IP I find myself preparing a single portion of broccoli greens, lentils, hull-less barley, and long grain brown rice in 35 minutes for lunch and hard boiled eggs and sweet potatoes for dinner.I could eat lintels and brown rice forever and never notice however the ability to diversify my super food only diet with real time compression is marvelous!"
4.0 out of 5 stars,"Seems well built, so far no problems (circuit board kept burning out) like I had with another manufacturer (Elite Platinum). Only complaint is when I make soup I can’t fill the pot as full as I could with my other electric pressure cooker, even if I fill below the line the stem vent will not pop up and seal, only reason I deducted a star."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love this!! I got if for my sister as a Christmas gift and ended up buying myself one! It cooks so fast and doesnt dry out the meats. It's simple to find recipes...I'd read the instruction manual before trying to cook, as skimming over them doesnt work, this is not a crock pot, there is a little more to it. But well worth it."
1.0 out of 5 stars,"our instant pot duo arrived missing the condensation collector, rice paddle, soup spoon and measuring cup.not appreciated.  argh."
3.0 out of 5 stars,The pot does a great job at pressure cooking but the valve on top ALWAYS gets stuck and I have to manually try to jiggle it to come up when it’s suppose to. For the money I paid it shouldn’t do that after only using it 4 times. Very disappointed!
4.0 out of 5 stars,"Two complaints. It is a bit too small for family of 4. Perfect for 1-2 people. I wish it had a couple of options for simmer, rather than one setting."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"We were able to consolidate our separate pressure cooker, slow cooker, and yoghurt maker. When our Zojirushi rice cooker dies, we'll likely use this as a rice cooker as well. Quite happy with the discounted price:value. No regrets. We use this every single day, and I can't see us putting it away in some dark place where most appliances go to hibernate."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love my instant pot.  So versatile, easy to use and clean.  Rice comes out perfect.  Chicken is so tender, hard boil eggs are perfect, steel cut oats, etc., etc.  Having so much fun trying new things..  highly recommend!!"
2.0 out of 5 stars,"We heard many great things about instant pot so we ordered it. We waited anxiously for its arrival and when it finally did we found out the knob for the pressure was extremely loose. We tried to tighten it but it’s apparent that it’s broken. We called instant pot customer service and explained that the part was broken. Instead of sending us a replacement pot, they said it’s one of most common part to be broken and only showed us on how to fix it. Unfortunately, we had to ask for a full refund from amazon."
1.0 out of 5 stars,"Poor packaging. Comes in original box, no surprise for this one. Not much protection for item. Small dent on side of box, large dent on item.  Reordered second same packaging,  no dent but no power cord.  Boxes are not sealed.  Better packaging would have allowed this gift to be tested out.  Problem was second was given as a gift and the missing cord was not noticed until they were home, hours away. Would be nice to actually provide a review."
4.0 out of 5 stars,This is good product but I nearly use it because it needs to be clean very properly
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is intimidating at first but a great buy. I have used it almost everyday since I bought it. You can cook from frozen, u can put a bunch of ingredients in the pot and let it cook for you. Love it would buy again"
5.0 out of 5 stars,I am suprised at how much I use my Instant Pot. I haven't had any problems at all and all of the recipes I've tried have been a success. I highly recommend the instant pot! I wish I would've bought it years ago!
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love my InstaPot.  Get smaller size if you want additional parts.  No accessories for this size.  Joined fb group.  Making homemade yogurt, oatmeal and get all.  So excited to do more in winter!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This  is the best kitchen equipment i got, it is very safe, easy to use, versatile, can make many  indian foods  quickly, does not need constanr watch.  I love this instapot, my cooking time is significantly reduced,  most importantly it is quite safe."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"Somewhat difficult to use, vague instructions. Once you figure out how to use it, it's great!"
3.0 out of 5 stars,"Difficult to use. Directions are unclear. Very large and wish it was easier to use. I’ve burned multiple dishes in here even though there is a burn alert function.I’ll keep it for now, but I’m weary and tired of burned dishes"
5.0 out of 5 stars,This device has literally changed out lives. Before we would eat out 3-4 times a week for dinner because of the amount of time it takes to make a good meal. Well the Instapot has changed all that and we eat more at home than ever because of the time savings. This is a must have for a busy household.
1.0 out of 5 stars,C6L error straight out of the box.  Item received defective. Please help!
1.0 out of 5 stars,I don't whether this particular piece is not good or this model is not that efficient as the other Lux model that I have. Either it burns the food or doesn't cook as effectively as my other instant pot. sent an email to product support. they suggested me to try a quick water test which worked fine. Don't know what to do. thinking about returning it and buying it from g good retail store like Walmart where the customer service is good. Here don't know whom do I need to contact.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"my wife bought this when there was a discount, then it sat there for a few months.But after we started using it, we love it and use it a few time a week.It does not really cook food 'much faster' if you compare to the regular pressure cooker.But it stands out for its convenience that you don't need to watch the store/fire."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Still a lot to learn but very happy with it.  Would definitely buy again. Just two of us. Perfect size.  Plus: great especially in summer since it doesn't heat up kitchen like oven or cooking on top of stove. Also, say goodbye to slow cooker. This does both. Hold off on accessories until you get to know it."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love my i Pot!  It WAS an permanent fixture on my countertop but I don't like clutter so I take it out when I use it which isn't a big deal.  I really like this size. It's perfect for my family of 4 and many levftovers.  Beans, Garbanzo Beans, and Rice turn out perfect!  Vegan Under Pressure is a great cookbook.  And for an easier, straight to the point cookbook - Jill McKeever's cookbooks are easy to follow and not overwhelming with a ton of recipes.  https://www.amazon.com/Good-Instant-Meals-Plant-Based-Oil-free/dp/0985124822/ref=sr_1_1?s=pet-supplies&ie=UTF8&qid=1524751374&sr=8-1&keywords=jill+mckeever"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm still new to this instant pot and pressure cooking thing and haven't made a whole lot.  I wish I would have known how long it takes to get up to pressure before purchasing, but it really isn't a big deal when my roasts, from frozen!, have come out faster and far more tender than anything I've ever made in my crockpot or oven.  It also makes doing a large batch of shredded chicken a snap."
5.0 out of 5 stars,My daughter is a Insta-pot fan and loves her 6qt so i purchased this for her and she loves it!Fries well ~Easy to clean ~Crispy air fry cooking .It's a must have if you love your insta-pot.
3.0 out of 5 stars,"I'd like this a whole lot better if it wasn't so sensitive. It sets off burn notices if you even look at it sideways. It could have been my favorite, but alas the air fryer is reliable and takes that honor."
5.0 out of 5 stars,Although a little complicated the directions were clear and a little bit sparse on thicker sauces as they tend to scotch but safety alerts prevent bad outcomes. It’s ideally suited to make a stew at 20 minutes a pound so after work cooking can make dishes which otherwise take hours a reality.
5.0 out of 5 stars,Made a braised lamb with white beans and spinach - was so easy braising the lamb chops right in the Instant Pot then adding the other ingredients to cook and reducing the time needed using the pressure cooker setting. Barely any cleanup! A win-win!! Had a little trouble initially trying to get the lid on properly and lock it but once I realized you need to line up the arrows on the pot and lid (they are difficult to see) it worked like a charm.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Bought this Gizmo five months ago.  GREAT GADGET!!!!  Buy you one!!!!  I've probably used it 15 times or so.  You can turn any grade of meat into tender succulent Joy-Joy.  Its not quite as fast as it sounds, because there is a ""warmup"" time that can mean 20 minutes of warmup before your 20 minute ""time"" begins.  Still WAY faster than any other way to cook.  My focus with it is to create delicious and enjoyable dishes that are low sugar, low salt and low carb.  Its nice to know exactly what is in your dinner.  Love this machine.  Get you one.  Very well made....get you the lid fo r the stainless steel bowl so you can put your concoction right into the fridge."
5.0 out of 5 stars,I love this appliance and use it for everything from boiled eggs to country ribs. If I could think of a shortcoming I would certainly cite it but the only way I think it could be improved is if it came with a chef who combined the ingredients and pushed the button to cook.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I was new to the IP world. No longer... I bought this 3 months ago as a christmas present for myself, it has changed my life. We are on a clean food diet. So I used to spend hours and hours cooking and prepping every day.That is down to 30 mins a day! I recommend this to anyone and everyone. Also we bought this as it has a steal insert instead of ceramic (slow cooker), as ceramic inserts in slow cookers have show to leave traces of lead in your food."
5.0 out of 5 stars,I love my instant pot! Definitely one of the best purchases I have made on Amazon. I love to use the pressure cooker setting for my chili. Making lentils is also really easy. I love coming home and having food made for me. It would be nice to not have a heart attack every time I open the vent to let the steam out. I’ll just have to get used to the palpitations. I have gotten a lot better at putting the lid on. What once seemed impossible is now actually easy.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Bought this for my college student daughter who moved off campus into an apartment.  Space was limited but she wanted a rice cooker, a Crock-Pot, and a pressure cooker, this fit the bill all in one.  She loves it and uses it more than the stove.  I am a huge fan as well of pressure cookers, been cooking meals in it for years."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"While not my most commonly used kitchen appliance, the IP has earned its place in my home. It’s great for those times when I waited to long to decide what’s for dinner, boiled eggs turn out perfect every time, and I love being able to sauté and cook in one pot. Probably don’t utilize it as much as I should, but I’m happy with it."
4.0 out of 5 stars,Trust me this product is really cool there’s a lot of cool features like how the handles hold the lid when you’re done cooking or it automatically keeps warm once it’s done cooking or the fact that your food cooks within minutes... but it’s almost so easy to use it’s complicated. You would think there’s more to it than what there is and it doesn’t really come with instructions. Also I wish it came with more of a guide of how to and to use in the pot... I had to watch YouTube videos
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my new favorite kitchen toy!  I am remodeling my kitchen right now and I was dreading the downtime I would have with no oven or stove.  I don't usually use a microwave, so I wasn't sure how I was going to eat unless I ate out almost every meal, which would be very expensive.  I've used my pressure cooker everyday and we are eating just like we normally eat when the kitchen is in working order.  I love that I can toss some chicken, some spices and a cup of broth in there with some veggies and have a complete meal in less than 20 minutes!  I recommend you purchase a cookbook specifically geared towards electric pressure cookers and start cooking.  I've even lost a little weight due to using only fresh and whole ingredients for every meal.  This machine will have a permanent place on my new counters when they are installed."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased this after recommendation from my DIL and boss. I have used pressure cookers for the past 40 years and especially like the features of these newer cookers. My purchase was an Amazon Warehouse find which made the deal sweater. Happy with the purchase, the cooker and would recommend."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"First of all, I love Instant Pot. This 3-quart model is my second Instant Pot, the first one being a 6-quart LUX model that I've used and loved for about three years. I would have given my new 3-quart model 5 stars if I hadn't cut myself on the inside of the lid, where there are some very sharp unfinished edges. I was pressing down on the gasket and sliced my thumb on one of those knife-sharp edges. Since I have another Instant Pot I could compare the lids, and discovered that the older model was fine. All the edges had been smoothed down nicely. So, I love you, Instant Pot, but I'm a little disappointed that more care wasn't taken with this otherwise terrific 3-quart Mini."
5.0 out of 5 stars,Love my instant pot. I wish I had gotten the 8 quart. Buy extra rubber rings as they absorb odors that can’t be removed.
1.0 out of 5 stars,"I live at 6500' elevation. This thing made a bottom chuck roast (in slow cook mode) almost edible, other than the tough part, in 8+ hours. Almost. Then I read many reviews and concluded that its use as a slow cooker was limited but hey! There's always the pressure cooker function. Wrong. First dish, with chicken thighs, inedible and raw at end of first cycle; doubled the cycle and it was marginally okay, that's it. Saying that ~20-25% more time will be needed for pressure cooking is a bit vague and, given the fact I doubled it (with both slow cooker and pressure cooker) to get barely edible results is NOT a good thing."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Do yourself a favor and get this instant pot. I am no cook by any mean but with this, I feel like I can go on Hells Kitchen.No but Forreals, this has been one of the best investments ever. My meal prep time is cut in half, I can create delicious meals I have never been able to do, it’s so easy that there no excuse not to use it.This was my first time using an instant pot. I don’t even know how I was living before. 10/10 would recommend!"
2.0 out of 5 stars,"Bought this a bit ago (outside of return window). I use it to cook hard boiled eggs, but it gives me completely inconsistent results. i have it set to 3 minutes, put the same number of eggs in the same position, same amount of water and yet one time it will be cooked properly and the next it will be totally undercooked. When it is undercooked, it seems to be because it isnt getting to pressure... (but the valve is up, so it obviously thinks it is under pressure). It is the difference between a 40 second quick release and a 5 second quick release."
2.0 out of 5 stars,I’m just not happy with my instant pot cooker. It either  over cooks or under cooks.  It is hard to get the hang of. It takes up a lot of room and just is not that convenient. By the time it pressurizes and cooks you really haven’t saved yourself anytime.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Excellent purchase! I enjoy it! You can sauté in it, brown meat before pressure cooking, it replaces my rice cooker. I’ve made Spahetti Squash perfectly cooked in 8 minutes, cooked several roasts in 80-90 minutes, make beans without soaking them first, rice.. I’ve got a list of things to still try: rotisserie style chicken, pork ribs, yogurt and so much more. If I’m cooking almost every night, then it stays on the counter as an counter appliance, but easily stores if it is used less than a couple times a month. I’ve used so many tips from online Recipe Blogs, this is a widely used product. I’m considering purchasing 1 smaller sized one too!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,One of the best things we bought from Amazon.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love my IP! I'm a newbie at PC and a little overwhelmed and intimidated and have not used all of its functions yet but there are some functions and recipies I use on a regular basis. I love how quick it cooks foods, that it doesn't stink up the house as some foods would if cooked on the stove, it doesn't heat up the kitchen like an oven would, and doesn't consume electricity like the stove or oven. Did I mention how quick it cooks?? ❤❤😍😎🙌👅"
5.0 out of 5 stars,I bought this as a gift for my boyfriend. He has made so many things. It's easy and clean up is a breeze.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This thing is fantastic.  I cook a LOT and this pot works as described!  The saute works great (contrary to what Consumer Report says) as does the pressure cooker.  The high quality, stainless steel inner cooking pot cleans easily and quickly.  Easy to use, too.  Will make your cooking easier and WAY faster.  Buy the largest one you can afford."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Thank God they came out with the air frying lid. Now you do not have to waste your money on the ninja foodie lol. Perfect cooking every time, the fact that it works with the instapot you already have is awesome. I purchased the ninja foodie As I desired both functions very much so. Within the 90 days that I purchased it I found this lid. It has revolutionized the way we cook in the kitchen. Didn't even realize The instapot would blow me away again. Five stars all the way around."
5.0 out of 5 stars,This is just a great set and forget.  Can put food in before going out and just leave it it will finish and then just keeps the food warm for some time so when you get back just seat and eat.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I found that using the Instant Pot to make bone broth was very easy--fast, and turned out a more gelatinous broth.  The Instant Pot makes flawless rice (and I've been using a rice cooker for many, many years, so you can imagine I'm shocked to say I found something better).  I'm still learning the ins and outs, and look forward to using my Instant Pot more.I'm old enough to remember cookbooks, and in conjunction with recipes on the web, I'm very glad I got some cookbooks too."
4.0 out of 5 stars,Its too big for us. We should have ordered smaller one.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"In the month-and-a-half since receiving this pressure cooker, have cooked in it every day that I have cooked.  Everything from main dishes to side dishes, seafood, yogurt, breakfast, you name it.At first, mostly cooked up the ""freezer meals"" I had already prepared and in my freezer since that was where a lot of my food budget had gone.  These were mostly designed to be dumped into a slow cooker, but I had been cooking mine in a low-pressure, stove-top pressure cooker.  But now just cook them in the IP even faster and it has a stainless steel liner.Suggestion:  If you use freezer meal plans, seperate the veggies from the meat. In a slow cooker, veggies and meat cook in about the same time.  In the pressure cooker, veggies cook much faster and would become mushy if you cook as long as meat.  Not that meat takes that much time.  Better to cook and remove the meat, then cook veggies in the liquid left behind."
5.0 out of 5 stars,I love kitchen appliances!  We store it under the sink and moved the garbage can.  I use this for homemade yogurt so I can make the kids smoothies everyday.  The yogurt is so delish!  I've also found a couple recipees that I reuse twice a month because the whole family enjoys them.  Its really nice being able to cook a whole dinner in one pot.  I would highly recommend buying an additional RING.  One ring for savory dishes and one ring for sweet dishes.  I was really nervous to try this product but I'm so glad that I did.  Its great!
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Absolutely one of the most well loved kitchen appliances our family has ever owned.  So much so, we bought our daughter one for Christmas. Not too many meals slide by without being used.  We love the fact you can go from frozen to table in less than 30 minutes.  My wife didn't ""hate"" cooking - but she certainly didn't look forward to our evening meals. Now she tells me that she looks forward every day to scouring Pinterest and Facebook (Instant Pot Community Facebook page) for easy nightly recipes. Of course, I reap the benefits of her searching. Breakfast, Lunch, and dinner are now a much awaited activity .  Thanks Instant Pot. And Thanks Amazon for saving us money on this purchase."
5.0 out of 5 stars,I am late to the instant pot (modern day pressure cooker) party! I don't know why I drug my feet when it came to this purchase! I have used the instant pot practically every day. No kidding! Due to food allergies I cook almost every meal at home an this has cut my cooking time in half! This size pot has been perfect for our family of four.
5.0 out of 5 stars,I love it! I’ve only been making basmati rice and I get perfect rice in only 3 minutes!Jasmine rice is only 1 minute. I make it for my dog.It also keeps your food warm for up to 10 hours. This is very convenient for me to warm up rice dishes in particular. I hate the microwave and only use it for storage and it’s hard to warm up rice in a pan.I love that it’s stainless steel and therefore non toxic also.I couldn’t be happier with my Instant por!
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I really like this Instant Pot DU080 8 Qt 7-in 1 Multi use.  I Have not gotten use to it yet.  I do have trouble programming when I want to change the cooking method and cooking time.  Since this Instant Pot does not have a manual button, that is the cooking setting I am having trouble with.  I have used a pressure cooker for years and love it.  As I have gotten older, it is just not as easy to understand new things!"
4.0 out of 5 stars,"You can cook quality, hot food within three times of normal cooking time.A book with good recipes can be downloaded from the company website.It is necessary to disassemble sealing rubber every time before washing the appliance."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love ❤️ this little pot is one of the best investments I've made this year!  Having a blast with it. This is my first steamer, so still getting to learn the ropes. But all in all it's been pretty easy/user friendly. Have made pork, chicken, and beef plus tons of veggies. All have come out to perfection with the steamer. Have to figure out slow cook still. Tried something last night on high and after four hours vagus were still pretty hard. Probably operator error. I highly recommend this product."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I use this instapot every day. I really like having it! It’s perfect for cooking tender roasts and pork shoulder. I’ve made a whole meal at once by putting in frozen veggies, seasoned butter, and large cleaned shrimp. 5 minutes later I had cooked shrimp, melted butter and cooked veggies. I LOVE cooking eggs in it. The yokes come out so creamy and fluffy so long as you put them in the ice bath when it’s done. I haven’t used it to cook rice, make a cake, or make yogurt, but I’m happy to have the option. Works like a charm. Now I know what all the fuss was about."
1.0 out of 5 stars,There’s something wrong with the pressure seal on the pot I received. I had the smaller instapot previously and it worked fantastic but for whatever reason the larger version seems to have a defective pressure valve because mine takes forever to seal resulting in all my cooking times being drastically off.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"LIFECHANGING!!!  I have a toddler with 10 food allergies and a husband who strongly prefers anything homecooked over eating out so for a working mom like me, this product is GAME CHANGER!  I was barely cooking for my husband (maybe 3 nights a week) since I have to cook for my child with lots of food allergies.  Now with the Instant Pot, I cook EVERYDAY even on days I'm sick!  I enjoy cooking but the pressure to cook everyday has been a bummer for me.  This is as easy to use as a rice cooker, AMAZING!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,This is a great kitchen item. We use ours all of the time and makes eating a good meal with limited time quick and delicious. Also makes the best chicken in the world. Always cooks perfectly! Purchased this one for our 25 year old son and he loves it too! Easy breezy cooking :)
1.0 out of 5 stars,I got to use this ONCE. It no longer works.
5.0 out of 5 stars,Wonderful product for busy people and families on the go. I think we're going to enjoy having this in the house for quite some time. We use it at least two or three times a week and couldn't go back to using a traditional slow cooker or crock pot. The instant pot has definitely claimed its real estate on our kitchen counter and is worth every inch of it. If you have any doubt in your mind about whether you'll use this thing get that thought out of your head now and add this to your cart immediately. There's no way you'll regret it.
1.0 out of 5 stars,The pot almost exploded. I have never experienced something like this. Could have been defective but Not safe by any means.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"My husband is afraid of stove-top pressure cookers. He once heard a horror story about one exploding and has built it into his head that this is the only possible result of using one. For his birthday this past year I purchased our InstantPot so we could enjoy the pros of pressure cooking with less of the cons. I'll tell you right now, once he saw ""Pressure Cooker"" on the box he told me to return it. He was absolutely NOT interested. But once I opened the InstantPot website and made him read through the details, he became intrigued. It still took me roughly six months to get him to use it on his own, but I've been enjoying using it since Day 1. I use it to boil eggs, make shredded chick and corned beef, and I make rice in it at least once a week.Our kitchen has too many appliances taking up counter space, but this one definitely earns its keep. Who needs the blender out all the time anyway?"
1.0 out of 5 stars,"I have had two large size pots like this, two different brands.  Only a really small meal will not spray liquid all over with this smaller pot."
1.0 out of 5 stars,"I hate this thing. I wish I could return it. I wish it came with white glove delivery with someone who could show me how to work it.I'm half Japanese and I'm freaking anal about my rice. Why would I spend time gently washing my short grain rice until the water runs clear if I'm just going to put it in a cooker that turns it into pourage? You don't wash your rice? Ever? You're disgusting.Also, I set the slow cooker for four hours and the thing turns off 30 minutes later. Is 30 minutes the new 240 minutes? Is daylight saving time responsible for this?I thought a pressure cooker is supposed to create a fall of the bone quality but why does the finished product comes out looking and feel microwaved?Seriously though, I've cooked and thrown away more food than Salavation Army gave to my family when I was a child.My Scruff profile section entitled What I'm Into states, ""cooking and throwing away food with my awesome Instant Pot Duo plus 60"".What's wrong with me? Or rather, what's wrong with this device?"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love how easy and fast it is to use once acclimated to it. It’s nice recipes are included. Lots of options based on what your making. The silicone seal easily absorbs odors of what’s being cooked, so ordering a couple extra seals may be a good idea, especially when making a dessert versus something with strong spices. I’ve also had suggestions to soak the seal in a vinegar water solution to neutralize odors in the seal if needed."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Since Christmas my daughter uses this at least 3 times a week.  Fast quick easy and healthy for her family.  She is so happy with this product.  I have one and that is why she wanted one.  Great buy, won't be disappointed!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,I have had this for a couple of months now and used it 6 or maybe 8 times for various dinner dishes using both pressure and slow cooker settings.  Made oatmeal a couple of times for Tai Tai also. Easy peasyI am getting to REALLY like it and look forward to using other features such as making yogurt etc.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've used this for several meals now and it works as advertised. However, they don't include the minutes it takes to build pressure so when they say something takes 10 minutes, it really takes 13-14 minutes. But I have to say that it boiled potatoes faster than in a boiling pot."
3.0 out of 5 stars,It has not been as great as it had been made out to be. The multi-function aspect has been okay at best and the slow cooker does not work very well. I don't feel there is anything that I have made better in this than I could have on my stove.I find it best for making basic pantry items such as rice and broth. I also occasionally pan fry things using the sautee function just because it's less mess.I would not feel the need to run out and replace if it died. I suppose it's mildly convenient now that I have it though.
1.0 out of 5 stars,The product was not late in being reported for a refund. Reason for return it stopped working in the Yogurt feature. You refunded $88.36 and I paid $99.00 for it.  All requirements were met for the return.  Please answer me on this no reason for a deduction all guidelines were followed.
5.0 out of 5 stars,I use this pot almost daily.  I put my rice cooker away and also my slow cooker.  Things cook so well in this pot and so easy to use.
3.0 out of 5 stars,The product arrived in undamaged packaging. When the gift was opened on Christmas Day there was a big old dent in the side. There was no way this could be seen before the box was unpacked. I didn't buy a skin and dent item but that is what they received. Like I had tried to cheap out. Item had to be damaged prior to shipping. Waiting to hear from Manufacturer.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This pot can be used stand alone to sauté and then add ingredients for pressure cooking.  Really appreciate the separate button for the pressure release valve on this model, reducing risk of finger burn when releasing the pressure.  Wish we'd had one sooner!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is amazing! All of a sudden my girlfriend is able to not only make edible food but delicious food as well! So easy to use, and the food turns out incredible. Since the first use, we now use our InstaPot 5+ nights a week Can't wait to explore more recipes!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"So far we’ve made sweet potatoes, boiled eggs with the shells that fall right off, white and brown rice, and beef broccoli. I like being able to walk away knowing the food will be done quickly and efficiently."
5.0 out of 5 stars,I bought a second one of these as a gift for my daughter. They are wonderful for making quick meals. Meat comes out juicy and tender.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Are you a working adult who likes to eat fresh home cooked meals?? So am I and I cannot believe I put off getting an instant pot for so long. There was a little bit of a learning curve when I first started cooking in it, but after the initial fear of scalding myself doing a manual release, this small appliance is my best friend. I absolutely LOVE this product and have bought several as gifts for family members."
5.0 out of 5 stars,Now that I have lived with the Instant Pot for some time I have to say U am pleasently surprised.  There is a learning curve to be certain but that aside it is a very good product.  Much as with a microwave oven you will learn what you like and don't like to use this appliance for.  I am happy with the purchase.
4.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm learning how to cook all over again. Some things turn out great, some not as well. It'll take some time adjusting to this new way of cooking. Don't be fooled in to thinking it will be less time though. It takes awhile to get up to pressure (sometimes half an hour), then cooking time and then time to release pressure. Overall it takes a little longer than normal, but the food often turns out better. Eggs and chicken are the best. Chicken is super tender and moist."
5.0 out of 5 stars,Best purchase I have made in a while. There was a recall on the pressure cooker I bought and so I tossed it out because it wasn’t worth the coupon of another one just like it. I love having so many different options to make in this and the time it saves me in the kitchen. I also love that I was able to find a huge group on Facebook that has been a ton of support with any questions I have about this product.
5.0 out of 5 stars,Wow! I'd been following the trend on social media surrounding these miracle pots and ordered one (full price!) before Christmas. What a wonder! So far everything I've cooked in it has come out perfectly. There are thousands of recipes and lots of online help if you're intimidated by the idea of a pressure cooker. These aren't your Granny's pressure cookers!
3.0 out of 5 stars,"I know that some people are going to respond to this review saying that I am full of mud and this is indeed the best device ever created because they don’t want their feelings hurt.However, don’t even dream of cooking rice in this thing.  It takes way too much trial and error. It’s a rice destroyer. Just get a rice cooker such as a Zojirushi.Other than that I think it may be promising."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"The same great cooker, yet smaller. Perfect for a couple to make smaller portions, yet still has plenty of room for leftovers! Has all the same features with a much smaller footprint. Very happy with purchase!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This instant pot became a staple of my kitchen as soon as it was delivered. I bought it last October and has consistently used it every week. It's perfect for batch cooking. I also love how it doesn't require too much attention when cooking stews, soups, chilis, beans, or pressurized one-pot meals."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Amazing product.  If you don't own one....I strongly suggest it.  We have a larger family...2 adults, 3 kids.  We owned a 6qt Insta pot and unfortunately couldn't make enough for seconds.  Now we utilize both a 6qt and 8 qt and are loving the recipes.  At first it may be confusing (there are many MANY functions and buttons) just keep at it and reach out in one of the hundred facebook pages devoted to Insta pot users."
1.0 out of 5 stars,"Ordered this for xmas, not only was it delayed at transit but also came banged up - the package was perfectly fine but the actual instantpot was badly dented - this means thats the damage was caused during assembly and all quality control measures failed or the assembly workers didn’t give a crap."
5.0 out of 5 stars,Love it so far. Love the automatic steam release! Reasonably priced and arrived quickly.Just hope it lasts better than my 8 qt.  Duo Nova that blew a low pressure sensor after 6 months.
5.0 out of 5 stars,Love this Lid!! I have made gluten-free “fried chicken” that tasted amazing and the texture was worth the price if this lid in one dish!  And kale chips in five minutes! Great addition.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Oh my gosh, what a find!  I love the air fryer feature.  It does a small amount but perfect for a single or couple.  I have also tried the dehydrator for herbs.  Works very nicely.  One of my favorite kitchen gadget!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is a great product.  Easy to use and works just as described.  The only catch is that even if something only takes 5 minutes to cook it likely takes 10 minutes to heat up and sometimes another 10 to release the pressure.  So in some, rare cases it is not exactly instant.  But even in those cases (e.g. hard boiled eggs) it is just easier to use the instant pot to get perfectly steamed eggs with no pots to watch."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love the lid! I’ve been hesitant to get it for months, but now I’m wondering why! It makes amazing fries and shake n bake so far!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,My girlfriend has used this a lot more than me so far but she loves it and it seems to do a lot of things quickly. So far so good. Easy to clean. Not sure about the quality of the utensils that come with it but luckily we already had our own so we don't need to use them.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"We have loved this product!  I am by no means a chef but have you tubed simple recipes and this is so easy to use.  Food is easy to cook. My favorite has been cooking ribs.  For us we use the costco baby backs, mix one cup of water and one cup of your favorite bbq sauce, add two full racks cut in half and set the timer for 26 minutes.  Then we coat them with our favorite bbq sauce, place them on a cookie sheet and put them in the top rack for 6-8 minutes on broil.  Pure magic!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have bought three as gifts and one for myself. This is another dimension to cooking. It takes a lot of the question and fear out of pressure cooking. It is very easy to use. The meat from here was super tender. Soups that take hours normally take 1/2 hour for all. I'm probably getting a small one too as a second pot to do other ingredients. Get some cookbooks, read the instructions. To not use this to the extent it can be is criminal."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought the instant Pot for my wife because she asked for one, but I like it as much as she does. I do think that the 8 quart model is likely needful for all but those living alone who don't eat much. Any kind of beans turn out with good taste and texture quickly. I like the ritual of extended cooking for chili, but sometimes I need to cook a pot quickly, and the pot is good for that. Tough cuts of meat are quickly reduced to tender shreds for tacos. It's also good for making bone broth."
1.0 out of 5 stars,"Not built to last... I used this pot maybe twice monthly at most. It was good while it lasted. It is now out of warranty. I still contacted instant pot to see what they recommend. It will not turn on when plugged in. The power cord is still good. If it’s not fixable, I doubt I will purchase another. It should last longer than this."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Life changer. Thought it would just be used a few times a month. I use it a few times a WEEK. Simple things—7min hard boiled eggs for salad, 20 min potatoes for perfect mashing, 12 min rice that is PERFECT every time. Ribs? Fast cook then broil in the over and you are in HEAVEN. Crappy cuts of meat turned into tender, juicy stew meat. Put your homemade bologese in her for 1hr and it will taste like it has cooked 8 hours."
5.0 out of 5 stars,I have always been very leery of pressure cookers and never got enamored of slow cookers. What convinced me to get this was a foodie group I belong too. So far so good.  I think this will be my go to for soups and stews. Very easy to use. Cleans up like a dream. I do like the saute setting but I think I might use my big non-stick skillet to brown 3+ lbs of meat for chili.  Haven't used it yet for anything other then pressure cooking. However I do intend to take it though all it's paces. Looking forward to many adventures and wonderful meals with our Instant Pot.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love, love, love it. It's my new favorite small appliance. I really didn't know how to use it so I went on YouTube and watched a few videos and have used it almost every day since. Quick and So Easy. I really just love it."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I am so lucky to get this Instant Pot Fryer Lid.  I have a 6 qt duo and this thing fit the machine perfectly.  Now I can air fly, boil and dehydrate easily.  No extra machine to take up extra space.  Love it."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"My husband and I have used this for everything from rice, to Brazilian feijoada, to ribs, pulled pork, buffalo chicken wings, shrimp stew, mac and cheese, chicken soup, bbq chicken, steamed vegetables, whole chickens, turkey breasts...Everything we have made has been, without question, the best dish we have ever tasted. Love chicken noodle soup? Try it in this pressure cooker. It'll be the best you've ever had. Love ribs? Try them in the Instant Pot. Best ribs ever.We even got another pot so we could make multiple dishes quickly.Completely satisfied."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This works great! I have found it fairly easy to navigate, as far as buttons go, and haven't had any issues with how my food comes out (other than pure user error). I find the Instant Pot website cooking tables to be very useful when trying to figure out how long to cook an item. I primarily use this to cook beans and veggies, but I've also made soup in it. Everything has turned out great!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"The only pressure cooker to use, with huge support groups out there to help with recipes and information. Could easily be the only cooking appliance needed, including the stove! Have become dependent on it and really love it. Use ALL the time for soups, stews, even desserts. Try searching for the many IP groups on Facebook! You will never run out of recipes. Very easy to clean with soap and water and Barkeeper's Friend for ultimate shine. Very well made with super company supporting all inquiries. Thank you, Canada!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"BEST kitchen appliance I have. Versatile, easy to clean, and doesn’t take up too much counter space. SO MUCH BETTER than an air fryer."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"The Instant Pot is awesome. I try to find reasons to cook in it, and cook in it as often as I can. Pork country-style ribs, beef ribs, hard boiled eggs, turkey breast, BBQ chicken legs. And we reheat food in it too, in a double stack, stainless steel steamer pan. It tasted much better then microwaving it."
3.0 out of 5 stars,It is a wonderful Product but I’m not sure if the bottom of the pot is to be flat because mine is not which causes some issues while sautéing or steering before cooking it’s not the hardest to clean but it’s not the easiest either and I strongly recommend purchasing extra rings when you purchase this and not store all the rings together because they will start to absorb the odor of other foods very easily even if you deep clean them.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This really makes life easier.  This cooks food so much quicker than other methods.  I don't even use all of the functions yet but I love it.  Easy to use,  clean,  and put away. This also makes quick work of dried beans."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love how the food comes out instead of turning in the oven. However, the grease splatter onto the unit and fan is tricky to clean. I had to unscrew (void warrenty?) it to get a better cleaning. The basket is okay. I have to ""season"" the basket before cooking and sometimes still stick. Overall, I like it. I hope they will come out with replacement baskets!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,I don't have words for how awesome this appliance is.  It helps preps dinner quickly (if I can't cook them in the pot).  I would plan on more time than what most recipes call for...our roasts don't always come out as quickly as recommended.  This does NOT take away from the 5 stars awarded because it has changed our family's life.
3.0 out of 5 stars,"Loved using it, and used it often.  But I definitely expected it to last longer than a year.  The plug in the bottom of the unit broke its seal and it leaked all over the kitchen.  Luckily it was not turned on yet.  Very disappointed."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I use the Instant Pot 3-4 times a week easy, I am amazed how useful and functional this pot is. I think for a working mom it is a true life saver. Rice with chicken and vegetables in minutes, pasta from box and meat from frozen with stock and a meal ready in minutes, do chicken breast or red meat and cook to shred and use into your meal creations, everything ready in 20 minutes or a lot less. I really love this. I also got one for my mom who is an old fashion stove top pressure cooker convert. You'll love this too."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I like the pot for making batches of homemade yogurt, way better than store bought. It was a learning curve however. And you have to set it to ""boil"" twice to get it to 180 degrees, which is first step in yogurt making. No big deal.  I like it for cooking meats in too. Cuts the time to less than 1/3 of in the oven cook times. Planning to use it for a lot more things soon.  Good price on Amazon."
1.0 out of 5 stars,"The pot worked well, but there was a defect in the lid. Called manufacturer and described the defect to see if they would replace the lid. After giving them the serial number which they requested, they replied that since my pot was not on the defective list, they would do nothing for us. This tells me they are selling products they know are defective. They actually have a list of defective products which are for sale, or have been sold. Many thanks and stars for Amazon, who backs products they sell, even when the manufacturer will not"
1.0 out of 5 stars,Love the lid..easy to use. The coating on the basket peeled away after only 2 uses. Instapot said they'd replace...8 months later I still can't use my lid as they'd no replacement basket yet.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"My wife wanted one of these for her birthday.  We had some friends who have a similar instant pot and rave about it.  I'm the skeptic, but we got it and have used it several times.  It does a fantastic job making meals that are tasty and quick.  The keep warm function is particularly nice as it keep the soup we made warm, but didn't scorch the bottom.  The removable cooking insert is also great for cleaning. I highly recommend the Instant Pot."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Good deal for the money. I got it because it was on sale and got the 8 qt size; I've had good use out of it. Easy to use, easy cleanup."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Surprisingly, we use this a lot more than I’d have expected. It can save cooking time and make dishes (chili, ribs, stew, etc.) that taste really good. My only complaint so far is that it lacks the heat input needed to brown many foods in a reasonable period of time (as compared to a 20,000 BTU gas burner, for example). Otherwise, we’re liking it!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I got mine during the black friday deal and couldn't be any happier. I've made soups, pork, chicken, baby back ribs in this thing. Yes practice makes perfect and you need to play with it to get your perfect dish. Love the features and how easy it is to clean. I understood why people buy this in different sizes. I got the 6qt and it's the perfect size for our family. If you have a larger family maybe 5 or more people I would recommend getting a larger one but mine will feed a family of 4 and keep them full!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I  looked at many reviews of competing products before deciding on purchasing my Insta Pot and I have not had one regret. Its versatile, cuts cooking time to the minimum and handles frozen ingredients like meats and vegetables without any challenges. This is a truly remarkable product."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I originally bought this size because no one in my home had any interest in moving away from the traditional stove top pressure cooker and 6 quarts for just me didn't make much sense. After seeing what the Instant Pot could do my mother wants a bigger one for the house. This thing is a god send for my mini meal preps, it even put my rice cooker out of commission. If you're cooking for a lot of people I'd suggest getting a bigger size but this is definitely worth the money."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I like the big, deep inner pot for this instant pot. It's able to cook several pounds of meat to tender in less time than a Crock-Pot but will automatically turn to keep warm so nothing burns. Comes with recipe ideas, recommended cooking times and detailed instructions."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"It’s hard to understand at first, definitely watch a few insta pot basics on YouTube , once I got the hang of it it’s my new favorite thing in the kitchen! So many uses I can brown meat slow cook pressure cook FROZEN chicken in 15 minutes make rice it goes on"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love it!!! Makes dinners so much faster to make now. I haven't mastered pork in it yet, it seems to come out dry. Me and pork do not get along, it always comes out dry no matter which method I use to cook. Maybe I just need to play around with the time on the IP, I dunno but I haven't given up on pork yet!!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"The Instant Pot has become my new most loved kitchen appliance. Even my husband is amazed by its features. The book of instructions left a little to be desired in clarity for first time set up. But Instant Pots YouTube channel soon had me up and running. I teach a Whole-Foods, Plant-Based (WFPB) healthy lifestyle program and practice what I preach. That means lots of whole grains, legumes and beans in our house. With Instant Pot, no more spending all day with various pots on the stove. I love that in just about an hour I can cook up enough of each for an entire week, pack them away in the refrigerator and get out of the kitchen an on with my life. I look forward to using the yogurt setting later this winter. I'll keep y'all posted."
5.0 out of 5 stars,I bought this as a gift for my daughter.  Working full time makes it hard to cook especially for one.  She wasnt initially thrilled to get a pot but once she tried it she loved it.  She has been with different ingredients and has been happy with everything she made. And it's easy one pot cleanup.  I had no issues with the product or delivery.
5.0 out of 5 stars,This is a welcomed addition to my kitchen. It’s so easy to use and clean. This school year will be so much easier for making meals. Not only will it slow cook but will keep food warm without overcooking. I bought my pot in July during Amazon’s sale. It is worth every penny.
5.0 out of 5 stars,I love this so much can a pain in the butt to clean dependent depending on a cooking it but very easy to use there's a lot of help online and a lot of tutorials for different recipes and cooks the food almost perfectly every time
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought the Instant Pot DUO Plus 60, 6 qt,. because I was looking for a faster way to do dinners.  It has been a growing experience making sure I use the Instant Pot correctly.  I have not been disappointed.  I love the Instant Pot and have not been at all disappointed in the meals I have prepared from the Instant Pot cookbooks I purchased at the same time.  My family loves everything I have made with the Instant Pot."
3.0 out of 5 stars,"The pot functions beautifully but it arrived missing the condensation cup. I emailed Instant Pot vendor but no response. Great pot, poor shipping quality control and customer service. I only bought the IP brand for the manufacturer support, otherwise I would have saved money and gotten more features on another brand"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I freaking love this thing! We're Paleo(ish). Whole, frozen chicken from the farm in an hour and a half? Fresh chicken bone broth. Eggs collected this morning and hard boiled peel like a charm. Anyone who hard boils super fresh eggs can appreciate that one. Worth the price of the Instant Pot right there! Beef stew to DIE for. Convinced my sister to get one. She loves it, too. Hardest thing about owning this thing is having to time the bone broth cooking with needing to hard boil eggs...sometimes I wish I had two Instant Pots :)"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Let me first say that I am a hardcore foodie and wannabe chef who can be quite snobby when it comes to her cooking products. I LOVE the instant pot! This product has changed the way I cook, the amount of time that I need, and my weekly meal prepping for my family and I. I highly recommend getting the 7 in 1 multi-functional version of the instant pot, if not only for the yogurt feature. I have made my own greek yogurt at home weekly for a very long time and even though the instant pot does not shorten the time that is required to make yogurt, it does so without having to go through all of the tedious steps (besides draining at the end if you want greek yogurt). Also, unlike other pressure cookers, the instant pot also has a saute feature so that you can brown your meat and other ingredients prior to pressurizing. This is the second instant pot that I have purchased and I joke that someone out there has left their oven behind for just this one machine. It's amazing! There are many facebook groups for instant pot recipes and plenty of food blogs online that utilize them. You won't be disappointed in buying this product!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,I gave this to my mom as a birthday gift. We both tried it out and cooked a few meals together and we love it! So easy to make delicious food without too much effort. I would highly recommend this to anyone who wants to make their lives a little easier or convince their friends that they are an amazing chef.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"OMG!  I cook in this nearly daily, and some days multiple times.  Better than sun tea every other day. Yogurt a couple times a week, that I strain into Greek yogurt, sour cream, and cream cheese.  A few dinners every week.  There's a ton of recipes I'm anxious to try. Recipes are plentiful in the Facebook instant pot community, and on Pinterest.  Perhaps the best purchase I've ever made, and certainly the best kitchen appliance. I've heard nothing but good about Instant Pot's customer service too."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Words can not express how much I love my Instant Pot. I cleared out a whole cupboard (I am not kidding) when I gave away all of the small appliances that this replaced. I gave away: old school pressure cooker with rocker, yogurt maker, rice cooker, two-piece steamer and two slow cookers (I should have kept one!). I joined a Facebook group and have found all kinds of recipes and ideas for the Instant Pot."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"Be aware of which whare house it’s being shipped from. I got mine on time but the box was damaged and worse, the Instantpot was severely dented! It looked like someone smashed it with a hammer. Luckily after complaining to customer service about the poor product they sent me, they decided to ship me a free replacement which came in two days later. Other than that, the product is awesome. I love it. They have several YouTube tutorials on how to use it and also various recipes to make."
4.0 out of 5 stars,Great product just like the instant pot. Seems a little smaller than I expected but it works great and cooks food evenly and quickly. Great value for the price.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Instant pot is an amazing gift to my kitchen. I am using this pot to cook all types of biriyanis, variety rices, sambar, kesari, venpongal, sweet pongal, chicken gravy and vegetable curries. The sambar which I make using this pot is delicious."
2.0 out of 5 stars,Lock feature broke after 1 year and the company would not replace it... ended up in the trash! So sad
1.0 out of 5 stars,Defective as not working after a year. Will always but with insurance or local store to get warranty (min 3 years) for easy replacement.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I am I. Love with this purchase! I held out for so long thinking I didn’t ‘need’ another kitchen appliance. Boy, was I wrong! This thing has replaced my slow cooker and makes healthy meal prep easier. I use it multiple times per week! Be sure to follow instant pot groups on FB for great recipes."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"After my traditional pressure cooker blew up and covered my ceiling and everything around it with the inside liquid contents I ordered the Instant Pot. I will never, ever, ever use a stove top pressure cooker again after that scary & messy experience. The Instant Pot is very clean, quiet, easy to clean, and everything I could ever have dreamed for. Best purchase ever!!!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I am in love with my instant pot.  It is so versatile and easy to use.  I've tried smothered Pork Chops, Chicken and Stuffing, Beef Stew and Corn Chowder and everything was amazing.  The One Pot meals save me a lot of time.  I really like the ""Keep Warm"" feature, it works for us because my husband isn't always ready to eat right away and we still get a HOT meal.  Great product!!!  The Instant Pot Cookbook is a must and that will be my next order from Amazon."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I’m still learning but have made yogurt, beef stew, chicken & rice, chocolate oatmeal and a few other things. It’s versatile and easy to use. The only reason I gave it 4 stars on cleaning is because no matter what we’ve tried to remove the stew smell from the gasket it still has a very strong odor. We even soaked it in vinegar water. I did read that this was an issue from others so I ordered extra gaskets for making yogurt and other more delicate flavors and saved one for the savory meals. Otherwise I can see my Instant Pot getting a lot of use!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"So easy to use, so versatile. I'm french and I love cooking soup and other pressure cooked dish. The setting that allows to sauté first and they program the pressure cooking, makes it so easy for me. We have it since over a month now and we do most of our cooking in it.One time I didn't put enough water, so the bottom start to burn. But the appliance alarmed me, and displayed ""Burn"" and turn itself off. So it's very safe."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love the instapot.  I was able to recreate many of my recipes in 1/3 of the time.  Every night I am cooking up a storm.  I enjoy using my own ingredients and impressing my friends.  On the other hand, the pot is not very intuitive- you do need to read the manual and recipes to figure out how to use the functions, especially the pressure cooker. There are three steps to the pressure cooker process - warm up - cook - and then the steam dissipates. Time is misleading."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"What’s not to like? My mother used a pressure cooker and always had to watch and time it when we were kids. To see that I can drop in my ingredients, press a button and walk away is truly amazing! Everything comes out perfect and it even keeps it warm after it finishes cooking! I’m purchasing 2 more for my mother and mother-in-law!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is a good deal for an instant pot! I didn't get the craze like all of my friends, until my husband got me this a couple months ago. I have enjoyed the ease of cooking. Setting it and leaving and not working around the kitchen as much. My one recommendation to the company is to send a lid that would fit on the pot for the fridge."
3.0 out of 5 stars,"For a ""like new"" warehouse deal, it arrived in a smashed up box and dirty contents. The box worries me less than the inside. Warehouse deals are described as ""like new contents"" with flawed boxes. instant pot itself Looks crusty. Not impressed. We'll see if it works. Also doesnt have instruction manual."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"LOVE IT, LOVE IT, LOVE IT.  I HAVE USED PRESSURE COOKERS FOR YEARS BUT NOTHING LIKE THIS.  IT IS SO QUIET, I HAVE TO STRAIN TO HEAR IF IT'S WORKING..  EVERYTHING I MAKE IS QUICK AND GREAT.  CLEANS SO EASILY.  I LOOK FORWARD TO YEARS OF HEALTHY COOKING."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"So far, the Instant Pot has cut down cooking time considerably and is easy to use. We’ve made fish, chicken, beans, rice, risotto and oats successfully and have gotten complements. Still trying to figure out the yogurt making process, especially since I’m using coconut milk. App is helpful for recipes and getting a hang of it, but it’s definitely a good to have if you’re serious about doing healthier homecooked meals."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love this thing so much! It's pretty easy to use and clean, and it makes everything but popcorn (maybe it does that too). I have made yogurt, tapioca pudding, beans, grains, soups, sauces, all manner of veggies, and even eggs. Soups and sauces taste like they've simmered all day, but they take 15 minutes. It makes great hard-cooked eggs and pretty decent poached eggs once you figure out the timing. On that note, even though I cook by feel rather than by following recipes, I found it really important to follow recipes until I got the hang of ratios and timing."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have never used an electric pressure cooker before.  I remember the stove top style that my mother used to cook with when I was a kid.This product is fantastic!!!  Very easy to use.  Cooks really fast, which is great for nights when I get home from work and want a nice meal without all the time it takes to prepare and/or cook it.  We are able to eat earlier now, and that is a great reason to use this product.The food comes out very moist and fully cooked in a fraction of the time it takes to grill or bake.  I am going to buy a few more as gifts this Christmas season."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought this last January.  After nearly a year of use, we couldn't live without this.  I use it nearly every day for steaming vegetables.  It makes perfect corn on the cob in 8 minutes.  It makes amazing soups as well.  We make the very best mashed sweet potatoes...again, steaming the potatoes in under 10 minutes.  It's a miracle."
4.0 out of 5 stars,Dinner was always a chore for me. Life is always crazy and not a lot of time to cook. I had heard so many good things about the instant pot I just had to have one. So far I have been happy. So far the my only complaint is the food has not had enough flavor. When I cooked a ham it was not as flavorful as when I use my crockpot. I will continue to try and improve on that.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Well, I had been holding off thinking that I don't need another kitchen appliance gathering dust.  But was I wrong.  This Instant Pot saves me so much time!  And it is so easy to use.  I have been whipping up stews and curries and my husband could not be happier.  Word of advice; the ring gasket will pick up onion, garlic and spice aromas.  Buy extra rings to use when cooking neutral foods like rice or potatoes.  I love this!!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"The instant pot can be used to make almost anything!!!  Can saute and brown foods before adding additional items close and cook it on high pressure (cuts cooking time at least in half), or slow cook in it.  Even just to use it as a rice cooker it's great.  Food cooks fast and the pressure infuses food with more flavor from added spices.  It replaces 4 kitchen items I used to have on my counter!!!"
2.0 out of 5 stars,I guess I don't like steamed food! I used it once and sent it back. I really appreciated the ease of the return to AmazonSmile
5.0 out of 5 stars,We absolutely love it 😍. Vey easy to clean and can cook in less than one hour.
1.0 out of 5 stars,"Float valve blew out of the top and put a hole in the ceiling.  Product support sucks.  Waited 15-30 minutes each time I have called.  First time, rep was nice and said I would receive an email with how to proceed.  Never received.  Called back again and got a not so nice rep that interrogated me on why it broke lie it was my fault.  She finally said I didn't get the email due to it being mistyped by the first rep.  It was fully assembled, all I did was turn it on!  Still trying to get resolution for over a month now."
5.0 out of 5 stars,I finally bought this after borrowing a friends IP and also being part of IP group on FBLove the ease of this pot and the tasty dinners I can make quickly for days when work runs long.  The amazon deal of the day ($50 off) helped me go ahead and buy it.  Glad I did.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought this not really knowing if I would get a lot of use out of it but wanted to give it a try. First test, sticky rice, normally in my rice cooker takes 45 minutes. In this beauty 10 minutes and it was perfect. Then chicken, fork tender flavorful and ready in 15 minutes. My most recent selling point, 3 lbs of potatoes for mashed in 5 minutes. Everyone kept asking what else did you put in here. I cooked the 3 lbs of potatoes with 3/4 cup chicken stock and just added butter and butter milk, but they loved them and they were far more flavorful than we have had in the past. I can't wait to see what else I can whip up quickly in this bad boy."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"This instant Pot DUO I purchased in late 2016 and put it in use in early Jan 2017, all went well until early 2020 that an annoying beeping sound and an error code ""C6H"" flashing in the little display window, that kills it. Being a good owner of this pot, there is no split inside the heating element or any drop of this pot to the ground. The failure of it to work with this kind of error is really caught me off guard because I was just using it the night before w/o problem. Hopefully, the manufacture will still honor its product for repair or replacement."
1.0 out of 5 stars,"Do not use as a slow cooker, only good as a, pressure cooker.  Cooked roast and potatoes yesterday and meat is still not tender, carrots and potatoes still raw.  Seven hours on normal slow cook.  Another seven hours on ""high"" slow cook, still not done.  I deeply regret wasting money on this item."
5.0 out of 5 stars,Like it a lot!  Can make shredded beef from a chuck roast in an hour..delicious machine!
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Still a newbie, but really enjoying my Instant Pot. Everything I've tried in it so far came out perfect. Was a little intimated at first, being that I grew up with the old fashioned pressure cookers that would shake & hiss and often explode & splatter all over the kitchen. Very comfortable with this one. Use for making bone broths, soups & roasts and looking forward to trying all the other features! Was definitely worth the purchase, especially when I got mine during a lightning deal for just $78. Would have paid more for it, but just got lucky. Very happy with my purchase!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I recieved this as a gift, I was skeptical at first, now I could do their commercials! It's an amazing appliance! I use it at least twice a week. Pressure cooking is a big time saver, slow cooking is programable with set and forget convenience. Dried beans are so quick and easy and turn out perfect every time. [It's paying for itself] We regularly make the most delicious yogurt. I've had it almost a year and there's no end to the successes I've had with this remarkable unit."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"Does decent job cooking rice, but trial and error for cook time is mandatory until can get ""perfect"" rice.  Does not work well with Minute Rice or other quick-cook rice."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love love love LOVE my Instant Pot. I use it for quinoa (3-4 minutes), beans and rice. Makes things in no time and I love that it does not heat up the house so much. Also, I had trouble making beans and rice perfectly before the Instant Pot. Now I try to error on the side of under cooked and add time after if needed. There is a bit of a learning curve to mastering the IP but it is totally worth it! Also I enjoy fresh yogurt using probiotic capsules for homemade yogurt. One bit of advice- I use half the time listed in the manual as I find following the guideline cook times is way too long."
5.0 out of 5 stars,I don’t know how I functioned without this pot! Everything is a snap and it is extremely easy to clean. There is no shortage of recipes out there and I have barely started to explore all of its uses. Best purchase I have made in a long time.
4.0 out of 5 stars,"Helps really well for timed cooking, and also cooks all kinds of beans really quick and soft. No need for soaking over night for beans. Just select the type of beans and they will be ready in less than one hour."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Nothing not to love about this appliance. Thought I would use occasionally, but I use it all the time. I also love how easy it is to clean. Definitely need the glass lid that's sold separately."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love this!! Cooked ribs in it the first night. But the buttons on the front where it says manual isn't what mine says. The box it came in shows the word panel that is in the box. I got the 6 qt. pot with the 3 qt. panel pic. It isn't a big deal the pamplet shows you how to do it manually. But if you want to see what your 6 qt will look like look on the 3 qt. picture. So far I have cooked ribs, chicken soup, cheesecake, and crab legs!!! Followed you tube recipes."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"We are loving our new instant pot! So far everything is working great and the food we've cooked has come out really well. On a side note, if you plan to cook something like a pork butt, I would recommend a long marinade and slow cooking so the flavors really soak into the meat. My recipe usually calls for a 24-hr marinade and 4-5 hours in the oven, but we decided to do the standard cooking method just to try it out. My boyfriend liked it, but I knew it wasn't quite the same."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I was hesitant to buy another appliance for the kitchen, but am so glad I did!  When I first received it, I started using it everyday, and sometimes 2 times a day.  It has been fun trying new recipes and adjusting recipes to cook in the pressure cooker.  I like the keep warm feature and replaced my slow cooker with this all in one - slow cooker, pressure cooker, saute pan."
5.0 out of 5 stars,My first meal was red beans and rice my next was oatmeal was not well learned enough to know that I should have bought extra lid seals so my oatmeal wouldn't taste like red beans and rice.  Other than that it's been a joy to use for this family of 7!
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I really like this Instant Pot. I like the pre-set controls and the manual feature.I love cooking things in a much shorter time frame. So far, I have cooked Beef Roast with Veggies twice, Corned Beef and Veggies, Beef Vegetable Soup, and Smothered Beef Tips. I look forward to Boiled Peanuts and Pork Ribs. I only use this for items that take Hours to cook in the oven or stovetop. I have used to Saute function and it works well."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Worth EVERY penny! I highly recommend this product, it's amazing, SO easy to use (you do not need to watch hours of YouTube videos) and easy to clean and store. I watched a ton of videos because I was nervous to use it, but it's not as complicated as you might think. I haven't used many settings, but for the most part you just hit manual and then ""adjust"" to decide what pressure to use for pressure cooking. Super simple! And, if you still want to get a good tutorial, there's a great Facebook group for InstaPot and endless videos on YouTube."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I had an older rise cooker i got from costco that was about 5 years old and started to show its age.  This thing is awesome.  I use this thing several times a week.  It is an awesome slow cooker too.  One nice feature of this is that you can brown your food in it.  For example, then i make spaghetti sauce, i can can throw my onions and ground beef in first, brown them and caramelize the onions, and then through in the rest of the ingredients.  With my old cooker, if i wanted to brown something, i had to use a different pan.  Really great for making true one pot dinners."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love it!!  I use my Instant Pot more and more.  It has not only cut down on the amount of time it takes to cook a meal but it has made it easier.  I have found that I spend less time standing in front of the stove and that my kitchen is cooler.  I love all the one pot meals that I can make using a few steps, setting it and walking away.  If you cook a lot or a little this is definitely an item that will make your life easier.  I highly recommend this to everyone that ever cooks."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"This is our first pressure cooker Ever. I have to say, I Love it. Absolutely Love it. If you are looking at wedding gifts, this is a new Must Have - maybe not this model- no one should be without one.If I had really understood what I was buying, more than anything else, I would have gotten the bigger one. There's only 2 of us and that's how I feel, so I can't even imagine what it's like for ppl with kids. I would argue that as a long term investment, this 6qt is Only viable for single people, and side dishes.Yes, side dishes. That's the next thing. I could easily use another one of these. There's so much food prep that can be done in here (like 'boiling' potatoes in only 5 min) you almost need a second machine just dedicated to that purpose. Because no matter what it is, from browning meat to simmering soup, it all goes faster and tastes better in the instant pot.Which leads me to point 3: more pots. As in, the metal bowl type inserts where the cooking happens. The machine only comes with 1, and just like with your stand mixer, ya need more bowls, bc if you're making cake, you're making icing too, right? Same deal here. It only takes so many times of pulling that blazing hot insert out, washing it and getting it back in the pot to cook the next thing to know the product should ship with an extra.All that being said, I can't recommend the Instant Pot enough."
5.0 out of 5 stars,Got this as a gift forDIL.  She has been enjoying it and looks to air fry anything she can think of.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love to cook in my instant pot!If I forgot to thaw meat, no problem!Frozen chicken or beef"
1.0 out of 5 stars,"I could not be more disappointed with this purchase.  One of the two appliances purchased has never worked correctly.  The steam release valve does not properly seat itself, and constantly leaks steam, causing the pot to dry out and burn.  The company has been slow to respond to questions and ultimately has not provided a solution, or a return/replacement.  The product is a good concept but when it doesn’t measure up there is NO meaningful customer service.  I will start evaluating the competing brands for a more reliable  product."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"We love instapot, in fact this one is the second one we've purchased.  We bought this one for our daughter who is in college and she absolutely loves it.  She can cook rice, meat, beans etc all quickly or slowly throughout the day."
1.0 out of 5 stars,"Bought this to replace my ancient Revere that finally died.  I have to have an electric because I cook on an electric stove and cannot regulate the temperature enough to use a stove-top pressure cooker.  I use it weekly to hard boil eggs (peel perfectly every time.) and for pot roast, corned beef, stew, etc.UPDATE: Changed from five stars to one star.  After one year and 29 days, the InstantPot died.  Panel lights up, everything acts like it is working but no heat."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I loved my cooker so much, I bought this one for my son who is in college. He is a pretty experienced cook. After sending him a few recipes, he is a pretty proficient chef with this cooker!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"If you are cooking for one or two, the Mini is perfect! It is also very cute! I have an 8-quart Instant Pot for larger quantities, but the Mini has already become my most used appliance."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"Trips breaker switch. Can't use it. Replacement's steam valve didn't work. Have rent back for a full refund. Sad because I really wanted a working Instant Pot. Despite what others say, customerservice was excellent.Just reordered during prime days.  Love it now.  Just started using it and can’t wait to try more receipts."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Having the stainless steel inner pot is very important to me.  This is so easy to use and you can put frozen food in and it comes out tender when done.  Just remember the colder the food is when put into the pot the longer it will take for steam to begin and counter to begin.  This instant pot is so convenient and reduces cooking time tremendously.  Also, I have noticed that the flavors from spices and condiments really infuse into the food so you don't have to use much for seasoning.  Read your instructions well and you are set.  Just press the appropriate button for whatever category of food you are cooking.  So easy and easy clean-up."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Don't even think about it, just get it! I work in 2 different cities, always on the go. If you don't have time to cook every day, this thing will save your life in the kitchen! It lives up to the hype!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,Had a different pot and the lid was so difficult to engage that I hated to use it.  This is a dream.  So many settings and it works exactly as described.  I recommend watching the video.  The young lady does an excellent job explaining everything.  Great price.  I use it a great deal.  What a time saver!
5.0 out of 5 stars,I’m actually surprised at the versatility of this cooker and how well it works.  I agree with someone who said this is worth it if you only used it to boil eggs as well as it does.  It can replace my old pressure cooker.  I’m still trying to decide if it will replace my slow cooker.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I should have bought this a long time ago. Coming home from work and being able to put a meal together is less that an hour. The 6 quart is great for 4 to 6 people, but I wish I would have bought a 8 quart instead. I like to have left overs to take to work for lunch. Cooking for 5 to 6 people there are no left overs. So an 8 quart I would be able to cook larger quantities of food.Great for summer, no heat from the oven."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love this little pot. I love making egg bites and stews in it. It sat in the box for 6 months. But once I tried it, I am hooked.❤️❤️❤️❤️I have a pressure cooker that was hard to control. This is electronic and so amazing, I use it for everything."
5.0 out of 5 stars,I've used this a few times now and I love it! Easy to use as a beginner and not loud or unnerving like a regular pressure cooker. I bought the great food fast recipe book as well and I'm very happy with the results. Summers in Phoenix are pretty brutal so this is the perfect way to keep my house cool and have a delicious dinner.I bought mine used since Amazon tests and inspects it before putting it up for sale. Other than a dent in the side it works perfectly and cost me $40 less.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This versatile appliance is a bargain.  Paired with the Secura 6 quart basket insert, this can replaced a crockpot or a rice cooker.  Although it can be used to braise, I use a fry pan as my induction unit heats far faster than the Instant Pot.  I can then place the braised product into the Instant Pot.  Cleaning the pot is a breeze and the timer, while not exactly intuitive, works well and has a warm function.  I can now donate my rice cooker."
5.0 out of 5 stars,The directions were easy to follow and there are a lot of recipes that come with this device.  It works great just be careful when releasing the steam.  Great product.  We actually gave 2 to family members for Christmas.  Great gift.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought this for my wife since we both work and have three small children to feed after a long days work. I figured this would be a faster way to prepare food that would otherwise take a long time to cook. we were not disappointed!! It cooks food all the way trough right to the bone making all meats extremely tender. if you are looking for a quick way to prepare food with less clean up at the end of it all, then this is the machine for you. look no further and spend a little extra and buy this machine you will not be disappointed."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought this instant pot during the Christmas promotion for $70 50% off. It turns out to be one of the greatest things I bought from Amazon.It’s super easy to use and so convenient. I love Vietnamese Pho with ox tail and it ususally takes hours to cook this dish with constant attention. With instant pot, it takes me only 1/2 hour to prep and let it cook by itself for 1.5 hours (15 mins high pressure cook and 1.15 hrs to depressure. You can manually vent it if don’t want to wait.). The Pho turns out super good that my whole family enjoyed very much. Of course Pho is not the only dish that I can cook with this instant pot :)"
5.0 out of 5 stars,I've only cooked one thing with this(hush puppies)  but dang were they yummy.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've had my Instant Pot for a few weeks and am really liking it.  I've made several chicken dishes and a beef roast.  Meat is always tender and moist. There is a bit of a learning curve on timing, etc but i've just been experimenting. I did get the 8 qt and it is plenty big.  Could've probably got the 6 qt and been fine but.....  The best part is the easy clean up!  Everything is in one pot and the insert just comes out and is much lighter than a crock pot and cleans up so easily! I haven't made meat in my oven since I got it!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I normally don't buy cooking products often, as I don't cook at home that often. The Instantpot is easy enough to use, that I have actually started cooking at home! Coming from someone that usually eats out twice a day, 6 or 7 days a week, that shows how invaluable the Instantpot is. I wanted the larger 8 qt version which never gets put on sale, but the upfront cost was more than made up for by the savings I've achieved by cooking at home for some of my meals. The Instantpot is probably the best kitchen appliance for the money! It doesn't cook rice very well, but that's okay. I didn't expect it to hold up to the expensive rice cookers out there."
1.0 out of 5 stars,"I was excited about getting one of these, but nothing cooks as fast as it should. Even if I cook a few potatoes for 30 minutes they will still be hard in the middle. No steam is leaking, everything is sealed and I’m using it how I’m supposed to. I’m assuming it’s just defective but it’s been too long to return it so I’ll probably just throw it away."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought one because my daughter raved about it so much that it peaked my interest to buy one and try it out. Since I do a lot of cooking it was the answer to using less pots and pans to cook. It wasn't an over night learn, there was an adjustment period. Thanks to my daughter she was there for me when I needed help with my instant pot Now, I love my IP!  Glad I bought one !!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Not going to leave a long review, this product makes meal prepping easy. Does not take up a ton of kitchen space, easy to clean and great for one pot meals, stews, Even ribs and veggies. Meals are done very quickly and in combination with a rice cooker you can feed a large family in less than 15 mins. If your a student in a dorm, barracks or some other area where you live or work and have limited cooking space you should consider this. Anything you can make in a slower cooker you can make here plus a few other features. I have no experimented with the other modes but so far so good."
5.0 out of 5 stars,Although I’ve only had it for a few weeks I’ve already used it several times. It’s great for cutting down time on recipes and perfect for cooking pinto beans in less than an hour. Only 35 minutes for ribs. Makes excellent yogurt too!
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This thing is AWESOME!!!!  My dad was in town a few weeks ago and liked mine so much he went home and ordered his own!  It has worked wonderfully for everything I've made.  Haven't tried making yogurt yet, but will get to it eventually.  LOVE the way rice cooks up in this too.  I've made white, brown, and wild rice mixes, all have come out perfect.  Much better than my old actual rice cooker that was made specifically for rice, but always overcooked the bottom and made a whole layer at the bottom inedible  eBay"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"My bf and I can't get enough of this thing. I purchased it since I grew up with family members using the traditional stove top varieties, and while I wanted to cook with them, I was very intimidated. This product takes all the intimidation of pressure cooking away! And my bf and I both love the one-pot cooking and serious ease of clean up. I cannot recommend this product enough. We are using it at least once a day. In the am, I make soft boiled eggs. Dinners, we have made pork chops with veggies, chili, spaghetti (omg so good one-pot too), etc. WE LOVE IT. Haven't made rice in it yet, but it will happen soon."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is one of my absolutw favorite purchases!! I’m obsessed with my instant pot 😍. I use it almost every day, it’s so much faster than conventional stovetop cooking and extremely multifunctional. You absolutely will not regret this purchase. I’m considering the bigger one so I can do two dishes at the same time."
3.0 out of 5 stars,"First thing I cooked was spaghetti, it was awful, the gasket wreaked of nasty over cooked sauce.  I had to soak it in vinegar for days and it still slightly smells.  I made some soup in it and it kept saying BURN...I need to buy a book with proportional recipes for this 3 qt. cooker.  Probably wouldn't buy again...but not ready to give up on it."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"So far we have cooked red beans, pork roast and beef roast. All turned out great. I cannot believe I can come home from work spice up my large beef roast, (covered the whole bottom of the pan,) and an hour later it is so tender you can cut it with a spoon. It took 40 minutes for the pork roast.  Beware of the steam. I never release it without using a utensil.  Better safe than sorry."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love this thing! It is a set it and forget type of tool (after having some experience with it)...That said, it is NOT 'instant'. It may be a little faster in cooking, but it is far from 'instant'.Once you get the hang of using it though it is tremendously useful. I mine frequently...at least once maybe, twice a week depending on what our schedule looks like. It is certainly great for multi-day meal prep."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Now I know what everyone is bragging about with this instant pot. I’m sure that this will help with any future divorce plans. I love it, he loves it, very easy to use, instructions, you need to read several times. But what an excellent product!!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Definitely a good investment for anyone wanting meals fast.  I've enjoyed a wide range of recipes in this and it's worked fine.  I'm not the biggest fan of the ""memory"" function - it does want to have ""keep warm"" on concurrently with pressure cooking, which caused an error once, but since I was only making macaroni and cheese, it didn't ruin the recipe.  Now I know to watch for that once I select pressure cook and turn the ""keep warm"" function off right away."
2.0 out of 5 stars,"I was very pleased with this product until it died.  It just stopped working.  And now, even with insurance, I can't get a return label from Amazon.  I have to call product support and hopefully, then, I can return it. I had planned to exchange it but since Amazon has made it so difficult, I will probably just purchase it locally."
4.0 out of 5 stars,My only complaint about this pot is that the slow cooker option doesnt work like an actual slow cooker.  The low option on slow cooker is essentially a warm button on a normal slow cooker.  The medium operates like a low and the high operates like a medium.  Also doesnt operate the same as a slow cooker because it doesnt have a ceramic bowl to help circulate the heat.  Learnes this lesson the hard way when i put food in for 8 hours on low only to find out nothing inside cooked beyond the outer layer of the meat.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Read directions carefully and FOLLOW them faithfully and if you do then I think the product is very safe. It is also incredibly versatile, allowing one to cook multiple dishes sequentially and quickly with only one item to then clean. Add an air fryer and you are all set."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I was waiting to write this review until I made yogurt in this pot but I am realizing that it may be a while before I set aside the time commitment for that. Hopefully when I get around to making the yogurt I will update my review.I was very hesitant before I purchased since I really didn't need another small kitchen appliance. But I am so glad I pulled the trigger because I LOVE this pot. I bought this all-in-one to replace my Wolfgang Puck pressure cooker (which I loved). We have a small kitchen so I wanted to consolidate the pressure cooker, rice cooker and slow cooker with one unit. This is the unit. It's the same size as my WP pressure cooker. I love the sauté feature and the stainless steel insert. This unit has been easy to clean. I have made pork ribs, beef stew, soups, beans, chili....This is a great unit at a great price. I would recommend this to anyone who has a tiny kitchen. You can replace many things and make plenty of one pots meals in this."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love how many different things this pot can be used for.  To cook some meals I needed to order a 2nd insert so I could keep some food in first one without having to wash.  It was worth it.  The directions book does not give many recipes - I rely on the internet for most ideas and answers, and they are pretty good."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Got this for my wife.  I know what you are thinking, but she asked for it.  She has been using it more than the oven or stove to cook our meals ever since.  She has sautéed, cooked whole chickens, roasts, barbecue pulled pork, and more.  Works better than she ever thought it would.  Has come up as a topic with friends during casual conversation multiple times with my wife saying, ""you have to check it out!""."
5.0 out of 5 stars,I’ve only used mine once but I’m loving it. It wasn’t as difficult as it seemed once I got on Pinterest and YouTube for better directions.
5.0 out of 5 stars,Was a gift my daughter wanted. She likes it. I will be ordering another one!
5.0 out of 5 stars,Absolutely love this thing! Ribs..brisket..pulled pork..so many meals made quickly!! No need to wait hours on end. Debating on buying another so I can make larger meals for when I have gatherings of family or friends.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love how easy it is to use.  Just saute in the pot, add other ingredients and set to pressure cook.  No need to dirty extra pans.  Wish the recipe book / user manual woulf have been a bit more extensive, but no worries."
5.0 out of 5 stars,love it!  I sent my crockpot that I had just purchased back to buy this because it has so many additional easy to use functions.  the only thing is make sure you use an oil on the bottom of the pot to keep items from sticking.
2.0 out of 5 stars,"I did not use it.  The instructions say to remove the Anti-Block Shield in the lid.  I pressed as hard as I could to remove, but it wouldn't budge.  Can you imagine trying to remove it when slippery???  I'm so disappointed because I really wanted to love it."
5.0 out of 5 stars,Very useful pressure/slow cooker. Everything we made in it came out great. Set it and forget it and we love it. I wish they included an adjustable temperature setting at least for yogurt making since incubation temperature requirements are different for various yogurt starters.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is the best thing since sliced bread.  You have to steam or boil, you can't dry roast in it.  But you can make a meal quickly, use less energy, not heat up the kitchen with the big oven, and if you need to go out it will hold food at a food-safe temperature for up to four hours, so you don't have to stand there and tend the pot.  I got the one with a browning/saute feature which I highly recommend."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"Sadly my first IP is going to appliance heaven.  I've dropped the lid a few too many times and puppy once ran off with the regulator (that little thing on top that regulates pressure).  Even so I've used my IP every day, and sometimes twice a day and more, in the 2-1/2 years since I've owned it.  It's been reliable, easy to use, easy to clean, and it has always delivered deliciousness.  I can't imagine preparing a meal without it.  Over the last few weeks it slowed down and as of today I'm relegating it to being a slow cooker."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I wouldn't know what to do without my Instant Pot! This is the best thing I've ever owned. If you're on the fence about getting an IP, jump! Not only can in pressure cook foods to help you save time, it will keep the food warm. It also slow cooks, steams, sautés, and does the work of pretty much all other appliances combined. I love my IP!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,This was to give us a start on good home cooking and has done a fine job. Hardly a week goes by that we don't make a meal in this. We chose the 6 Qt because it's just the two of us and she doesn't eat leftovers! It works completely as advertised and has become an essential part of our cookware.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have had my Instant Pot for about 6 months.  I use it every single week. Sometimes I use it more than once per day. Yesterday I used it to make hard boiled eggs. Though I used to make eggs on the stove top, they are easy to make in the Instant Pot and they peel SO easily. After the eggs were done, I rinsed the pot and made potatoes.  I quartered red potatoes and cooked them on sauté with some herbs, beef broth,  and cocout oil.  I added some peeled carrots, cut in half.  I then cooked them on high pressure for 9 minutes.  They came out delicious and were such a welcome addition to our meal.  My children said they were their most favorite potatoes I've ever made.Some of my favorite recipes for the Instant Pot include herbed chicken,  one pot pasta in meat sauce, and chili.  There are lots of recipes for chicken, beef, fish, and beans in healthy sauces that you can find on the Internet.  My favorite recipes were collected from various Facebook groups for Instant Pot users.I was slightly intimidated when the Instant Pot first arrived, but I've since become adept at following recipes and even creating my own.  I've taken my Instant Pot foods to potlucks and received rave reviews.  I feel like being adventurous is easy with the Instant Pot and I've definitely tried many new things.  All were good,  most were great, and most were healthy.I haven't cooked any desserts or yogurt in the Instant Pot, but I know that's something people use it for often.  I am planning to buy the new, larger, Instant Pot, and keep two."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've been using this for many months now. Wouldn't want to live without it. People cannot believe how the meat just falls apart in so little time, like it's been cooking all day. I rarely use my crock pot anymore. Takes a while to figure out cooking time for your own recipes but I just write them down each time & adjust until I get it perfect. So many recipes on Pinterest & cookbooks for this, nobody can fail!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"So far, so good! Like others, I wasn’t sure why I needed an instant pot, and what could it do that my slow cooker couldn’t? As I kept coming across recipes that revolved around a pressure cooker, I had to try it. I’m so glad I did! So many things have become easier, especially pasta. Can’t wait to try more recipes!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"One of the few things I got for my kitchen that I use more than expected. The yogurt feature is one thing I didn't expect to use the IP for, but pleasantly surprised at the feature. Buying organic Greek yogurt is so expensive and the homemade version is just like Fage in taste, but organic, and cheaper, very little tartness. Almost like eating cheese. The other reason I love this machine is it really contains the smell of bone brothers. My husband didn't eat bone broth and hates the smell. The IP is way better for containing scent than slow cookers or stovetop."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"The learning curve takes a little bit of reading, not being afraid to push buttons and being careful to let out the pressure before removing the cover. Once you master that it makes cooking a breeze. Soups and stews that take 3 to 6 hours on the stove or 2 to 4 in a regular crock pot are ready in 30 minutes to under an hour with this baby.....and that includes a few times when the meat or chicken was still frozen. Less odors escape during the cooking process too, so you may not think your food is being cooked....but it is."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I still don't use it as much as I should - and I really need to figure out the best way to  implement it into a regular Cooking regime - but I think thats more about finding healthy recipes that maximize the strengths of this Instant.  But, for the things I have used it for - love it.  Seems that the pressure Coker makes some smells get imbedded into the  Sealing ring = pick up at least one spare if you want to switch from Savory to sweet cooking"
5.0 out of 5 stars,Got this on Friday and have already used it twice.  I have air fried frozen taquitos and sweet potato fries. Only took me less than 10 minutes.  They were so crisp!  So easy to use and cleans up really easily.
1.0 out of 5 stars,"Prepared three recipes from their own cookbook. The first one, a simple tomato soup, was fine.  The next two, a kale and white bean soup and a chicken curry, were inedible. I exchanged the 3-quart pot for a 7-quart pot.  Another disaster.This morning I am greeted by the news that there is a fire hazard.I would like a refund on the 7-quart pot, even though the date for a return was 1/31/2018.  I am a very good Amazon customer and I rarely ask for a refund.  Please e-mail me at holland5098@msn.com or call me at 303-663-5098,  where you can leave a  message.  I see Amazon as a behemoth that is taking over the world, so I am being very polite.  Thanks for your consideration."
5.0 out of 5 stars,First ever instant pot...easy to use and nice size
1.0 out of 5 stars,"I noticed a small bean size peel of the chrome grating after the first use. I should have used that as sign of trouble to come.  After about 3 uses, the seal leaked on the fourth time and the unit still pressure cooked after the set time and the minutes showed a reverse count down. The fifth time, there was no leak but the cooker still pressure cooked after the set minutes ( 20 min ) and the display time did the reverse count down again. I discovered this after it overcooked by 13 minutes and my food therefore became practically mush."
5.0 out of 5 stars,I love my instant pot. It's very safe. I like how it has a place for the lid to sit. I use it to cook dinner for my family as well as guest. I brag to my family and friends about almost everything I've cooked in my pot. The time it take to perfectly cook a dish is unbelievable I just love it! I bought two more for my daughters.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Purchased on Back Friday for 89.00 which is best price I have seen on Amazon.  Really cooks things fast.  Watch local sales!  Fred Meyer had on sale last week for 83.99 (8 qt.).  My favorite is Spaghetti squash ready in 4 minutes!  You do have to allow time for steam to build up, and also release, but  beats an hour in the oven!  Highly recommend..."
5.0 out of 5 stars,I am not the cook.  My neighbor and daughter in law both use this.  The food they have cooked is exceptional.  A roast in 70 minutes.  BBQ pork ribs 25 minutes. Both so tender. I just ask my daughter in law if she wanyed one of these for home.  She said an excited YES
5.0 out of 5 stars,"My favorite kitchen tool now! Especially I like high pressure cooking that reduces cooking time significantly. Those foods that would take so long to cook before - beans, beef, beats, making dolce de lecher - takes about 30-40 minutes now, plus you do not have to watch it and adjust anything. And there are so many other features! Absolutely love it and want buy one for my sister, but cannot find 220V, she lives in Europe."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This was the first croc pot type device I have purchased and I have had a great experience with it. The fact that it serves many uses is great for apartment living as I do not have the extra room to store various devices.From cooking rice, to heating stews and slow cooking roasts, this device works exceptionally well. The versatility of having a pressure cooking option is great when needing to quickly prepare a roast or anything else you would have otherwise slow cooked. The controls are simple and easy to understand. The accompanying documentation cover all of the uses of the device clearly and are easily read."
5.0 out of 5 stars,Most definitely pleased with the IPAF LID. Simple operation. Easy to use and clean. Have made some fantastic meals in it. Glad I was able to take my neglected IP off the shelf and use every day!
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I cook for two people, my husband and myself.  I chose the small Instant Pot because I thought it would fit my cooking needs and the room I have in my small kitchen.  I chose well!  I can cook smaller dishes for the two of us, (I don't like a lot of left-overs...my husband refuses to eat them) and the various functions help cut down on a kitchen full of appliances.  Love the Instant Pot and for my family...love this size!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,I have the 6 qt & the 8 Qt- I have to admit I was intimidated at first! But I took the advice to look up instructions on you tube! I learned so much on you tube videos.  I never bought a cookbook but the web has any recipe you could ask for! Some of my favorites are on Pinterest- my family loves the beef dip sandwiches. A 4 lb beef chuck roast is done in 75-80 minutes and it's delicious! Get the instant pot - you won't regret the purchase
5.0 out of 5 stars,I have all the instapot appliances blender air fryer an this bad boy 8qt it will cook a 3.5 lb roast in a lil over a hour from frozen. The 8qt is the biggest one an it’s good at what it does
4.0 out of 5 stars,Pressure Cooker feature works well but does take a bit to learn how to use.  Certain recipes need to cook down on low heat and this does not allow for that as it is sealed until the pressure can be released.Does a good job on tenderizing meat.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Have fallen in love with this appliance!  Saw it mentioned on Pinterest and Kitchn and did the research, it now is the most-used and star of our kitchen.  Glad we did not wait to order the 8qt.  Better more room for food than less.  Easy to clean, only wish is the stainless outer was a material like the black top.  Really tired of all the stainless steel craze.  My Ninja and digital crock pot lost first place to thr IP!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,I was hesitant to purchase this as I was afraid it would be another gadget in the pantry to collect dust.  But I love it! We are empty nesters and so crazy busy and this has helped me get back to actually making dinner after a long day.  Things that would normally take a lot of pre-planning and so much time have suddenly become accessible! I love it!
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love Instant Pots. This is my 2nd one, also owning a 6 qt. The only problem is that the condenser cup, rice paddle, rice measuring cup and soup spoon were not included. I’ve emailed the company and I hope they send them!  I’ve heard their customer support is quite responsive."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Now I know what all the hype is about. After a little trial and error, I’m getting pretty good at cooking with this thing. Best part is I can go on a 4-5 hour mountain bike ride and when I get back, I have a delicious hot meal waiting for me/us."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love my Instant Pot !  I'm still experimenting with it but so far, I've made Basmati rice, which came out great. I've done 2 beef roasts; the chuck roast came out much better than the bottom round. With the 2-3/4 lb chuck, I used 1-3/4 cups beef stock, browned the beef first on sauté, 1 chopped onion, set for High pressure for 45 minutes, quick release, added potatoes and carrots, resealed to High, set for 15 minutes, Quick release and it was mouthwatering. Meat tender and juicy, veggies cooked perfectly. Also have done 3 lb. pork butt.... Pulled pork was to die for !!  The silicone gasket does take on odors but I don't have much of a problem with that. I guess one could keep one or two gaskets on hand to change it out if that was undesirable. One slight problem I had was getting the gasket back in the track properly. There are specific videos on Instant Pot's YouTube channel that helped me immensely. I did another water test and all was fine. In the future, I do plan on purchasing a quality stovetop pressure cooker, probably larger, to use in the event I have no electricity. I do have a gas stove. But for now, I'm loving the Instant Pot and have to try more recipes. Great investment for beginners and experts alike !!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I’d been holding off n joining the Instant Pot craze, but with a busy new job with long hours healthy eating had fallen by the wayside. Decided to give it a try with a great Prime Day deal. I’m now completely hooked and don’t know how I ever lived without an Instant Pot. You need to be careful with venting (both making sure it’s turned off when starting to cook and when releasing pressure) but otherwise it’s easy-peasy."
1.0 out of 5 stars,"Instant pot randomly tripped the gfi outlet it was plugged into part way through the cooking cycle.  Ruined a difficult to replace pheasant dinner.  Gfi had never tripped before, installed 10 years ago as part of an electrical upgrade.  Google it, it is not just us.  It is being returned."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Wasn’t sure I was going to like this. I thought it was just like a crock pot which I hate. I tried a few recipes and they came out great. I made stuffed peppers, Chicken and rice, rice and beans, boiled peanuts, chicken and vegetables, etc. everything came out great. Easy to clean, just one pot , although I do see recipes that cook in the instant pot and then you have to cook in the oven also. I suppose if you want crispy food you have to do that, or just cook in the oven. ."

   This instant pot saved my life! The instructions are very easy to follow. Made my first ribs on this baby and its ooh ooh so good. The tender ribs were done under 30 minutes! 👍👍. Forgot to mentioned that I got this on prime day.. it was a steal!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"bought another one for my father! Easy to use. And even you don't know how to cook this pot is the right one for you! I love using this especially when i cook my favorite soups, stew, i can even use this for sauté."
3.0 out of 5 stars,"It seemed ok. But after use the pressure release valve would leak and spit liquid out all over the area around it. And no i didn't over fill it with liquid. Also i purchased the duo. There should be a tutorial or a better way to describe how it works. There was confusion about the settings on preparing food, confusing problems with the settings with the description of the buttons to push."
1.0 out of 5 stars,"Was super excited to receive mine, as it had been a few years since I had owned one. But, unfortunately mine was defective. The pot would never pressurize. I checked the seals and valves and all seemed okay. I tried my water test three times. First time, I aborted after 20 minutes. Second time I left it for 35 before aborting. The third time slightly longer and after removing the lid only a few tablespoons were left in the pot but the pot never pressurized, the float valve obviously never popped, and so the time never came on for the actually cooking portion of the process. Was pretty disappointed, and was even moreso when I called to have it replaced and Amazon advised they were not able to replace it and could only return my money. Which was fine, but preferred just replacing it. The issue with that, for all the first time returnees like myself..... they told me they don’t actually refund until the item is returned and “processed.” Also fine, until I asked how long does it take them to “process” the return in their warehouse. They told me approximately 2 weeks from beginning to end. I had to argue my point on having an issue of receiving a defective item, asking for a replacement NOT a refund, then being told they can’t replace it (reason not given but I assume out of stock) and then tell me that it’ll be a few weeks before it’s received, processed and the money returned on a defect. Uh, negatore, mis amigos."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"We have 3 regular pressure cookers at home and use them daily (to cook rice, lentils, etc).After we bought the Instant Pot, we stopped using the regular pressure cookers.We haven't used all the features of the Instant Pot yet, but we are very happy with it - its easy to use, it has a delay timer which is great(we can set the timer before going to work and stuff will be freshly made and ready when we come from work).We bought the 8Qt one and it allows us to stack multiple things in it so that we don't need to cook them separately."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Definitely a good product.  Priced fair. I especially like the good heavy stainless steel pot inside.  Cooks well and very simple to use.  I did purchase another pot different brand before this and paid more for it, exact same size but it can't compare to the Instant Pot. I would buy this again."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I use Instant Pot to make everything from beans to potato salad.  I’m not sure anymore what I would do without it! Although actual cooking time is fast, it does need extra time to get up to temperature and then again to de-pressurize, but the results are delicious without much mess to clean up, it’s all in one pot!  Love it as a slow cooker too!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,My wife had an initial difficult learning curve but now amazed me and our family with wonderful meals that she is proud to serve. I bought her one of the accessory kits which added a new world of dishes to try. Love it!
1.0 out of 5 stars,"I loved it for the first 3 uses. After that, this brand new Instant Pot only seals/pressurizes about every other time...and that's with trying to push down on side/top handles, opening and reclosing lid, trying the ""freeze the gasket"" trick, etc. VERY disappointed considering how expensive this was. When it works it's wonderful, but with this track record in less than a month of use, I'm forced to return this."
3.0 out of 5 stars,"It is good cooking tool, great alternative for oven top stove type....meals when recipes are followed and are well written gives you a fantastic dish with tender meat in a shorter time...hopefully it doesn't break and that i have to wait..Recommendation: make ot 120/240v capable and you have here an almost perfect item"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Bought during Prime Day and WOW, what a life changer! I've been trying to eat more whole foods and plant-based and this thing is a life-saver for making veggies and soups quickly. Also for preparing food for large numbers of guests. Super easy to figure out and use, even to a beginner and a not-so-experienced cook like me. Love that there is an entire online community and an app so I can find so many recipes. Still making new discoveries. Can't think what I did before having this pot! (Never thought I'd say that about a pot.)"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"So far there is nothing not to like about this instant pot.  Love the pressure cooker feature. Have a home cooked meal in minutes instead of hours. Saute, pressure cook, in minutes its done. Easiest thing to clean, nothing sticks, washes up with a little dish soap, no scrubbing or soaking necessary."
4.0 out of 5 stars,It's a handy kitchen tool. I have a separate pressure cooker (used on gas stove top) that I use for larger quantities but this one is handy for smaller meals. At times the recipe book condradicts the quick reference brochure so I would YouTube some of your dishes.
5.0 out of 5 stars,I love this product for it allows you to cook/prepare various dishes for dinner or parties that would normally take hours to create and cook.  I've used multiple times already and will continue to use frequently.  I will be gifting a couple of these to family members.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Every day is something new. The first time used was a little scary due to past “pressure cooker” stories, but this is a well designed machine that you can trust. So totally amazing what you can cook in it. Nothing has let us down. Quick. Delicious."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Works great, I would recommend searching the web for additional instructions and recipes. (For instance, you should not use the ""rice"" button to cook brown rice... Found a recipe that makes perfect brown rice in it though) I've used it as a crock pot, rice cooker and to saute things. It's nice to brown your meat in the outside before starting a crock pot recipe, you just throw the rest of the ingredients in. The inner pot is fairly light weight so if I need to lift out to drain something or whatever that is not an issue. (I can often do it one-handed) Overall I'm very pleased."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I'll just add my five star praises to the other rave reviews; the programmable Instant Pot IP-Duo60 7-in-1 is wonderful. I have tried all the features except for the yoghurt feature, and have to report happy results and no problems so far. I bought the pot to replace my aging crock pot and to have the pressure cooking feature so that I can quickly and easily prepare meals to go to take to my parents who still live at home and are in their nineties. There was a small learning curve for me, as I am coming from the older pressure cooking generation, but I would purchase again!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,Love it. I purchased this product just by watching my mom be able to cook so much dishes within minutes. I personally don’t have that much recipes to make so I still haven’t been able to see the full access of this product but it’s done a great job for the few dishes that I have made.
5.0 out of 5 stars,Love my Instant Pot. Can't believe I lived so many years without it.  I bought this one and a secura and this is my favorite because of the manual settings.  I also bought my daughter a Cuisinart and that is a great pressure cooker too. The only reason I would choose this one over the Cuisinart is the fact that it has a stainless steel bowl rather than the non stick of the Cuisinart.  The Cuisinart is only $99 thought so you have to decided what is more important to you... price or stainless steel.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have a 6 qt. one which I love so bought the smaller one for my daughter. I love that you can saute in it, then add the rest of your ingredients and viola! One pot meal, one pot to clean."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"We acquired this several months ago, after doing a bit of research on them, and we were well pleased with the results. We recently saw another brand with a ceramic coated bowl and a few accessories that this one did not have, so we got that one and gave this one to our son. Big mistake. Although this one takes a bit longer than that other one to build up steam, it appears the newer one does not build up as much pressure either.  Seriously considering buying another, just to have, as I'm suspicious of the newer one now.  It would be nice if they would make an 8 quart.  Maybe some day.Additional:  They have now made an 8 quart, which we got, and life is good. They made the pressure button easier to see. What I would like to see now is a way to start the pressure buildup ""manually"" with some sort of pump to get it sealed. Otherwise, if the steam being generated is insufficient as a function of time, you may never see the pot start to pressurize with some foods.  Instant Pot people, are you listening?"
5.0 out of 5 stars,Instant pot I love you. If I had a house fire you'd be the 2nd thing I'd grab. But seriously using your oven in the AZ summer sucks but this year I've used it twice thanks to this bad boy. There are tons of great groups on facebook for recipes and tips. My husband even said we needed a 2nd! If you're a busy working mom you need this in your life!!
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Instant Pot...how do I love thee? Let me count the ways! I bought this to make short work of bone broth. Now, I use it to make the most AMAZING yogurt, steam salmon and veggies - you name it. I honestly, thought I'd use it every couple of weeks for the broth alone. No way! It is SO versatile! I have it out on my counter because I use it several times per week. It is sleek and attractive, so it's not an eyesore and I just keep finding new ways to use it. Favorite purchase this year!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This pressure cooker is amazing. Very easy to use and clean. Just throw in the ingredients, push a few buttons and it does the rest. The results are quite tasty. It has many features that I haven't even tried yet, so it can only get better."
5.0 out of 5 stars,Love the IP 8Qts.  I use it daily.  Sips energy.  Set it and leave house.  I use it outdoors so doesn’t make airconditioner overwork.  Food turns out perfect and delicious.  Initially I was trying to return it because I thought the newer model version 3 shouldn’t have a red indicator.  Later found out the 3 generation does have the red indicator and initially came out with the 2nd generation 6 Qt IP sothe 2nd generation of the 8Qt using the 3rd generation sensors controllers etc...
5.0 out of 5 stars,"We have only used the Instant Pot a handful of times, but it has worked like a charm. It cooks so much better than a regular crock pot because of the ability to set it to stop cooking and only keep the food warm if you are going to be gone all day. My husband used the pressure cooker feature and really liked it - and it certainly made me less nervous than the old one we had that seemed ready to explode all the time. I'll be using it again tonight for a quick 2-hour cooking recipe while I'm at the gym - the versatility of this appliance is wonderful."
5.0 out of 5 stars,I love this appliance it has changed the way I cook. When I picked this for my b-day gift I never thought I would enjoy it this much. My first dish was beef stew and it was the best I have ever made or tasted.
5.0 out of 5 stars,This cooker is fast and easy to use. It is great for meats and cooks them super tender quickly. I like making the whole meal in one pot and clean up is easier too. It takes the place of a few separate appliances for me and saves me space on my limited countertops.
4.0 out of 5 stars,"Love it so far! Used it once to make fried chicken wings with out oil. Only used baking powder, pepper and seasonall. Only wish basket was bigger. Looking forward to trying other recipes. Easy to use and clean."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I researched this machine very well before purchasing and I have to say it is hands down one of the best appliances I have ever bought. I am able to make an entire gallon of yogurt in this machine for my family. PLUS it can make amazing beans from dry beans with no soaking required. I have made casseroles, slow cooker recipes, hard boiled eggs, and rice! This machine can easily replace different appliances people have in their kitchens. One of the best features to me is that it has a stainless steel insert. Everyone should have this machine, it totally saves you time and money!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,Obsessed with my insta pot. So easy to cook things and in half the time of a crockpot! Such a useful kitchen tool that I actually use multiple times a week if not every day.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Bought with trepidation. Biggest size, just me, but this is super product. So many uses. Easy! Safe! Versatile! I make a pot of soup every week. Everything is easy"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased this as a gift for my 30-ish year old daughter.  It's a lame Christmas present but it was practical and I knew it would come in handy for her.She is mental about this thing.  She's made about 10 meals in it after only a couple weeks.  I get regular texts with how awesome it is and accompanying food pictures.  Given all the praise, I'm thinking about buying one for myself."
5.0 out of 5 stars,I have used a pressure cooker before and like using them.  I found this to be superior to my other two.  It sounds a beep when the lid is close properly and when it is open.  The pan is very study and cleans very easily.  I made rice in 4 min. Meat browns very evenly.  I have only had it about 2 weeks and am still testing recipes.  The one thing that was important to me was that it was wide enough to fit my spring form pan so that I can make a cheese cake.  The recipe book is handy and if you can get other pressure cooker recipe books I would advise it until you know how to prepare things.  Time and liquid are very important!
5.0 out of 5 stars,"works great.  i love that it has stainless steal pot inside, and not the one with coating.  we used to have a coated pot before, and the coating slowly peels, and i am sure went into the food that we cooked. Absolutely love stainless steel, and will not use a coated product again.This pot has many settings and many buttons, and i need to sit down with a manual to figure out which setting to use.  I used the basic functions, and even though i am not technologically skilled, i turned it on and assembled it without any help.Very satisfied with this product overall."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"WOW! One of the best investments l have ever made in cookery! On my first attempt l discovered l had not added quite enough water to the IP and l got an error displaying ""burn"" l scanned the users manual and there was no reference to the error. A  quick google search said not to worry just add another cup of water and restart. I did that and it came out perfectly! Great device!!! Highly recommend"
5.0 out of 5 stars,Meat so tender makes you wanna slap your momma. Bought the bigger pot 8qt. No regrets. Did learn not to cook thick soups or gravy it will burn and has a safety burn feature as well. If your still using a crock pot its time to buy an instant pot
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I already have the IP DUO60 9-in-1 and have that top review for that product if you need more information than what's listed here.In that review I write a lot about my buying process and why I bought the IP over other brands.So, I've decided to stay with the IP line and bought the 3 quart. My Mom has 2 sets of real twins, so this is my version of twins.First, it was a great price on Black Friday. I tie up my 6 quart a lot with yogurt that takes 12 hours to make,then I put the inner pot in the fridge for a good 6+ hours. I also do a lot of batch cooking a couple of days a week,so I figured it warranted a 2nd pressure cooker and since it was on sell.....well, there you have it.It's probably not big enough to cook a chicken, but I can make my 2 quarts of yogurt in it and whatever sides.The 3 quart doesn't have as many preset buttons as the 6 quart.No multi-grain, sterilize, egg, bean/chili or cake but we know those are just presets.It's time that matters. The 3 quart  has the low and high pressure and less, normal and high.The two photos I've attached is the 6 and 3 quart side by side and the front of the 3 quart showing the preset buttons.I have the IP 3 quart for a lot of reasons I have the 6 quart. It's just a little smaller and now I can take it to Floridawhere we winter and it actually fits in one of my mobile home cabinets.It's a great addition to the ""family"".If you like my review, please click the helpful button here and on the IP DUO60 9-in-1 review. thanks."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I am single guy working all the day, so I don't have time to cook. Instant pot helped me much and shorten a long time of preparing food. I put the food inside and one click, you get a prepared your dish. Thanks for this inovative idea."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I cannot state enough how good this Pot is. I have two of them so I can cook few things simultaneously. Everything comes out perfect, starting with classical breakfast porridge, ending up with sophisticated beef recipes for Saturday family dinners.I am working mom and I think we would end up eating out much more often if I wouldnt have it.It feeds my family healthy meals and keeps me sane, relatively :)"
5.0 out of 5 stars,We use it 2 or 3 times a week. I was afraid to use my pressure cooker. Heard too many stories about them exploding. I'm not afraid of the Instant Pot at all and everything we've cooked in it has been delicious. The user You Tubes really helped too.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"We've cooked 6 meals in this already.  Everything cooks super fast and the many online resources for meal ideas make this a great addition to our kitchen.  Display is bright and easy to read and clean up is a snap.  This really is a fantastic way to cook meals quickly.  We have a crock pot as well, but I think it's going to be retired soon."
1.0 out of 5 stars,I like the fact that it is easy to clean. When it worked I made some very delicious soups. I used this maybe 6 times in a year and then I got the C6L error. This is a very expensive product to only last one year. I will not buy another one. Waiting to see if they are sending me a new unit since it is one month past the warranty?
5.0 out of 5 stars,So easy to use and easy to lift out. Unlike a crockpot we’re its so heavy I can’t take the ceramic pot out this one was a breeze. I’m using it every day I don’t have to wait all day or plan it out the night before. I bought one for my daughter an she loves it.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Life changing little machine. This is my second and love it 6qt as well. Lower costs of power, much quicker cooking (even frozen chicken), and love that it's one pot!! Cleaning is a breeze. I highly recommend to everyone. Get the app too when you do and also joint the Facebook page! Recipes galore!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,Waited for awhile to get one but this is the best machine so easy to use. I’ve only made one thing that didn’t turn out good. Found out from reading that it doesn’t do so well with soup concentrate or milk while cooking which I found out after the fact
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I used it twice so far, my only regret is that I didn't get the 3 qt one as I am cooking for only 2 people. It's easy to use, has nice sauteing feature and pressure cooking works well, in 6 minutes I managed to make a big pot of vegetables medley. Pretty impressed so far."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"So, I'm so late to the instant pot craze but this is my new favorite kitchen gadget. We use it every day! Seriously, it has replaced half my kitchen. We are a family of 5 and the 8 quart is perfect for some left overs or making for friends/family. It's pretty big but when you can put away multiple appliances because of this, that doesn't seem to matter. Absolutely love love love!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,Have wanted one of these for a long time! Got the 8 quart after doing research on what size i should buy. i have a large family so 8 quart was a must for me! So far i have cooked frozen chicken  and mashed potatoes! both turned out perfect and only took 15 to 20 minutes! Make sure you read instructions and i highly recommend searching online for tips and recipies as it does have s little bit of a learning curve! Cant wait to do beans!
4.0 out of 5 stars,"Waiting to hear back from Instantpot company.....The first one I ordered didn't work at all so Amazon graciously said return it and sent me another.....been loving it for about 2 months and then last night, one minute it was working and then it wasn't....so now I've contacted I've contacted ""support"" at Instant Pot......see how this goestook several days; but heard back from customer support and back in business....change my star rating"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is, hands down, my favorite kitchen device to use.  It is versatile, easy to use, easy to clean, and so handy.  I use it almost every night to cook for my family of 5.  It has me cooking again and saves so much time.  As a working mom, ease and convenience is important and this has both.  I'm able to fix healthy meals for my family without spending hours in the kitchen.  So glad I was introduced to this!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I was looking for a replacement for my old Slow Cooker. I am so happy with this appliance! One day I decided to test it, so I made stew in my little slow cooker and put the exact same ingredients into the Instant Pot.  I cooked the Instant Pot stew for 35 minutes and ran the slow cooker for 5 hours.  They both tasted the same BUT the meat in the Instant Pot batch was SO TENDER! I will never use my slow cooker for anything but keeping things warm for holiday buffet again!  The stainless steel cooking vessel is so easy to clean.  This is a must-have for any kitchen!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I really like everything about this (including that I got an amazing deal on it during Black Friday!)! It is beautiful, easy to use and clean. I was a little intimidated at first because of all of the buttons, but between the included instructions and all the online help it’s been very learnable. I’ve mostly only used it to cook sweet potatoes or oatmeal so far, but even that has made it worth it! I can just set it and forget about it until it’s done. And cooked perfectly every time."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I am absolutely amazed by this product.  I have seen others post how wonderful and thought they were being dramatic.  Nope!  I love it!  I haven't even explored the many possibilities yet, but I certainly plan to!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,This is 3rd generation design shows that Instant Pot listens to their customers. The stainless steel inner pot is a great thing esp. if you need to brown your meat. If I had known about this product 5 years ago I would have bought it instead of that Teflon shedding Cuisinart.I tend to use manual settings rather than built-in programs and this unit gives me more temperature control options. You can produce some serious competition chili in this pot.Hmmm... St. Patty's Day is coming up. I wonder what this will do to Kobe corned beef and beer...
4.0 out of 5 stars,"I was in the market for a new crockpot after mine broke.  A friend recently posted they wanted this one, so I took a look at it.  I love all the features it has.  I was torn between this one and the 6-in-1, but eventually decided on this one.  I've never made yogurt before, but who knows.  I might now.  We are still getting used to the functions on it.  It seems like the low temperature for the slow cook feature is a lot lower temperature than my old crockpot.  It seems like high slow cook is the way to go.  My husbands favorite feature is the pressure cooker.  It cooks food fast and it's full of flavor.  I can't wait to try the rest of the feature."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have wanted one of these for years and finally received one as a Christmas gift. It works amazing. I love the Egg function for hard boiling eggs. Also, while I can cook most dishes other ways, I love how hands off it is. I can get the prep dishes done and play with my kids while dinner is cooking. I am definitely an Instant Pot believer."
5.0 out of 5 stars,I have another model in a condo I own. It has more settings but this is fine for my needs.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This thing is huge compared to what i was expecting, pleasant suprise. I LOVE how simple it is to use once you get the initial learning curve down. First thing I made was potatoes followed by rice......was too easy. Tasted better and was suprisingly quicker than regular stove top with less paying attention!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love it.  I don't ask it to do half of the fancy stuff it claims that it can do but it it's a great pressure cooker.  I've had it in use for over a year now. Buttons are color coded and easy to use.  The lid holder, although a bit difficult to get used to, works great.  It makes great bean chili and all sorts of dark meat chicken recipes.Complaints:  I wish I could mute the the beeping.  It beeps before it starts and it beeps when the cooking is finished as it turns to a keep warm setting."
1.0 out of 5 stars,Has to be the biggest piece of garbage I have ever bought . I put a rack inside to cook chicken pieces so they are somewhat crispy all it says is burn . After 40 min still cold. If this is only for soups and casseroles then that’s great . Way overpriced . Returning
5.0 out of 5 stars,"At first I was intimidated by it.. I'd never used a pressure cooker before and had visions of explosions based on a bad experience my mother in law once had... but this is not your grandmothers pressure cooker... I have grown to love it the more I use it and realize all the things I can do with it.. and how quickly.. which includes cooking frozen meat that I forgot to defrost... I now leave it out on the counter where I can see it as I am an ""out of sight out of mind"" person.. This I want to use as often as I can."
5.0 out of 5 stars,I have yet to make anything in this that has not been fabulous.
5.0 out of 5 stars,Okay so we are a bit nuts when it comes to these things. We have 3. This is the first 8 Qt but it adds a few things.ProsThe size is great.Everything we cooked came out perfect.Cooks at a higher preassure option than our 6 QtConsNow it makes my 6 Qt units see outdated.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"The hype is real!  A must for busy working moms who want to create delicious foods  with little time in the day.  I love how easy it is to use and especially how easy it is to clean!  Changed the way I cook and more importantly, how frequently I actually cook!  You can find excellent recipes online and on YouTube if you need ideas.  I love this so much I am considering getting a bigger one, or buy a second one."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Purchased this smaller model for use in our RV. Tried it at home first, and performed flawlessly. Compact enough for travel, and quick enough to not be slaving over a grill or oven when out in the beautiful outdoors. It will make some impressive potluck dishes, quick and easy. Lots of cooking styles and p=options with this model."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Used a stove pressure cooker before and was not sure if an electric one will be something we like. How wrong we were! We used it to make soups (perfect chicken broth which is impossible to do on the gas stove) and yogurt (in the quart jars). I love how easy it is to cook in this pressure cooker. Basically it is just set it and forget it. One thing don't like is the lid, which caches the smells. I believe it's silicone ring. Fortunately yogurt did not taste like chicken. I love our new addition to the kitchen - with the amount of cooking we do (practically every day) this is a very handy tool. I can't wait until we try some other recipes!"
4.0 out of 5 stars,The instructions provided on its use are minimal. To make yogurt I had to watch a you tube video because you don’t just hit the yogurt button. Takes a lot of experimentation and preservance but works well. The yogurt was very good.  I have heard of many people who use it once and not again. I think it’s a learning curve.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Yes! Yes! Yes!!!! It is amazing! I use it at least three times a week. When I don't know what to make for dinner, I google the meat I have plus instant pot and choose a recipe! I used it twice today! Love! Love! Love! I save the recipes I find to my notes and I am ready to use again!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,I own three instant pots. My husband had a heart attack and now I meal prep for him.
5.0 out of 5 stars,This air fryer saves so much time cooking. It makes food taste so much better and is so much healthier for you. Love the taste! You use little to no oil when you air fry.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I LOVE this pressure cooker! I tried the XL from TV and that thing was a cheap piece of garbage with a Teflon inner pot. Teflon poisons your food. This Instant Pot has a stainless steel inner pot and it is well constructed and well worth the price. I’ve used it several times and it does everything it is supposed to do. I’ve made chili, seafood and chicken in record time and everything tasted amazing."
1.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought this Instant Pot as a gift to myself and I opened the box this morning to start prepping for our upcoming New Years dinner. The Instant Pot in the box was used. There are fingerprints and smears on the lid, water spots on the inside and the mini guide was obviously used. If I knowingly bought a used item, that would be one thing, but I paid full price for a brand new item and I got a used product. So people check your purchases. I will return this and I will be using my old reliable Cuisinart today, it is smaller but at least I know I am the only one who has used it."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought this a while ago and was so intimidated to use it, but it’s so much easier than what I thought. It makes the juiciest and most tender meat I’ve ever had in TEN MINUTES!!I am constantly forgetting to unthaw meat for dinner, but with my instapot it doesn’t matter. Meat can go from freezer to instapot to table in less than a half an hour.One thing to note- always add at least a cup of water (or other liquid) no matter what you’re cooking. It’s so versatile and you can literally make anything!!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,Ever since I used this Instapot I have not used my stove. This instapot is so worth it. Since I have bought this I have not went to fast food and for me that’s my biggest accomplishment. Cooking in this has been so easy
5.0 out of 5 stars,"We love the Instant Pot! I got one for Christmas last year and I have been using them for gifts for everyone I can think of ever since. This has replaced so many other gadgets in my kitchen, and the fact that foods can be cooked so quickly makes weeknights so much easier for this teacher, grad student, and mom of young boys!In the last year, the number of awesome food bloggers using and creating recipes for the Instant Pot has skyrocketed and that's made using this bad boy even easier [and tastier!]. I wish I were getting a kick-back from this company for as much as I gush about it to anyone who will listen, but it really has been a game-changer, lol. As a busy lady, I know I appreciate any time I can get the inside scoop on something that's going to make my life easier or more efficient, so I guess this is me, paying it forward. :)"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"The Instapot air-fryer lid is exactly what it’s supposed to be, an air-fryer conversion for your Instapot pressure cooker. It’s easy to use, cooks efficiently and cleanly, using little to no oil, just a quick spray of cooking oil. If you are trying to reduce your fat intake and/or trying to eating healthier, the Instapot air-fryer is for you. Enjoy! (Tip: Be sure your Instapot pressure cooker model will be compatible with the air-fryer lid. Check the specs.)"
5.0 out of 5 stars,Love this thing but it is heavy.  We ended up buying the smaller one too. Now I can cook rice and another dish at same time.  I highly recommend getting the glass slow cooker lids to go with them. We use this thing for cooking all the time and have gotten rid of our slow cookers too.  There are bunches of Youtube video recipes for the instant pot. We have way more variety in our meals now.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought for my niece since she loved the one I bought for my daughter.Pros:  sleek and clean design,  multi-function, sizeCons:  found at target for about $40.00 less after I had wrapped it for Christmas."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"It took me a while before I was willing to jump on the instant pot bandwagon but so far so good. I bought this on a Black Friday special and saved about 30 bucks from the lowest price we had locally. I do use this mostly for making bone broth because it’s a lot nicer to do in four or five hours than two days! I can definitely see advantages for soups, stews, and meats."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"My husband and I love this Instant Pot.Last night I cooked a vegetable pasta in it with seasoning, then added 2 brats and carrots to it. My husband loved it. We have owned it now for one year. Thank you Canada"

5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have wanted an Instant Pot for a long time, and finally got a deal I couldn’t refuse. I couldn’t be happier with my Instant Pot ... it’s very well built and easy to use. I have been finding ways to use it every day ... the first thing I made in mine was a cheesecake, after reading that the first thing many people make in their Instant Pot was cheesecake! Who knew that you could make a cheesecake in a pressure cooker?!!!"
2.0 out of 5 stars,"I havnt been able to try it out..Recieved this yesterday and was very excited to try it out except it came with no manual or guide. No papers. Just a tag saying to refer to manual before use.. On the box it references all it comes with, a manual and safety guide are to be included... Now I've got this big instant pot and nothing cooking.. It's disappointing."
1.0 out of 5 stars,I am highly peeved that the second time I tried to use the pot the power buttons would not work no matter what I did.  I am also not happy about having to buy a ton of accessories in order to use the pot.  I have placed a return request today and am wondering whether or not I want to try another one.
5.0 out of 5 stars,A gift for my daughter in-law and she LOVES it.  I gave it as an early Xmas gift since she was cooking thanksgiving dinner and she has used it everyday since - including making yogurt for my baby granddaughter.  Best use of a gift I have ever given!!
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've had this about a month now.  I talk about it so much that several of my co workers have now purchased one too!  I think there is a learning curve with any pressure cooker, and this one is no exception.  Some items (like bone broth) turn out exceptional, far better results than I have ever gotten with a slow cooker or stove.  Other things, like vegetables - I'm still working with so they aren't overcooked.  I haven't used all the functions, and haven't made rice, so can't comment on all of the features.  I really like it so far, and it cleans up nicely."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love it. Way more helpful than a crockpot. Yes, it can be frustrating with how long it takes for the instantpot to heat up and build pressure, but you shove that food in there and forget about it for a while. This is great for me, where I have no patience for traditional cooking but a crockpot takes too long."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"don't be fooled by knock offs, there have been a lot of issues with other brands exploding and causing injury.  I paid a little more for the name brand, original Instant pot.  My wife loves it.  Cooks quality meals in less time.  Love the features!  Easy to use.  Getting rid of several of our small appliances!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,I have used the instapot to make three different things so far.  it is so easy to use.  at first I was intimidated by it but decided to try the water test and when I found how easy it was.  I use it quite often.  more than when I had a pressure cooker that I used on the stove. I have had no issues. It makes making your food so much quicker.
1.0 out of 5 stars,Just opened it today and I was sent a used pot. The box is big and heavy and I don’t have time to do exchange or return. Unhappy with the purchase but will live with it if it works. I’m trying it out today.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Been hearing about all the hub bub on these. Our fire station got one and everyone loves cooking chicken, veggies and potatoes all in one pot and it being done in less than an hour. I used the slow cooker twice and since then gave my old Crock pot too my daughter to save on room in my cabinet."
1.0 out of 5 stars,"This did NOT come with a cord to plug it into the wall, that also needs to be plugged into the back of the pot! I would NOT recommend spending $130.00 on this pot only to have to spend more in order to get it working."
5.0 out of 5 stars,This is my 2nd instant pot since with only one at home you can’t whip two recipes up at the same time.  Wish I had bought the 10qt since you can cook less with a bigger pot but you can’t cook more with a smaller pot.
5.0 out of 5 stars,now where to store it? lol
2.0 out of 5 stars,We were very happy with it while it lasted. Bought in August of 2019 broke in late Nov 2019. Device just would not heat up in spite of controls been Ok. Emailed customer service and 4 wks later still no response.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"My wife loves this. There is, as I am learning, a 'cult' of instant pot users.  They use it for everything.  She is having a great time experimenting. Caution #1 is that it is noisy, a by-product of its pressure cooking function.  Caution #2 is that hardcore foodies will be disappointed - you really can't speed up the cooking process without some slight loss of flavor and consistency."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"My first time using this I decided to pull a recipe out of the manual that came with it, since it had specific instructions on the buttons and time, what to do and when.  The dish turned out perfectly using the times and settings indicated.  It is way better than my last pressure cooker, the vent release is easy to use, as is removing and storing the lid.  I love the saute feature for browning meat, and reducing sauce.  It was even easy to clean up when done.  I think this will be my new go to device for quickly cooking delicious and tender meals."
5.0 out of 5 stars,I have not bought a second Instant pot as I use it for yogurt on a regular basis and have made quick easy and delicious meals in one pot that my family love and takes me so little time and effort to prepare and only one pot to clean when done.  Wish I had bought is sooner.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love how the food turns out better than traditional cooking and in a fraction of time. This literally can make a dinner in 30 minutes that would have taken hours and hours in the oven or slow cooker. It does meats, veggies eggs just perfectly! I would definitely tell people to get this size it is perfect if you are making enough for a family."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I meant to place a review for this size but mistakenly left one for 5qt pot, so here I go again..... (Please see the 5qt review for the photos)I was seriously starting to thinking of getting this pot when I found the amazing deal at the Black Friday sale this past November, 2015. Unfortunately I missed the best deal (below $90! I waited too long) but next time it popped out with a reasonable price, I jumped on it and I am happy I did. Since the time of purchase, I use this pot almost every day. I love using it that much! My husband agrees, too, that this is THE BEST and most used kitchen appliance so far. The results are very nice each time. I just need to find the best fitting cooking time for leafy vegetables like bok choy and nappa cabbage.I ordered three pressure cooker recipe books from Amazon Japan for more recipes for Japanese dishes. Love, love, love this Instant Pot!"
1.0 out of 5 stars,"My new Instant Pot stopped working several months ago.  Since then, I have repeatedly tried to reach out to the company for support - with absolutely no success.  I loved my IP while it was working, but if you buy one, you're ON YOUR OWN from that point forward."
1.0 out of 5 stars,"8 months of using the instant pot and something is wrong with the pressure cooker. I called and no one picks up the phone. Sent and email and after a month no response. I finally get someone on the phone after almost 3 months of trying , and they’re giving me a hard time to replace the top part... sucks, doesn’t last long, and then they don’t want to help you fix it."
1.0 out of 5 stars,"I loved this thing. I took great care of it. Less than a year later, not working."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"High quality. Works great. Easy clean up. Only gripe is it's a bit on the small side, but nice not to have another full sized appliance taking up space."
1.0 out of 5 stars,Item was great ... until it kept registering “burn” and I noticed side near seam was MELTED. Fire hazard and company keeps asking for more information after losing information and it is under one year warranty. Buyer beware.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought this instant pot for my girlfriend, she seen it on Amazon and really liked the many settings and ease of use.Since getting it she enjoys cooking fast & healthy meals. Great buy."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought this on Black Friday and I have used it at least 2x a week!Food is delicious and it's so easy to use!I have to say the pressure cooker is in bw a rice cooker and a slow cooker.I love how quick everything cooks perfectly! (meat is super tender, stews are done perfectly, you can make congee, the variety of what you can cook is endless... even yogurt!)This is a MUST HAVE, must buy! So simple my husband uses it and he's not a kitchen person."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is a great addition to any kitchen. I general spend on day on the weekend ""prepping"" food for the week so I don't have to spend too much time in the kitchen after work. Having an Instant Pot makes having to cook on a busy week night so easy. Pot roast or a whole roaster chicken prepped and cooked in about 45 minutes. Some people are nervous around a pressure cooker but the Instant Pot is not only programmable but also has many safety features to prevent mistakes or accidents. Read and follow the directions - you will be fine!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"When I first say the Instant Pot I though, ""Another silly TV gadget.""  Maybe, but there's a reason the Instant Pot has an almost cu;t-like following.  What's not to like?  delicious one-pot meals in a hurry using pressure, or simmered slowly if that's what's wanted.  You can cook perfect rice.  Like chewy steel-cut oatmeal?  Couldn't be easier!  Not a uni-tasker: Having this will free up a lot of cupboard space for you."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love this very much!! The best pot for stew or soup. I am the person who alway over cooked, lol. So this is the perfect applicance for me too cook, because I don’t have to watch the fire and stuffs."
5.0 out of 5 stars,I’m in love with this instant pot! It cooks all my rice to perfection. It is very easy to clean. A small note though: it does have loud beeping to indicate when it’s finished and at different stages of cooking. But it does it’s job well and I hope it lasts for years.
4.0 out of 5 stars,"Really awesome product. Super versatile and the amount of time saved really helps with schedules and efficiency. The inside stainless steel pot is easy to clean but we do have some staining inside unless we let is soak and fully scrub. The timing for cooking settings in the recipe book as been more of a guide. We adjust based on our regular products used for specific rices, beans, etc. I feel like there is so much untapped potential. Makes me want to be in the kitchen and cook more!"
4.0 out of 5 stars,"Loved everything about it! First meal of beef stew was just a 35 minute test run... First time using such a product... came out great! I didn't see any demos or anything, I threw everything in the pot, basically stacking everything up bottom to top, according to what needed most cook time, to the least cook time!"
3.0 out of 5 stars,Not my cup of tea. Exactly as described. But at the end of it. It doesn't really seem easier to use. So many more steps involved than just using my crock pot or mirro pressure cooker. And this thing is bulky and heavy. I'll stay old school.
5.0 out of 5 stars,Works just as others have reported. Makes pressure cooking easy! Have tried several recipes and all have come out splendid! Saute works very well. Very easy to clean! Only thing less than excellent is the rack that is included does not work well for steaming vegetables such as green beans or sliced carrots. I scavenged the trivet from our manual pressure cooker to use with these. Will likely order an aftermarket rack or trivet that is more suitable. Will likely order a an additional Instant Pot stainless bowl to make it easier to prepare multiple dishes for one meal.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Have had this for a year and use it quite frequently.  Since there are 25,000 reviews - I won't regurgitate tech specs and such.Simply put, this works great and the variety of food you can make - killer.  Fast, too.Be warned - once you start getting into this you will find that Pinterest and Facebook groups can consume hours and days of your year. It is almost cult-like ;)Enjoy and happy eating!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is one appliance that will change your life. Really, it will. I love the thing. I have used is more than one time a day every day since I got it. I have even made yogurt in it. What I really love is that it does not heat my house up. Living in Arizona where it is forecast to be 120 degrees today, I appreciate anything that keeps my house cool while I cook. I also love that I can put off cooking dinner to that last minute and still have a complete meal ready in no time. I have told all my friends that they need an Instant Pot."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"I have used it several times already and cannot be happier with all the results of each dish I've made so far. I know they say the rubber gasket in the lid can trap odors. They weren't joking. That's really the only downside to this product. It is removable and can be soaked to reduce the smell, but the more you remove it the more chance it has to lose shape. I guess that's why they sell it as a spare part. Otherwise this thing would have gotten a full 5 stars."
1.0 out of 5 stars,"I had this for a few weeks and it was working.I had the same level of water with chicken and hit the 'soup broth'  button.This time it showed a burnt instead of the normal 'OFF"""
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've now used it twice. I'm am impressed ! It is so easy and quick. First thing I cooked (sausage & cabbage, added onion, potatoes carrots and bacon) 12-15 pressure up time and 15 cook time. So, so simple and house smells yummy . 2nd time of use I played with saute feature for onion and bacon, blackeyed peas were excellent, perfect!  12-15 pressure up and 25 cook time. Recipes online... Love this !!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,I should have bought one of these when they first came out. This pot is truly all in one and cleanup is a breeze. I'm constantly surfing the internet in search of more recipes just so my family gets the very best out of this pot. I've already bought several accessories for this pot and we use it almost daily. What more can I say? This pot rocks!
5.0 out of 5 stars,I love how quickly and fast I can make all my food! It was scary to use at first so I would recommend watching a couple of YouTube videos on how to use it and doing a water test to get rid of the smell of plastic. (It disappeared after the water test)It’s super easy to use and great for huge meal prep!
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I just bought my second pot, not as a replacement, but so I can use 2 at once. I have adopted a starch based whole food vegan diet and was getting tired of babysitting pots on the stove to cook potatoes rice quinoa etc. Now I just add the food and water, set the timer, walk away, and it comes out better than anything I was doing before. Sweet potatoes are awesome in here, fast and more moist than baked. I stopped buying canned black beans because I can go from dry in the bag to eating them fresh cooked in a little over an hour. For steaming broccoli or asparagus, where not turning things to mush is important, I still prefer to babysit a pan on the stove though."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"Made amazing corn chowder using the husks... and no cream of half and half needed. Excellent flavor.Easy to use... as always new appliances have to be learned meal by meal.Update - foods can easily burn when  the sauteing - there is no temp control. So I am updating to 4 stars...I can deal with this easily, now that I know it, by turning if off to lower the temp and then on to raise it.A little hassle - but for the price - not a big deal.GREAT chicken Mole...Get the ATK pressure cooker cook book!"
1.0 out of 5 stars,"The air fryer did not work. It heated up a little but did not cook the food. The food at the top, closest to the heating coil was lukewarm after following the recipe heating time and the food at the bottom of the air fryer pot was still cold. Super disappointed!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,Does everything you expect plus some!!! Love it! Easy to use and easy to clean.
5.0 out of 5 stars,This is a time and money saver.  You would be able to find endless instantpot cooking videos from youtube.Instantpot helps me to meal prep for days.  Stay lean and mean ^_^**I've bought this item on Cyber Monday and it cost me $69.99.  I've also purchased a 4-year warranty.  Great deal!
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I was looking to replace a slow cooker that had stopped working and came upon this.  I am all for appliances that can do more than one thing as long as they can do it well.  I hadn't done much with pressure cooking and was very skeptical when I purchased it.  The first one that arrived was DOA, I began to wonder if I had made a mistake.  The replacement arrived and I began to use it.  In the last few months, this has become the most used appliance in my kitchen.  I am amazed with being able to cook ribs and pulled BBQ in less than an hour, I can make soup and stocks without having to babysit them all afternoon, I have used it as a rice cooker and steamer.  The only thing I haven' tried is yogurt.Definitely worth the price"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I struggled over spending money on something I wasn't sure I would use that much.  I've had my Instant Pot about 5 weeks now, I think.  I am impressed.  My most often cooked meal has been a Pot roast.  I also love making rice in it.  So far, so good.  I am impressed and happy I decided to make the purchase.  I plan to search for more recipes to enjoy!!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have used the pressure cooker several times, for butternut squash soup (nom nom nom), lentil soup, and several one-pot chicken meals and it performed beautifully.  It is excellent for cooking beans from dried (I don't soak, and that works very well) and if I only ever used it for that purpose, it would still be an excellent purchase.  I am learning where I can make changes to recipes and where I must adhere to the IP instructions for safety's sake.  It is so much safer than my old jiggler pot.Also, cleanup goes pretty quickly.  The stainless steel pot is easy to wash, and the lid and sealing ring are easily cleaned and dried and put away.I have not yet made yogurt but plan to do that soon.  I bought the glass lid (separately) for that purpose, on a friend's recommendation.  I am thrilled with the IP!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love everything about my instant pot! I now own three of them. A 3 qt, 6 qt and now the 8 qt. Each of them have there own use and we are eating at home more and more. I’ve made yogurt in the 8 qt and it was wonderful!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"My favorite new kitchen appliance.  Between this and my air fryer you practically can cook everything.  I love that you can sear meat and then pressure cook it rather that dirty another pan searing and adding to a crock pot. I have already given out many as gifts.  It’s the perfect wedding, new baby, and off to college gift!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought this as a gift for my daughter. She has had it for about four months now and absolutely loves it. She has cooked our family favorites, but also tried new recipes. She loves how much time it saves her after work to make a fantastic, healthy meal, and usually reduces the number of dishes to do when dinner is over."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"As it was bought in the ""warehouse deals"" it indeed had a nice bang in the back, justifying the reasonable discount from the original price. It works perfectly and offer tremendous versatility and speed to any cooking endeavor. I LOVE it and CAN't wait to discover everything that I can do with it. I may buy another one, perhaps smaller. The only thing I do not love so far, is the very bright LED controls that light up my kitchen at night. I hope this is not detrimental to the food."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I use this pot for daily meal preparation. So far I’ve used for sauté, pressure cooking, meat/stew preparation & it worked perfectly. Now I don’t have to spent hours next to hot stove or worry about cleaning spills / pots. I am able to prepare curry, soup, biryani in instant pot without having to make any change in the recipe."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I really like my instant pot.  I have actually purchased this as a second pot so I can cook a complete dinner in one shot.  I have mostly used the pressure cooker option.  The slow cooker option has 3 settings, I am still trying to figure out which one is best since my crockpot had only 2.  I also used the yogurt feature, my yogurt was not thick and that could have been due to the lack of whole milk but also the preset is for 8 hours.  Love the stainless steel pot!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love it so much I want a second one. Easy to use. Has a safety feature that if you ""burn"" something, it shuts off. Easy clean. Minimal space taken up. Ever since I got this, donated my crock pots. I suggest getting a few inserts and a few silicon lids. Easy meal prep, storage, cooking.... love love love it. I make bone broth weekly. Easy. Peasy."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"Nice pressure cooker that saves a bunch of time. Intuitive to use and relatively easy to clean. 3 stars on the ease to clean because the o-ring holds onto odors and that can affect your food. Kinda gross, mine still smells like quinoa... its been 4 weeks"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is the 7th instant pot that I am buying. The last 6 were gifts. This time it was a great deal as well for thanks giving. I have been an instant pot user since that last 4 years. I keep recommending or gifting this product my friends and family. I use it everyday for Indian cooking mostly. I mostly use it to cook all types of curries, lentils, beans, porridge, all types of meats(cooks quickly and very tender). (Garnazo beans comes perfect).Everything keeps its proper shape without getting mushy.The best part is that I don't have wait for the whistles. I used to spend money on traditional cookers from India which cost almost the same as these. It was hard to find accessories then. Cooking is simple now with Instant pot."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Had it for a little over a year, then it didn't seal properly, boiled over and won't turn on again.  Presumably the boil over messed up the electronic panel.  The company replaced it at no charge."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"My first foray into the world of Instant Pot was about a year ago.  I got the smallest size (at that time a 5qt) available. I needed a bigger pot.  WOW!  I could sell this product. I use it many times a day from steaming fresh vegetables to cooking a duck to chili.  ONE POT COOKING. Yep, it's the best for me."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love this thing! I've made so many different meals with it. I love the safety features and can cook while taking care of other tasks. I made ribs, soup, turkey, stock, casseroles, and everything else."
5.0 out of 5 stars,Instant Pot is my go to cooking method.  Very easy to use and everything tastes delicious.  I would recommend getting extra silicone sealing rings. Because a) after about a year they wear out and b) they can take on smells so you if you make things like deserts you will want a separate ring for those.  Also the silicone lid I bought was very helpful to store leftovers in the pot.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased this for the Wife.  She simply loves it.  She has fixed dinners in no time at all.  The flavors are great, it comes apart easy for cleaning.  Even though parts are machine washable, she washes by hand just the same.  Now we are thinking about a Air Fryer.  Totally recommend this Pressure Cooke to all that love to cook."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is a great pressure cooker. I love that it can do so many different things. I'm looking forward to trying out the yogurt function. If you're wanting to can meats, etc that's not recommended with this Insta Pot. Though they do say you may can things that are safe to use the boil canning method. It is also great for cooking meals quicker and leaves them nice and juicy. It also does a great job cooking rice. I  haven't had it long but I'm so looking forward to using this a lot more in the future."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"my wife is a cook, no way other way to say it. She loves cooking, she loves the gadgets. The Instant Pot is her favorite new kitchen tool in years. Its been used on regular weekly rotation since weve had it, and my wife has commented many times how much she cooking with it."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"LOVE my Instant Pot! We've used it 2-4 times a week since we got it and I can't see us slowing down anytime soon. I've always been nervous about using traditional stove top pressure cookers, but I feel this pot is very safe and it's no where near as scary. There are several Instant Pot Facebook groups that share all kinds of recipes and tips, which have really helped us get the most out of our pot and find lots of recipes. The Instant Pot allows me to cook homemade meals for my family without sacrificing much time spent with them in the evenings after work, which is the best part for me. Not having to babysit a pot on the stove is awesome, and clean up is a breeze! Highly recommend!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This has replaced my rice cooker, my pressure cooker and my slow cooker.Amazing Rice everytimeThe Saute Function is absolutely Dreamy.  Saute to your hearts content and then de-glaze with a liquid of your choice and capture all the amazing flavor.Pressure cooker quick release isn't terrifying like the old pressure cookers.It's safe and runs rock solid everytime!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Bought this for my wife for Mother's Day and I use this more than she does! Pulled pork, pasta, frozen steak, frozen chicken, it doesn't matter, this thing will cook anything. Plenty of reliable recipes online for this Instant Pot. Purchased the 6 QT for my wife and I with 2 small children and it has enough food for one night of leftovers. A must have!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"We made our first recipe in it last night and it was everything promised.  It truly is just like a super fast crock pot.  Simply throw in your ingredients, set the time and mode accordingly, and in a short time you have a deliciously tender meal! The interior pot is light weight and extremely easy to remove and clean, and all accessories fit right inside for storage. I look forward to using this again!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"The minute I took this out of the box, I could tell it was a quality product.  It's solid throughout.  The stainless steel pot insert is even heavy.  I have cooked with a pressure cooker for years and they are loud and sometimes messy.  Don't get me wrong, I still love cooking in pressure cookers. But I could not even tell this cooker was running it was so quiet.  I kept going into the kitchen to see if it was even running. The clean up was easy and the first meal tasted great.  I can now put the meal in and leave my pressure cooker to do it's job.  I don't have to stay around to shut off the heat.  I am loving this thing.  The next meal is a pot roast."
5.0 out of 5 stars,excelente inversión aunque aun estoy aprendiendo a usarla
5.0 out of 5 stars,I'm Appalled by the fact that the item shipped in its original box! Someone could just come up and steal what I paid for! It shouldn't be allowed to be shipped like that! Happy with product! But if u order this I recommend staying home all day to ensure the safety of ur order
5.0 out of 5 stars,I was a little intimidated to use a pressure cooker.  This is absolutely easy to use ( you just have to read the directions!)  I recommend getting a cookbook for Instant Pot recipes.  I have found a lot of my favorite recipes converted into pressure cooking. Minor tweeks to the recipes.  I love that I can make bone broth in 30 mins and not stink up my house for 2 days in the crockpot.  I have prepared several meals for the week in one afternoon that would have taken my crockpot hours to cook one meal. It does serve as a crockpot as well.  I love that I can sauté my veggies before I put in the meat.  Well worth the money.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have always been afraid of the type of pressure cooker used directly on the stove top after my aunt blew up her kitchen canning red beets.  That was NOT a good day...I feel this pot seems safer for the inexperienced like me.  I have used it 3 times in the past 2 weeks and each time it has worked perfectly and the food is absolutely divine. I am using recipes from Miss Vickie's Big Book of Pressure Cooker Recipes purchased here on Amazon.  Excellent book with tons of practical recipes and tips, highly recommend you buy the book and this pot together.  A with 20 +s!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Pressure cooking is my ""go to"" method to get good meals quickly, especially in the winter. I've been using stove top pressure cookers for 40 years. This is my first electric, multi purpose pressure cooker. My gosh - why did I wait so long?!?  I am sooo happy with this cooker. It's a manageable size, not heavy, it's quiet and easy to clean.I would recommend this to a beginner or someone wanting to expand their cooking options."
5.0 out of 5 stars,Love...use nearly every day.
2.0 out of 5 stars,"Overrated. I have not seen anyone mention this....despite what is advertised about Instapot, all dishes should NOT be cooked under pressure. The taste isn't authentic Finally realized I dont enjoy pressure cooked meals."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"One of my favorite purchases of the last couple of years. I've been making baby back ribs in here like there's no tomorrow. Also have made eggs, dessert custard, soup.... all of which have turned out AMAZING. I'm not great in the kitchen, but I love this product and everything I've made so far has been great. I bought one for my parents, sister, and sister-in-law after using it for a few months... so that should be evidence of how life-changing I think this Instant Pot is."
1.0 out of 5 stars,"When I was cooking a rice, the steam came bursting along the sides of the lid and it sprayed my entire kitchen walls. Fortunately we were not in the kitchen otherwise it would have become an medical emergency.I bought it from amazon. When I asked for replacement, the instant pot customer service replied that my instant pot is not covered under warranty as it was bought from third party seller from amazon."
5.0 out of 5 stars,Love the versatility of using this. You can make so many recipes in it in such a short cooking time. It’s also easy to clean
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I can't overstate my satisfaction with the instant pot, so far I've cooked chili, a pot roast and veggies, spaghetti squash, and steamed cauliflower to mash. It's easy and just an over all great product that saves time."
5.0 out of 5 stars,Now I know what all the hoopla is about. I love this Instant Pot!! The Duo Plus is perfect for me & my husband. The left overs we freeze for later. I'm glad I got the Plus because of the lighted screen. New York cheesecake is delish made in it!! It's been really fun getting to know this pot. I bought 2 more for Christmas gifts! Thanks Prime Day for a great bargain!!
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love this all in one product.  I like being able to saute then switch to pressure or slow cooker mode.  Cleanup is easy.  I got this at an amazing price on Black Friday and would say it's worth more than I paid for it.  I make everything from stews, roasts and beans.  Great for families in a hurry to put healthy meals on the table.  The sealed pot weather pressure cooking or slow cooking keeps the smells to a minimum.  I've moved my crockpot to the basement and keep the Instant Pot upstairs in its place.  It's a bulky item so I keep it in the closet as opposed to the countertop."
3.0 out of 5 stars,"I absolutely love my Instant Pot, but it is just over a year old, and is starting to not work consistently.  I was making dinner tonight, and it stopped in the middle and stopped working.  I had to keep unplugging and plugging in the cord; it took several tries before it came back on.  I tried plugging it in several times again after I'd finished cooking, and it only turned on less than half the time.  Truly disappointed, especially given it's just four months past the warranty.  :("
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I had one of those instant pot type things that I got from HSN and hated it, so stayed away from instant pot because I thought it was the same thing. It’s SO MUCH BETTER!! I cooked 2lbs of pork roast the other night and it turned out perfect. It also makes some pretty bomb sticky rice."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"My IP is my new BFF. I love how quickly I can cook our favorites. The only thing I don’t like is you have to be super diligent about cleaning the lid, gasket, and area around the lid because it gets stinky fast."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"The instructions and operation of this unit were fairly clear. It easily makes great yogurt at remarkable savings over commercial yogurt. Not only is home crafted yogurt less expensive, I know that there are no fillers of preservatives in that  which we make."
5.0 out of 5 stars,So far we have only made beans and rice in this but it is a very good item to quickly cook food. It’s like a crock pot on steroids.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"What can I say?  I am a big fan of the Instant pot and use it 3-4 times per week.  It is basically the only way I cook now.  I knew I wanted the original brand of IP, not a knockoff and I am not disappointed.  Easy to use, buttons are clear, instruction book is a good starter book, works beautifully.  Hard boiled eggs are my current favorite IP item because it is start, forget about for a few minutes, come back and eggs are done to perfection."
1.0 out of 5 stars,"My instant pot worked 2 times and then the 3rd time I tried to use it, it came up with code C6L. Nothing happened to it that I am aware of."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"My pot came with a small indent in the front of the outer stainless steel pot, right by the display. But as always Amazon gives the best customer service and problem solved. Took a little off for the dent and I kept it. It ain't as pretty but it works fine. So far I have made 15 bean soup. Browned hamburger in it, sautéed onions and garlic & I've heated up left over. So far so good! Found a big bunch of instant pot groupies on FB and all over the net & joined the movement. LOL"
5.0 out of 5 stars,This thing is AMAZING!!!We used to spend 2-3 hours making ribs and now it only takes about 45 minutes total. 35 minutes in the Instant Pot and then 10 minutes in the oven to give it that nice crispy crust. The only problem is that the meat falls off the bones so it's hard to cut haha. The pot is super easy to clean as well so no more nasty hard to clean oven trays.We also make pulled pork and pork belly as well which comes out super moist and flavorful.
1.0 out of 5 stars,My box is lacking the condensation collector.  Contacted IP and they said they don't have any spares in stock and that I should return or exchange the IP.  I've read about other people's IP missing this piece.  I've returned it since IP obviously doesn't care about quality.
2.0 out of 5 stars,"I don’t know what the rave is. I have not liked how most things turn out. I follow the recipes, yet the veggies are mushy. The meat, while falls apart easily, is dry and chewy. I’ve made soups in it and it’s been great for that and that’s about it."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This UPDATE is now 2 years after my IP purchase.  First, as I think everyone knows, the IP is a revelation for hard-cooking eggs.  I live in a farm state and, if I wanted to make deviled eggs for the Fourth of July, I used to have to buy my supermarket eggs on Memorial Day just so that they would age enough to be able to be peeled!  However, with the IP, 6 minutes on LOW and even the freshest eggs from the Farmers’ Market peel as easily as taking off a pair of socks.  Moreover,  I love to cook beans from scratch, and, after  several trials with different types of beans, I now have foolproof timings in my notes for every type of bean:  black, cannellini, navy, kidney, garbanzo, and lentils.  I cook a pound at a time and keep the extras in my freezer ready to make chili or who knows what.  I most appreciate that, when I cook beans in the IP, not only are the times consistent, but the ultimate texture is consistent.  If you’ve ever cooked beans on the stovetop, you’ll understand:  you might cook for hours (timing uncertain:  will they take 2 hours or 4 hours?) and still end up with an unappealing texture.  I love the saute function:  throw some OO and a chopped onion in there, and let the onions cook until I’m ready to add my other ingredients.  I’ve also come to love the IP for rootish vegetables, when I don’t want them to become wet by boiling:  for example, potatoes, which are so much tastier when not cooked soaking wet.  I’ve also come to love cooking rice in the IP, especially mixed rices, whether in a mix, such as Lundberg’s Jubilee or as, just last week, I combined basmati and wild rice.  I’m a wild rice lover.  For decades, I enjoyed it mixed with a white rice, but had to use two pots and two separate cooking times.  However, for some magical reason, I can cook both white and wild rice together in the IP and they turn out perfect (inspired by  Madhura Jaffray’s “Instantly Indian”).  I don’t eat meat, but, if I did, I couldn’t wait to try the IP for short ribs—any kind of ribs, for that matter—pulled pork, meat loaf, pot roast."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"I have to say I absolutely love this product. I have cooked things I never thought I could make and have managed not to mess the majority of meals up.  From a pot roast to mac n cheese this has been great.  I'm still working on baked potatoes.  The reason for the four star review is the stainless steel inner pot.  They make a non-stick coated pot and you should get the option of which one you want.  I hate stainless steel, everything sticks, its a pain to clean.  To solve that problem you guessed it... Another $20."
5.0 out of 5 stars,This is definitely a great addition to the Insta Pot. I also love that I just have an attachment and not a total other appliance. I have been debating on getting one for a long time and I am glad I did.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great equipment addition to my kitchen. Specially for making rice, the rice making feature has worked very well."
5.0 out of 5 stars,When I rec'd the pot there was a tiny crack in the handle. I contacted customer support and within hours they had contacted me and are sending me a new base. I had used the pot and I was very happy with my purchase until a friend noticed the crack and suggested I might want to get it replaced. I will definitely buy from this company again.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I can have breakfast, lunch, or diner on the table in 20-30 minutes.  I now use this Instant Pot for everything!!!!!!I work fulltime, attend nursing school fulltime, I have a 4 year old that just started Preschool, husband that just started a teacher's certification program, and two teenagers in high school and sports.  We are very busy!!!!!!I am from Louisiana so I love everything fresh, slow cooked, and well seasoned.  So It took me along time to purchase this because fast cooking is just not the Louisiana way.  I finally bought it because cooking takes up a lot of time that I no longer have.  I cooked red bean and rice in 20 minutes.  It came out so good, I'm now convinced and use it for everything.  I'veI am still a newbie as I've only had it for a couple of months but I love it.  Where has this been all my life??!!!!!!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my second instant pot, I love that the silicone sealing ring is attached to to lid and it`s very easy to operate."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Hands down the best brown rice cooker I've used. Love that I can throw frozen chicken breasts in and have a flavorful pull apart main dish in 30 minutes total. Meat dishes are always super tender and flavorful. Excellent way to still keep those slow cooker favorites served throughout the summer without heating up your kitchen. Got this ""like new"" for a fraction of the price and it was perfect."
5.0 out of 5 stars,I love it but... it can be hard to the steel sometimes other than that I love having to cook on the stove easy clean up and I can walk away. I have kids 5 under children so this is great for me food is ready less than hour.
1.0 out of 5 stars,Returned immediately. Too large and to confusing to operate.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Easy to use right out of the package.Cooked a roast that would normally take all day, in an hour.It does take time to get up to pressure, so the times listed in the recipe book need to be adjusted for pressure-up and -down time.Steam release valve is definitely something to be aware of and understand."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I  absolutely love this Multi-Functional Instant Pot. The quality of this pressure cooker is top notch. I have used it several times and love all the features that the Instant Pot offers. Between the browning setting and then right into the pressure cooker setting it is quick and easy and such a time saver, especially after working a long day. You can literally have a complete meal on the table in 45 minutes! I would highly recommend this product to anyone in the market for a multi functioning pressure cooker / instant pot."
5.0 out of 5 stars,Havnt had the chance to use it yet cant wait it looks Awdoome! Bigger then I thought hope works cause bought it cheap a minor perfection but worth the price. THANK YOU AMAZON
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I was extremely intimidated by all the functionality of this product. With the booklet, YouTube & Pinterest I’m fully confident & have been able to see its full capabilities!!! Highly recommend :)"
5.0 out of 5 stars,I use it about 3 times a week for some recipes. It works really great and is quite helpful sometimes. I do some recipes that otherwise I would not even think about because it is too long. I also appreciate more the vegetables when cooked under pressure.
1.0 out of 5 stars,"I used twice and lid would not lock after.  Although ""Support"" gave me suggestions regarding ""removing"" some things and taking pictures in order to get support -- that's not what I expect to do.  I'm not a ""handyman"" -- I'm a consumer.I like having such a pot and will purchase another brand now and throw this one in the garbage!!  Don't waste your time or money!!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I LOVE the Instant Pot!!!  I find that a Large Spaghetti Squash is perfect in 5 minutes of cooking and 5 minute of sitting...What took over an hour in the oven is cooked, served, eaten and the left overs put away before they would be cooked in the oven!  Plus, since it was just steamed, you don't have a lot to clean up !  I've used this often and am trying new things in the Instant Pot all to my great delight!!!"
1.0 out of 5 stars,It arrived damaged around the lid and the handle.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my new best friend!  I never even put it in cabinet as I use it every single day!  Anyone that has cooked a venison roast knows how tough they can be, especially a buck in rut.  This instantpot cooked that roast in less than 30 minutes to super tender, fall apart roast.  Boiling eggs is a breeze.  I can't say enough about this thing---it really has been a time saver for a busy working mom."
3.0 out of 5 stars,"Been using it for 14 months, worked great, but while cooking a $26 corn beef brisket, screen went blank and pot doesn't respond.  I should have bought the extended warranty, sorry I didn't.  I have to give it a 3 rating, because it's only been used for 14 months and it shouldn't of died shortly after the manufacturer's warranty of 1 year.  Buy the extended warranty, it'll be worth it.  Wish I did!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is an extremely handy kitchen appliance to have, and I bought one for my mother as well.  It can cook almost anything, doubling as a slow cooker as well as a pressure cooker.  We've cooked everything from ribs to rice with minimal effort and saved time and money doing it.  Not sure how long it will last, but so far I have zero regrets and will buy another if this one breaks."
1.0 out of 5 stars,Safety issue. Lid melted and deformed on normal store. Support has not yet responded to what to do next.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have never bothered to take the time to review a product from Amazon before... but this - it was worth it.  I ordered this after reading about it on several paleo blogs.  I had a rice cooker, 2 crock pots and and a pressure cooker in the cabinet - rarely used any of them because they were all a nuisance in some way (cleaning, length of time required for recipes and scared, respectively).I have had the Instant Pot for 2 weeks and have used it 4-5 times already.  I just made bone broth in TWO hours.  Not two days (like in my crock pot).  I have made beef stews where the same beef and the same recipes in my crock pot produced chewy meat.  In the Instant Pot -  fall apart tender meat.The saute feature is great - now all my recipes that require high heat first (searing meat, sauteing veggies, etc) can all be done in just one place meaning less to clean up.  I do a lot of cooking eating paleo and this is definitely a time saver since the pressure cooking allows me to cook stews, soups, etc in half the time (plus so pans and stove to clean).We are soon going to have access to grass fed milk and I'm looking forward to trying the yogurt making feature.Overall I wish I hadn't waited so long to get this item."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"My husband bought this instant pot to make Indian food, but I have been using it to make stews and soups.  I had used an old fashioned pressure cooker for 43 years!  This thing is a huge improvement over my vintage pot.  I was skeptical at first, but I like that it doesn't make a lot of noise while pressure cooking.  I don't have to keep my eye on the stove either because it has a timer.  Good purchase."
5.0 out of 5 stars,Only works with certain InstaPots. Purchase a Mealthy life for my daughter who has an InstaPot. Swapped it out and it works great. Has a higher profile sitting on top. She loves it
4.0 out of 5 stars,"Takes a bit of trial and error, but my wife and I have really been enjoying our Instant Pot. There are so so many recipes available online and we like it enough to purchase a 2nd liner so we can use it more often. The only drawback is that the rubber seal tends to hold onto food smells even when washed thoroughly."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Does what is says and in a hurry.  The last pressure cooker I remember was my mothers with the top weight that rocked back and forth.  They were considered dangerous.  This thing is quite, looks and feels of good quality.  I cooked an entire chicken with rice and vegges all in 20ish minutes.  I thought there was no way, but sure enough it works great.  I have cooked steel cut oats in minutes.  Pinto beans not pre-soaked in 20ish minutes also.  Rice is so fast it is a joke.  I have not tried the yogurt setting yet."
5.0 out of 5 stars,I can't cook to save my life but with this thing and following very simple instructions and good recipes ... everything comes out great!!!
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Best thing I have purchased for myself in a long time! I cannot believe how fast this thing cooks whatever I put into it. I have cooked a roast and chicken enchilada soup thus far, and I cannot be happierwith the results. I would definitely recommend getting an Instant Pot. You will never want to use your Crock-Pot again!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This pot is very versatile. I have cooked, rice, Boston Butt, chicken,  Sweet potato's, boiled eggs, and steamed vegetables.I got this just after Christmas. My cousin has one,... that she cooked gumbo on, that got me interested.Not everything has been perfect, ( but not too bad) but I'm learning.I highly recommend."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Oh InstantPot!  How do I love thee?  Let me count the ways -1- You make cooking dry beans easy.  Forgot to soak your beans in advance?  5:00pm on a weeknight?  No problem!2- You replaced my rice cooker.  Not only do you make a lot of rice perfectly, but you do it every single time!3- Steaming is a piece of cake.  Insert rack, add just a bit of water, close the lid, set the time, and walk away.  No babysitting (is it simmering?  Is it boiling like crazy?) and no worries about the pan going dry.  I can make seitan at home for a fraction of the cost in the store this way.4- Baking potatoes?  Making potato salad?  I know a shortcut!  Less time.  Less water.  Yes, please!5- Making yogurt is a breeze.  Unlike my other yogurt maker, I can make 2qts of yogurt and the InstantPot keeps track of the time for me.6- Quantity.  The 6qt stainless steel insert means I can make enough chili to feed a crowd and transport it without it spilling or cooling off on the way.  Potlucks are so much simpler since the InstantPot arrived at my house.Some days I wish I had two!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Bought two of these as Christmas gifts.  They both love them.  Always worried that a thing like this won’t get used and end up in the cabinet collecting dust, but they both have used already.  Apparently there is a great Facebook group for these things and it is so much easier to use than the crock pot."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"if you don't have one you need to get one. I give you permission, you will not regret!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great large product. Easy to use, cooks fast. Steam trap, for liquids is a tiny plastic cup you put on the side that falls off, and catches nothing. Food tastes good, meat is very tender. Shipped fast. Worth the money, needs a few upgrades."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Works good for soup, and great for porridge. Just put in rice and water, push one button, will get good meal in 20mins. Very happy. (Those fancy steam food recipe didn’t work out... Maybe because I’m really not good at cooking. Won’t blame the pot. Fast one button porridge and meat soup are good enough for me.)"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"What an amazing device! Was able to cook my first meal in a 3rd of the time it would have taken if I cooked it on the stove, without sacrificing the taste!!! Just an amazing product!!! Don't wait, get this now, you won't regret it, trust me on this!!!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm a bachelor who is not a big fan of cooking... BUT I also want to eat healthy and cheap. I bought the Instant Pot to make cooking easier. I've made a handful of simple meals and gotten the hang of it after some research. It's a little troublesome to understand, but once you have it down it's super efficient. My foods come out with more flavor and texture than they ever did otherwise and with way less effort."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I got the lid on Sunday and I love the food that I have made this week. ❤️ First i made french fries and they were delicious. Crispy and no grease. Next I made fried parmesan shrimp.  Dipped in flour, then egg/milk mixture, then flour/parmesan. So good.  Today i made roasted almonds with spicy salt using raw almonds."
3.0 out of 5 stars,"Nice looking  with lots of bells and whistles and very poor instructions on use.  If you want to figure it out find someone who has mastered it teach you. I have reverted to using my old slow cooker, one knob hi-lo. Turn it on in the morning and dinner is ready at 5."
5.0 out of 5 stars,I have always used a stove top pressure cooker. I thought I would treat myself and see what everyone is raving about.I am blown away. I love to cook and this multicooker is AMAZING. Everyday I have been using it ..sometimes several times and I have not been disappointed. It is nothing like cooking with a stove top pc..no hissing. And you can set it and forget it. TRULY A JOY TO COOK WITH.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Absolutely LOVE making recipes in the Instapot. Some of our faves are chicken & dumplings, beef short ribs, pad thai chicken, chicken marsala, baby back ribs, beef stew. This prep method can't be beat for moist and tender meats!"
2.0 out of 5 stars,"I got this because it was on sale, I should have held back. It's really only any good for small batches of food, so it ends up quicker just to use the griddle or fryer."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've only had this about a week but have made delicious pork & kraut so far and I have tried it for the yogurt - excellent Greek yogurt! I am really impressed with it so far and love the fact that there is no loud hissing like with a manual pressure cooker. I have an egg rack on order and can't wait to try  it for ""boiled"" eggs."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"We love the instant pot.  We use it nearly every day for steel cut oatmeal (pot in pot method), hard boiled eggs and sticky rice.  Great for cooking a whole chicken and browning it using the sautee setting.  After cooking the chicken, make bone broth in a fraction of the time.  use and cleanup is pretty easy.I wish it came with a vegetable steamer basket.I would buy this again."
1.0 out of 5 stars,"expected meat to be tender and juicy.  Was not.  Cooked a sweet potato according to directions , 20 minutes on high pressure, and was surprised to find it had not cooked at all.  Had to finish cooking in microwave."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"ordered this as a gift for my nephew who says it is great - he also plans to have a small garden this summer and this will be perfect for canning as well.  he said there is a lot of instructions and will take some time to plow thru but i am certain, and so is he, that this will nt be a major hindrance.  i scanned pressure cooker recipes i had and sent them to him.  he is looking forward to having fun with this."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased this after over a year of wanting one, but have been scared to pull the trigger. I am so glad that I did! My first meal was wings from the blog Good Dinner Mom and they were perfect. Then I followed a pasta recipe out of the book that came with it, and it went perfectly as well.Instant pots don't necessarily cook things ""instantly"", so it does often take a while. But it's so nice to be able to ""set and forget"" like in a crockpot but in less than half the time. The buttons may seem overwhelming at first, but if you follow the water test like you're supposed to, it's a good way to get you used to them before diving in with food"
4.0 out of 5 stars,"Quick delivery; good product! Disappointed that extra pieces were not included as they were when I purchased my previous instapot... plastic spoon, measuring cup"
5.0 out of 5 stars,Game changer - able to put cooking healthy meals almost on autopilot.Be sure to get a cookbook written for the Instant Pot. Remarkable range of good things to make. It’s not just another kitchen gadget.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Randomly read about electric pressure cookers on Reddit and thought to give it a chance. As a college kid, my broke self waited until Black Friday for a sale and scooped one up. This thing is a godsend. I make soups, chili, hot sauce, frozen chicken breasts, and even a turkey! It's made it easier for me to cook at home instead of always going out to eat. Although meat doesn't look as good coming out of this, it's nothing a little searing beforehand or broiling in an oven afterwards can't fix. Cleaning is easy too! Highly recommend. I don't even like cooking. I just like eating."
5.0 out of 5 stars,I have been debating on purchasing for a while. It is great. You can cook frozen chicken very quickly and it tastes delicious. There are so many options with the instant pot. The pot is dishwasher safe which is another great feature.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I LOVE my instant pot.  I go through phases of using it every day and then kind of forgetting about it, but it gets more use than any other small appliance in my kitchen.  This thing is great for making perfect medium-boiled eggs for the family for breakfast that peel with ease.  That alone is worth the cost!  The saute feature is awesome, I made chicken and dumplings in homemade broth yesterday without having to use any other appliance or pan.  I hear it is fabulous for cooking rice, although we haven't tried that yet for some reason.  This is definitely the best appliance you never knew you needed!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"From slow cooker to pressure cooker, I use this more than anything else in our house!  I am very picky about how  white rice is cooked (yes, I am Asian born and raised in Asia)  and I used this as rice cooker.  This makes better rice than my Zojirushi that I got rid of it after I got this pressure cooker.  The key is you don't leave 10 mins after it is done.  I leave it for 5 or 6 mins.  I have all kinds of meat and I honestly don't know how I survived without this for so long!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Voluntarily joined the Instant Pot cult I should say!  I have used my IP to make a wide variety of dishes from salmon to ribs to meatloaf to mac & cheese.  And then there is homemade yogurt and and and.... I don't like to cook.  I cook because I like to eat and prefer homemade semi-healthy foods.  The IP makes all of it possible with a little less effort.  It's not ALWAYS faster, but do a little reading and learning and you will quickly figure it all out.  Love it."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"My only regret is that I didn't buy one of these sooner!  Soups, stews, Chili's, sauces, anything that requires hours to cook can be done with this amazing pressure cooker.  I made ramen broth and pho(which normally takes ALL DAY) within the span of a few hrs and it came out amazing!  Highly recommend this product!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"After hearing all the hype from Co workers I decided to give it a try. It's everything promised, it's an amazing and fast way to make good food at home.  I've just begun exploring all the cooking modes, but man it's so convenient. It's like a Crock-Pot on steroids."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"LOVE this! I use this everyday. Heck I even enjoy eggs made in this, they come out perfect and the peel sooooo easy! Being able to sauté is a real nice feature and it works GREAT! The only thing I don't like, which is a common problem, the silicon ring holds odor not matter how you clean it. If anyone has a solution for that please let me know.This was the best investment I've made in a long time. It replaced several bulky appliances that I kept in a cabinet! This baby stays on my counter and works everyday!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my 3rd instant pot. I have one I take camping, one large one and this smaller one for when I'm cooking for two. I can make hard boiled eggs, rice, saute and brown meat then make soup. There isn't anything this pot can't do. Then when I'm done it cleans easy. I love it!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,Bought this for my spouse and she uses it 3-4 times each week since it has arrived. I will tell you that if you like yogurt and never though about making your own don't fear cause this does everything for you. Why pay $.80+ for a small amount of yogurt when you can make it for $2.00 or the price of a gallon of milk. This works so simple just set it and forget it. Then dinner is ready in minutes. As a side note we both are using this and loving it a lot.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my new favorite toy. I would probably not recommend this to people who are looking to save time because they dislike cooking. But for people who love to cook and fool around in the kitchen-- get one! It's great fun. Beans and rice are cheap and healthy so I've been playing around with making up recipes for them using my ""iPot"" quite a lot since I got it about 3 months ago. Cooks a delicious rack of ribs in under 45 minutes that tastes like it's been on the grill all day. I love it."
3.0 out of 5 stars,"Hmmmm. I think the poor results so far from using this product has more to do with me needing to trial different cook times, as most of what I've tried is way undercooked. I quartered a head of cabbage and used the recommended time/pressure, and only the outside leaves of each quarter were properly steamed. I'm going to keep experimenting though. The unit itself is well made, and fairly easy to use. Just watch your hands when you vent that steam!!"
1.0 out of 5 stars,"Even though I received this on June 14th, I used it for the 1st time today (July 18th). There appears to be something wrong with the valve.  In the instruction manual it says the piece by the valve is supposed to pop up when the pressure is on. This is not happening, so all of the heat is staying in the bottom and burning the food. The burn indicator comes on, and I had to dump out what was in the pot, soak and scrub all of the excess food off of the bottom of the pot, and try again. The same thing happened. I have looked up everything I can find online and can’t seem to fix this issue. I would like a full refund on this product."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Always wanted to have one. This one is supposed to be good for beginners and I felt it was easier then what I saw in Youtube about other pressure cookers. I love that you just need to press something to release the air pressure instead of turning something around. I just cooked lentil stew and it was so easy, simple and simple. Can't wait to try more. Oh but the smell is really strong, after you release the pressure. Must try to release it near a window next time."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"After several months of use, we've been really happy with our Instant Pot Duo. First of all, what this thing can do with a stew is incredible. Incredibly tender meat and perfectly cooked veggies in under an hour. Wow. In fact, I've yet to have a bad meal come out of this thing yet.I originally planned on purchasing a slow cooker, but I find myself barely ever using that function now. Everything is better in a pressure cooker! So glad I went with this."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Even though I don't use it for all it can do, it's a great item. Good to use in summer when it's too hot to cook, and this one can fit a whole chicken. Then throw the bones back in to make broth. Half the time of regular cooking and delicious results. Cleaning it really well can be a little bit of a chore due to the shape of the lid and plastic ring, so I've mostly kept using it for savory dishes."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Seems to be standing up for almost daily use for more than 2 months now. The inside vessel is made from stainless steel unlike others which are non-stick (ceramic) coated. So it is easy to clean even the most messiest sticky things. Have not explored all the different settings yet.But some of the items like the water drip catcher and the lid itself, I am not sure how long lasting they are."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought the 8 qt because you can always make smaller quantities in a big cooker, but if you have something big, the smaller cooker might not work, so for the small price differential I went big.  It has worked will with everything I have made, including a whole chicken, rice, steamed veggies, yogurt, etc."
1.0 out of 5 stars,This product only worked once.  The second time I tried to use this instant pot it would not turn on at all.  Unfortunately the return window was already passed.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I am absolutely addicted to this thing. At the time I bought it, this 8qt was on sale, cheaper than the 6qt that I was planning on getting, and now I am SO GLAD I got this one instead. It’s perfect for a family of four, and I don’t think a day has gone by yet that I haven’t used it. This thing is serious marriage material, and I’m pretty sure my husband he met me before I met my instant pot..."
5.0 out of 5 stars,I don’t have enough good things to say about my instant pot. It is the perfect size for me as I like to cook once for the whole week. I can easily make 5-10 meal portions in under 2 hours. It is such a dream to cook with and has so many versatile settings and features. It even keeps your food warm for 12 hours!
5.0 out of 5 stars,This was a gift and I will continue to give them  to my children and persons getting married! Such a great product.  We use ours all the time.
5.0 out of 5 stars,It has changed the way my family eats. Fresh & whole ingredients I choose to cook for my family.  No more frozen breaded meats..and oh the Mac & Cheese is the best ever.  Yogurt was the main reason for purchasing the InstaPot but now I'm cooking all of my meals in it.  I'm buying a second 7 in 1 InstaPot so I can cook my yogurt and make a meal at the same time.It has saved so much money because I was purchasing 3- 32 ounce yogurts a week....now I buy 2 gallons of whole milk and have enough yogurt for over 1 week. Plus the taste and texture after you strain it is premium yogurt!
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Do I need say more. This is the coolest gadget in my kitchen so far. Google Instant pot recipes and enjoy it my dear friend. No more timer setting, and I can check on other things while it takes care of my food. Dinner ready in 15 minutes. A total time saver.TIP- If you plan to cook kidney beans in this, make sure to soak it overnight and then boil it for couple of minutes. Kidney beans has some toxins which needs to be removed by boiling or so. Read some food poisoning cases on the internet, so just a heads up for the newbies. Else, this is god send."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love this pressure cooker!  I use it for many things.  I have the smaller one and I had to buy a bigger one when my boys are older and when I cook roasts.  I have cooked roasts, made rice pudding, cooked potatoes for mashed potatoes.  I love how it can sauté and not dirty up another dish.  I have used it for a slow cooker.  I put a towel over the steam when it releases the steam."
3.0 out of 5 stars,"It is a very good instant pot.  I rated lower because besides perfect rice,  I prefer either roasting or slow cooker.  Instant pot a lot of hype, in my opinion,  but if it encourages another generation or two to enjoy cooking, so be it."
5.0 out of 5 stars,Made some good healthy recipes!Love speed! Like cooking beans from dry without soaking! Lots of spices on beans required!Got it on prime day for great price! Never seen offered that cheap again!!
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I am extremely satisfied with this product and have used it nearly everyday since it arrived nearly a month ago. Yesterday I did a full pot of steamed seafood (shrimp, crab legs, potatoes, corn, and sausage) in about 15 minutes including the stage to build pressure. I did a lobster in the broiler only because it wouldn't fit and that's probably the only downside to this product - its limited capacity - we are mostly a family of three so it works fine for us on a routine basis; however, I do like to entertain regularly and that would require me to do things in batches. I have also done ribs which I precooked in the Instant Pot and finished up on the grill. My husband said they were some of the best ribs he'd ever had. It is wonderful for soups and stews - I also used it to cook batches of sweet potatoes - the first time I did them I over cooked them and had to use them for mashed sweet potatoes. The next time I did them I only set it for about seven minutes and they came out great - keep in mind we eat off of these for the week so they will be reheated which is why it was better for me to under cook them just a bit. I have used this product so much it has feeling now that i can get rid of some of my pots. Overall, I highly recommend this product - you won't be disappointed!"
4.0 out of 5 stars,Been wanting an Instant Pot for a long time and finally got one. I didn’t realize the side was dented until I was already preparing a meal in it. Works great! Just unfortunate that it arrived slightly damaged. Already tossed the box and all so I’m not gonna send it back just for a cosmetic issue.
5.0 out of 5 stars,Simply love. Fact -  I put frozen chicken in with some spices and vegetables first did sauté option then added chicken broth and pressure cooked option for 10 minutes and had a healthy but tasty dinner on the table that everyone loved. I'm sold. Forget a slow cooker this one thing does everything you want on a busy weekday.
5.0 out of 5 stars,Makes meats fall off the bone.  An Added Plus.......I  found Jeffery Eisner from pressure luck on You Tube with tons of delicious recipes using the Instant pot.  I'm thrilled.
1.0 out of 5 stars,I have an issue with the “burn” error. Almostevery time I am cooking I get the error even though I follow known instant pot recipes. I have tried all the tips I have found online ondeglazing and really scrubbing the bottom of the pot before turning on the pressure cook but none of it seems to help to the point that I am starting to think my product is defective. I have had my instant pot it for 3 months now and am battling this issue ever since.
5.0 out of 5 stars,Purchased this as a gift for a single young man and he first used it to make pulled-pork for sandwiches. He confirmed that the pork turned out delicious. Excellent purchase and gift.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"We are still learning how to best use this appliance.  We’ve made so e fantastic dishes and we’ve had a few not so good results, but the ability to prepare so much in one pot and to cook so rapidly is great."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"First day I owned it I was able to tell how useful it will be. You can make complete meals, side dishes, deserts, etc. I would recommend a cookbook specifically for Instant Pots to help learn the basics."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love the fact that even on slow cooking you can saute and simmer in the same pot. For example, when making chili I always saute onions, garlic and the beef together in a separate pan. Then I have to remove it to the crockpot. This completely eliminates that extra step.  I also made Black Eyed Peas for New Year's with a ham hock. It only took 20 minutes and my guests loved it."
5.0 out of 5 stars,We use ours mostly for pressure cooking and slow cooking. Very worthwhile product. I bought some for my brother and sister too and they enjoy theirs as well.Works well while camping as well. Don't have to worry about animals getting in it.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've used my Instant Pot to cook stew several times, chicken dishes and stuffed peppers,Spanish rice even hard boiled eggs.  Anything I cook now, I look at the Instant Pot recipes first and usually find them. As a bonus the recipes and typically easy and, of course, quick.  So far so good."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"It’s all the rage, so I thought I’d try one when it was on sale.  I’ve used it once, to make a Pork roast... it worked as promised.  However I feel like I have an explosive device in my kitchen.  Be careful with it.Still... it seems to do the job."
5.0 out of 5 stars,I finally broke down and bought one and it is everything I hoped for and more! Great product and easy to use. Tons of recipes out there on the web and it has replaced 4 other appliances in my home.I just recently moved to a much smaller place and this has been a great item to have. No heating the kitchen up and it's great for on the go cooking homes.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I should have gotten this a long time ago!  Great time saver, easy to use.  The meals prepared in this are full flavored, moist, delicious.  Cleanup is easy.  I always brown beef and pork using the saute setting and then add everything else and use the meat/stew setting.  Fork tender pork chops and pot roast in less than an hour!  My jasmine rice cooks up perfectly on the rice setting.  I haven't tried the yogurt yet but will soon.  I highly recommend this for anyone!  ps:  MY HUBBY USES IT TO COOK A LOT WHEN I'M TRAVELLING AND HE LOVES IT."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"It works very well. I have an 8 qt size, it is quite bulky, so you do need some space for it. I threw away a few old pots in my kitchen. Speed wise, it takes some time to develop the pressure, and then some time to release the pressure. However, it can be left alone, while it is doing its job. I don’t use it for everything. Many foods I cook does not need a pressure cooker. But, many slow cooker recipes can be converted to quick pressure cooker recipes. I do think that it is for people who like to cook. It will take me some time before I have tried all the options it has, such as rice and sauté etc"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This has become a great kitchen appliance!  We use it at least one a week and we are always amazed and happy the way food comes out!  We have made many great dishes and it amazing how well pasta dishes turn out, go figure!  Very glad we bought one!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought this because I had read about it on a few blogs. This has completely upped my dinner game… I can cook healthy, clean, fresh meals for my family in minutes-- that taste like I spent all day on it. This won't even get put up in my cabinet, Stays out on the countertop all the time. I cook five out of seven dinners a week in this. You can find amazing recipes all over the web/blogs for the Instant Pot."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This thing changed my eating and cooking habits, to better! It is so easy and fast to cook with it and food tastes so much better. I use it for almost every main dish that I prepare, except for cooking pasta. The longest something takes to cook is frozen meat, up to 20 min., but everything else (veggies) are done within 2-3 minutes,  after this thing builds up pressure. Easy to clean, and once you get the instructions down, it is a no-brainer to use. Very pleased I got it and it is worth every dime. Received it promptly and it's been in use daily since I bought it a few months ago."
5.0 out of 5 stars,This amazing time saving device has completely replaced at least two other appliances in our kitchen and I predict maybe one more in the future. The ability to fill this lovely device with ingredients and come home to hot meal after work is absolutely amazing.
1.0 out of 5 stars,"Loved the use for 3 dinners. 4th dinner all set, NOTHING HAPPENED.  WE TRIED ANOTHER OUTLET, SAMENOTHING HAPPENED. Called Company Warranty and they said the fuse. Must have been the trouble. 1.50 for a fuse, dismantle the cooker and replace the fuse.I DON'T THINK SO.!  Company sent NEW replacement, two weeks later. Cooked our first meal of chicken 😁 and wasGreat. Let you know if in the futureWe have problems. GOOD LUCK WITH YOURS. 🤭🤭😘"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Of all the appliances in my kitchen, this one is my favorite. I put things in frozen, choose whether I want slow cook, or pressure cook, turn it on & it does the rest of the work. I love that the liner inside is made of metal, not glass, & allows me to brown things if I desire. I love that the directions on the outside are relatively self explanatory (not crazy about reading a huge manual & it is not needed).  It will keep things warm for 10 hours, which I find to be a real advantage, as we do not always eat when scheduled, & also allows me to set it in the morning, & cook the time I would like, then it keeps it warm for me."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have had several electric pressure cookers in the past few years,and the Instant pot is,bar none, the very best pressure cooker I have ever had or seen.  First of all,the stainless steel pot is very high quality,and it is the only one I have ever seen that has adjustable temperature for the browning,or saute' cycle,which I think is very important and makes it so much easier to use.  I also like the way you can just rest the cover in the handle when you open it,instead of looking for a place to set it down. The entire unit is very high quality,and I just can't say enough good things about it.I use it almost every day,sometimes twice in a day. I am elderly,and it makes my life so much easier;also,the stainless steel pot cleans so easy. LOVE it!!  ~Dotty~"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I received my Instant Pot yesterday and just tried it out.  I own two pressure cookers so I am neither afraid of pressure cooking nor a novice.  I was blown away with the rapid cooking and quality of the dish I prepared using the Instant Pot.  I am one of those who cooks almost everything from scratch, which means hours in the kitchen that really should be spent sleeping.  I can't wait to experiment with some more dishes - that sleep deficit may soon be a thing of the past!"
4.0 out of 5 stars,"So far one of the best thing I have purchased for my kitchen. Very easy to make curry, rice and other stuff."
5.0 out of 5 stars,We love our Instant Pot Duo 7in1. We have tried new recipes we may not have ever tried without the Instant Pot. I'm retired and have no desire to spend the better part of the day with meal prep. The Instant Pot cuts the prep time way down and we still get a delicious meal.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased the Instant Pot DUO80 after reading many reviews and have not been disappointed.  Glad I purchased the larger size, particularly when I am cooking for larger groups. There are plently of Instant Pot videos and blogs online for tips, great recipes and other user experiences. The multi-function capabilty is great for home use as well as for the RV where you might not have room to store/use multiple cooking appliances."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"We decided on this product after much shopping.  I must say that the instructions in the accompanying booklet were daunting. After reading the instruction booklet, I was convinced that this was a very complicated device.  However, I jumped in, put some soup ingredients in the stainless steel insert, and figured out where to hang the condensation collector and how to close the vent.  I pushed the button for soup and the Instant Pot did the rest.  After my first experiment, I ""got it"" and put aside the instruction booklet. I now rely on the one-page Quick Reference Guide.  This product has cooked everything perfectly so far."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I don’t even know where to start. I was on the fence about buying one of these for well for a year. After joining the Instant Pot Community on FB, I decided to finally bite the bullet and get one. GAME CHANGER!!! I work full-time nights, so cooking dinner before going in has always been rough. Not anymore! My family gets fresh, hot meals in half the time. My picky eater child and skeptical husband are even sold on this. All I can say is that if you are on the fence, GO FOR IT!"
4.0 out of 5 stars,"This thing is giant. And great. I've only tried it for beans and to be honest, I haven't really found any other recipes that look appealing. Also, I didn't feel like this cooked super fast or anything. Even when you cook your food for only 30 minutes. It still takes 2 hours for it to simmer out all of the pressure. Sure you could let the pressure out yourself manually, but then your beans will still be hard...so...eh"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love this pot!! I cannot say enough good things about it’s quality and It is so easy to use. Every recipe I have made in the Instant Pot has been cooked perfectly. I was amazed at how quiet it is. I have another brand that is quite noisy. Anyway, I highly recommend the Instant Pot for beginners to experienced cooks."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"OMG, if you do not have one, buy one. My only regret is that I did not order it off the TV to get the cookbooks I now see.  I would get a couple for a big family.  I have make mouth watering pot roast in here with potatoes and carrots in just over 1 hour  (65 mins).  That's probably because I didn't know how long.  Times are getting shorter.  The pressure does wonders for pork roasts, etc.  Makes PERFECT rice every time.  You will love this!!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"We absolutely love this pressure cooker, as this is the only pressure cooker I’ve had so can’t compare to others.  Cooks well. You can make everything in it. From hard boiled eggs to pork roast."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"My favorite kitchen appliance! Hard boiled eggs are a dream to shell cooked in the instant pot. I use it for so many things, sweet potatoes, bean soup from scratch, chili, veggies, fruit infused water, it is quick and the food is so flavorful. You will not regret purchasing this item!"
4.0 out of 5 stars,I like the insta pot but I don't love it. Don't be fooled into thinking this thing is a one stop shop. It does a couple things well but not everything. I love it for making soups and saucy meals. But it's far from perfect.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm gonna be honest, I have no business in the kitchen. I'm the type of person that could find a way to burn water.  However, since I got my Instant Pot, I have had so many successes! Mashed potatoes! Rice! Horchata! Buffalo Chicken Dip! Soup! This really did open up a new world for me!"
1.0 out of 5 stars,"Purchased this and did the water test as instructed.  Water sputtered out of the release valve continuously through the entire cycle.  It was very loud and messy.  Re-positioned my seals, wiped everything down and tried again.  Same thing. Did this 4 times.  I have opened a help ticket with Instant Pot and have yet to be contacted or receive a response.  Will be returning this.  Very disappointed.  I have another brand and have never had an issue with it.  But everyone has raved about the additional features on this brand so decided to give it a try.  I have until tomorrow to return according to Amazons window so I feel lucky at least since according to other reviews, this same issue has occurred but after the window to return had closed."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I had been wanting a pressure cooker for a long time.  I wanted one with a stainless pot and not one with the non-stick coating. I love my pressure Cooker and use it at least twice a week.  I wish it had came with more recipes but I have found that viewing youtube videos is very helpful. I love my pressure cooker.  One of my favorite meals now is to place potatoes in the bottom, add one cup water, layer cubed steak on top, add a can of Golden Mushroom soup and cook for 20 minutes.  Remove the steak and potatoes and set on saute to reduce the liquid down to a delicious gravy which only take a few minutes.  Comes out perfect every time."
2.0 out of 5 stars,I have used this a couple of times. It did great on my steel cut oats.  How ever i can't find a way to get recipes for it from the company. The link doesnt work and logging in I could only purchase no place to get recipes?
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love my Instant Pot. I've made a lot of dishes and my husband raves about all of them. Have been able to use the different functions, so all dishes are cooked well and are delicious. I especially loved cooking ""Turkey Chili"" and make it often. Most of the time I use the saute function and then switch over to the pressure cooker, per recipe. Just love this cooker."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love this!  I found a website that allows you to plan meals ahead.  So I make a few weeks worth of dinners, stick them in the freezer and email the recipes to my husband.  When I'm working he pulls out what he wants, plunks it in the instant pot, pushes the buttons according to recipe directions and bam, meal is done in 15 minutes.  Every  meal has been tasty!  Chili, veggie-beef stew, chicken parm, honey bourbon chicken, french dip, pot roast, etc.  Highly recommend!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,Venting/Steam seems to be unreliable; Don't see the big deal other than timing with this. I can do the same thing in other things. Saves time but not dishes. Not as impressed as others. Makes one heck of a mess when vent is opened. Shoots liquid/gravy all over kitchen.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I got this on Black Friday 2018.  I've used it on average, at least once a week.  To be able to take something like a frozen chuck roast and turn it into beef barbacoa in an hour is amazing.  I also make quick and easy pho (beef and chicken) in an hour.  It's easily one of the best kitchen tools that I've ever purchase...next to my coffee machine.  :-)"
1.0 out of 5 stars,"I've had this for a month now and today it just didn't turn on when I plugged it in. The cord plugs into the unit, and then the other end plugs into the wall. I made sure both ends were tightly connected, and then I checked multiple outlets. The thing died randomly."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Got this item on Black Friday deal. All of our camping friends have them so we figured why not. This is an amazing item!  I have used it for dinner at least 10 times since i bought. Beef stew, from frozen to table 45 minutes with the most tender beef!  Frozen chicken breasts fully cooked in 15minutes!  2 pounds frozen ground turkey to taco meat in 20 minutes. I cant reccomend this item enough!  This is a must have"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Gave it one star for safety. I love this thing, but the steam release valve could be a little safer. I just use a silicon glove rated to 400 degrees fahrenheit. Over all this is a great appliance, really well made, easy to use and I am still learning all the things you can do with it. Its like the dremmel tool of kitchen appliances."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This pressure cooker is the ideal appliance. It cooks rice in like 5 minutes after warm up, cooks frozen chicken so well the meat falls off the bones as you eat it in under 15 minutes, and is easy to use & clean up. It has a removable pot on the inside and that makes for easy clean up. The only thing that would help better is if when the ring bell goes off and you must go press the release steam button, it would be great if it did that on its own. We have made so many dishes in this steamer, and it encourages us for much healthier eating since it cooks so fast."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I wasn't quite sure what to expect, I was slow jumping on the Instant Pot wagon, but we love it and use it daily!!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,I bought four more for christmas gifts. it's the best kitchen appliance on the planet. I bet i use it at least once a day and often two or three times. (and I'm cooking for one).
1.0 out of 5 stars,"I am so excited to have an Instant Pot and presume I will rate it highly, but it gave a C1 Error Message first time I plugged it in-- the manual and any other things I've read have all said that's something you have to go through customer service to address (it is a central temperature detection error).  I put in a support ticket right away-- that's just been two days, and no word back-- hoping to hear back sooner than later.  Wondering what others' turnaround time has been for support tickets?"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Such a great investment! Don’t be intimidated by this pressure cooker. It’s NOT like your parents or grandparents! Modern technology let’s you create the most delicious “Sunday Meals” in 1/10th of the time! Recipes are all over the Internet, so no excuse not to cook well! Seriusolt, chicken soup in and hot-better than your grandmothers that sat in the stove all day!!! Worth every penny!!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,Love it! All the features in one is just great. I am using it regularly! Love being able to make yogurt since the temp is so consistent. I've also made cottage cheese! I'll be trying ricotta next. I recently put a chunk of frozen ground beef in it for 20 min and it came out great! I've made all sorts of recipes I've found from Instantpot groups on Facebook and such and haven't been disappointed yet.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Works great, does everything it says and more.Creativity is the limit.Unassembling and cleaning the lid is not hard but a little tedious, other than that I could use it every day."
5.0 out of 5 stars,I Love the Instant Pot. Fun to use. Awesome food comes out that I never dreamed I could make. Well made. The other brands can't touch this Instant Pot. put nutritious food on your table fast.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"My wife simply loves this and even gave away her crock pot.  Take a piece of meat that could be shoe leather and it will make it tender and succulent.  We have been able to salvage some store bought meat by cooking it in the Instant Pot under pressure.  But do NOT think you can toss in veggies with the meat and end up with an ideal stew - the veggies will be mush by the time the meat is done.  Cook stews in stages - meat until done, then a second, short time for everything and you'll be very happy."
4.0 out of 5 stars,Overall happy with product on first use. Need to read manual to operate. Its compact and nice. One less equipment on counter top without losing functionality.
5.0 out of 5 stars,Made a bbq beef brisket.... high pressure for 90 mins and it was better than anything I have got from a restaurant!This cooker is amazing!
4.0 out of 5 stars,I like it. But I am also confused by it. The timing is all messed up. I hate that 5 instapot minutes equals some arbitrary number of minutes close to 30. Also I have burned myself a couple of times while opening the steam valve.
4.0 out of 5 stars,"Beyond that i have not found much this does for us keto people that other stuff does just as well or better. Just personally, haven't seen the value."
5.0 out of 5 stars,I'm very pleased with this and recommend it to anyone and everyone. Well worth the cost and you can cook virtually anything in it. Search the internet for a recipe you don't even need a cookbook. However I would recommend a good cookbook with information on cleaning and care points. Check the reviews on cookbooks and even look inside a few of them and you will see what I mean.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"As someone who loathes cooking and knows very little about it, this appliance is amazing to me and makes me want to keep trying new recipes. It’s incredibly easy to use and dishes that would take hours to cook using other methods are done in a fraction of the time. Go for it!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,I love my instant pot. I have totally Replaced  places my crockpot. Meat always comes out tender and juicy. I have cooked beans in more than half the time and without soaking.
5.0 out of 5 stars,Great product
5.0 out of 5 stars,"My goto device for cooking.  From boiled eggs to chili to Indian butter chicken.  Goodbye rice cooker, crockpot, slow cooker,  stove top pressure cooker.  This device replaces them all.Why the Instant Pot over the others?- safety  (I've used the others, and Instant Pot is really that much better)- stainless!  (this alone was a huge deal for us, there is no Teflon coated pan, the stainless cleans easy and is SAFE)- easy and top choice by a lot of the top food bloggers"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my first pressure cooker. I had a friend years ago that blew the lid off of her pressure cooker so I was always afraid to use one. Finally gave in and bought the instant pot because Amazon had an amazing price. Glad I bought it. Easy to use, safe and makes all day cooking a thing of the past. Happy customer"
5.0 out of 5 stars,Great for beginning cooks!
4.0 out of 5 stars,"This is an amazing item, not sure how I got by without it. Only negative is the cleaning after use. It does not clean easily and usually requires soaking, ugh! But I do it and it is ready for another use, yea!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This was the best purchase I have made. The Instant Pot is so versatile, I can do almost anything in this pot. I'm a self proclaimed Instant Pot Head.  I use this daily, for one meal or another, if not all. Steaming vegetables is so quick, but it will take time adjusting the times on how you like your food. Trial and error. My favorite fast breakfast, eggs seasoned in small ramekins and 1 minute. WOW."
5.0 out of 5 stars,I absolutely love the instant pot. I have used so many kitchen appliances. I’ve made frozen chicken and it comes out as juicy as if it had been in the crockpot for 8 hours. I have only used the high pressure and sauté modes so I have so much to tap into but so far it’s been awesome. Every dish I have made has come out amazing! This is truly a time saver for busy families. I highly recommend.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"It sat for awhile because I was intimidated, but it's a miracle worker! If you don't have one yet, you need it. Keep Googling for easy recipes, you will eventually get the nerve to open the box:)"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I really love this Instant Pot. Still practicing on different meals, but so simple to do.  You actually can't make a mistake. My Pot roast came out so tender that you could cut it with a fork. My husband loved it.  I bought 2 lbs of kale to see how tender it would cook in my Instant Pot. It came out great. I'm going to cook for the holidays a Pork Butt Roast with sauerkraut, I know this is going to be so delicious. So glad I purchased this time savings Instant Pot.  I've had it only 2 months, and love it."
1.0 out of 5 stars,"After using the cooker just a handful of times since newly-purchased, it now will not close the red pressure valve properly.  Valve must be lifted and held closed manually to seal as unit builds heat, all while trying to avoid steam burn.  One plus is that cooker still performs all of its baby music sounds flawlessly!  Of course, the time window for returns has just passed.  What a disappointment!"
4.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased a “like new” used model from Amazon, via Amazon Warehouse Deals. As it was described “like new” my expectations were high. It arrived a day early (yay!) but in the original Instant Pot packaging- no exterior Amazon box or packing materials/inserts. This irked me. I began opening the box and realized that it was likely never opened before. All of the packaging was intact and the manual and utensils were all in unbroken bags. I was pleasantly surprised and feeling victorious- instead of paying full priced I took a chance on a used model and had saved about fifty bucks.I set it up on the counter and did a test run, as suggested in the manual. Only then did I notice the huge dent in the side. Ugh. I chatted with three different Amazon reps- one was helpful and able to communicate proficiently, the other two were not. While they were happy to start the return process, they couldn’t just ship a replacement out to me as I’d purchased a used model. Again, ugh. This was still not a problem, but I soon grew angry when I discovered that there were no more cheaper priced used models. They were all priced at the same price point as the new model sold by Amazon. At this point I decided to try my hand at some troubleshooting. I easily disassembled the unit and pushed out the dent. It’s not perfect and there is still a little pucker on surface, but it’s much better.Since that minor annoyance I have whipped up some amazing food. Pulled pork (from start up to natural release in about 90 minutes), hard boiled eggs (12 minutes before a cold ice bath), and beef stew (an hour and forty minutes). The food is incredible. I was skeptical and now I’m a believer. I am planning on making some turkey chili tomorrow, and hopefully some homemade stocks sometime soon. I am also eager to try risotto!If not for the hassle of the damage and irritation that was trying to explain my issue to customer service, I’d give the product five stars. Those of you with one- be careful! That sucker dents easily it seems!"

3.0 out of 5 stars,"These pots can be very dangerous.  There are no recalls on the recent models, but there were many a few years ago.  Did not research enough before purchase."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Just got this yesterday and made Chicken Noodle Soup with 4 bone-in thighs.  Great Scott!  It was THE best soup I've made so far.  In 20 minutes I had the best home-made chicken noodle soup.  So fast, easy to clean and not much of a space-hog.  I will be using this almost every day.  So glad I tried this and the sale price was so good it made me buy it.  Love this Instant Pot!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"From Chicken Marsala to cheesecake, this thing does it all. I love that when you are done cooking, you only have one pot left to wash. Tons of recipes are available online. I absolutely love my Instant Pot."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Excited to get my pot. Advertised to give all the accesories: paddle, condensation, steaming rack, soup spoon, measuring cup. But only received condensation and rack...edit: Contacted instantpot and got my materials!!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,made some great tasting meals with this Instant Pot.  I originally bought the 6 QT. model and than  decide to upgrade to the 8QT.  Needed the extra capacity for soups and cooking ribs and the 8QT. does the trick..
5.0 out of 5 stars,Love my insta pot. I do long days at work and it's so easy to come home and throw something yummy in and it be done in a short time frame with little clean up. I can eat healthy as oppose to going out and I love I don't have to remember to thaw out meat. It Cooks frozen chicken in less than 30 and the food taste great. How did I survive without this. Fast shipping amaze product !!!!
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Daughter loves this product. For a busy mother of three and wife, this makes mealtime more enjoyable for her!! She likes it so much I bought one for b myself and am waiting for it to be delivered"
5.0 out of 5 stars,I’m going to donate a couple of food cookers that now are taking up space in my wee kitchen because this pot does it all with ease. Controls on this cooker is intuitive but reading the manual of course is a good idea. It’s easy to clean and saves time cooking.
1.0 out of 5 stars,I would not recommend 3 times my meat was uncooked even with setting on high and extending the amount of time for the slow cooker. I also tried to cook the uncooked meat with pressure setting and it still did not cook. Then it was hard to clean as all the sauce stuck as I had to cook for longer as meat was not cooked. When I read other reviews it seems a lot of people have this issue. I would like someone to follow up on how I can return this product as it is not cooking meat on the slow cooker setting like it advertises.
2.0 out of 5 stars,I am not pleased with this appliance.  It emits so much steam while it is building up pressure........and I have done this multiple times with others watching my steps and sent videos to family to observe steam.......that it leaves water marks on my ten foot ceilings.  I sit it next to my stove air vent and have tried different positions and yet it still emits more steam than what others say theirs do even when releasing pressure.  I am not going to risk my nice ceilings for boiled eggs let alone meals that would leave worse marks when released.  Just cook the old fashioned way and save your ceilings.
2.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought my instant pot 2 years ago. It’s a great machine, but the buttons have slowly stopped working. Originally it was just the reset button. I would have to unplug it to reset the panel. Now it’s the pressure buttons so I can’t cook anything for more than the preset of 35."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I had used a stovetop pressure cooker for 50+ years, but this beats every one I ever had!! Easy to use: doesn't require watching and adjusting the heat; removeable inner pan that is easy to handle and clean; frees up stovetop for other cooking; doesn't heat up the kitchen...and on and on. I love it!!!!!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Let me put it this way:My family has given gifts to my father in law for YEARS, 11 if I recall correctly.  He smiles, but its always a qualified smile, and the gifts are pushed aside within a day.He talks to my wife weekly about how amazing this thing is.It's just that good folks!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"We purchased this item and on the same day of receiving it used it to make BBQ pulled pork. 2 x 2.5 lbs of meat in the pot, seasonings, abut 8 Oz of pepsi. 90 minutes on manual... waited for natural cool down... Walla great and easy to shred with 2 forks, removed fat, added sweet baby rays and dinner was served. About 2 hrs total. Easy to clean stainless steel container. At least 1/2 the time as crock pot to get to same or so to shred. Tasted better since there was less cooking time and texture was better. Will use again this week. Will update in a month or so."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Thought I might try a pressure cooker, and this one got great reviews from many many sources. This is a very versatile timesaver and has expanded our menu in fun ways! Lots of YouTube videos and facebook groups to help you along as you learn to use this (it's easy!) Very happy to have this as part of my kitchen equipment. Looks nice, perfect size. I trust it to be safe."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have wanted an instapot for awhile now and on prime day I made the leap and got it. I have to say I love it so much, it might take me a bit to learn how to work it better but so far I have no complaints. It made boneless ribs perfectly and they just fell apart."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Every household needs an instapot. I really like this model. It's great for things you want to be soft like shredded meats, soups and stews, mashed potatoes. It's good for hard boiled eggs as well."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"The IP may not need another fantastic review but this is my fave. I use most of the functions on a regular basis. Supper after a long day at work doesn't have to take 30+ minutes to prepare, anymore. Cannot recommend this any higher. This replaced my other brand electric pressure cooker and is so much better. So spend the extra dollars because you get what you pay for and this is amazing. This unit is my backup unit if my other cooker is already busy."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This little kitchen gadget has helped my meal prep game. I have been able to get dinner on the table on time, even when the meat is not fully thawed! Love my instant pot! Ribs are my favorite!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,I love the preset features! I am slowly going through each one. My favorite so far is the sous vide and the egg button. I have another larger pressure cooker.... instant pot is far superior I don't have to worry my food is undercooked even living in a higher altitude.
4.0 out of 5 stars,Easy to use. This is my first insta pot. I have made several meals and my family doesn’t seem to enjoy it. The product itself is good. Just not sure that we’re an insta pot family. I’m still trying recipes and hopefully we can find something we like.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"My wife totally screwed up the first meal she attempted and put this on a shelf never to be used again.  Then 2 month later decided to try again and it has not left our kitchen.  Probably prepare 6-8 meals a week.  Super easy and make delicious food.  So buy this, read the instructions, and enjoy a better life."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"Got this beauty for Christmas from my children. What I’m disappointed with is that the owners manual, spoons, and measuring cup was not in the box. Calls to instant pot (in Canada) and emails have gone unanswered."
5.0 out of 5 stars,Wow what an awesome product. I was a bit anxious at its size and all the options. Once I set it up and did my test run I realized what a breeze it is to use and clean.  I love my instant pot and all the wonderful features- my husband doesn’t cook with it but loves it too for all the great meals!
3.0 out of 5 stars,"I received the Instant Pot less than 3 weeks ago.  It worked great the first 3 times I used it.  As of today nothing happens when I plug it in.  I called the support line and have been listening to  ""your call is important..."" for over 10 minutes.  What a frustrating disappointment.  Finally someone answered.  I was told to check the power cord on the back of the unit.  Indeed it had come loose.  When I pushed it back into place the unit lit up.  However, the fit is not tight and this should not happen."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Just received today. The accessories it was supposed to come with were not in box. So disappointed. Accessories included: stainless steel steam rack with handles, rice paddle, Soup Spoon, measuring cup and condensation collector  NONE of theses were in box. Guess I will have to take the time to call Amazon. UgggUPDATE: Amazon fixed problem"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love this Instant Pot.  I already owned the 6 QT and used it all of the time.  I just sometimes wanted to cook more, so this was the obvious choice to me.  Now I use both of them and love both of them. I dont know how I  did without an Instant Pot for so many years!  If you dont own one (or two) I definately recommend them."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"OMG! Best Christmas gift I’ve ever bought myself! I’ve used it every night since it arrived a few weeks ago! Love the ease of use (cooking, clean up, etc) and versatility! Love it so much we purchased an 8 qt also and purchased another 6 qt for a college! Why did I wait so long to try the IP?! Doesn’t matter but I’m glad I’m using it now."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"LIked it so much, that I have 2 now."
5.0 out of 5 stars,Bought this for my myself and never used it. Took it to my daughter in law and she cooked such good meals for us in it I left it with her and bought myself another one! So easy to use and clean.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I got this today and the first thing I made were hard boiled eggs, using the 6 minutes high pressure, 6 minute rest then quick release, then put the eggs in ice water. I was amazed at how well they peeled. I have fresh chicken eggs from my layers, and have not been able to hard boil them on the stove with any luck to peel them. I can't wait to try main dish recipes, I downloaded the great food fast cookbook to my kindle"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"*You can throw together a recipe, set the timer and walk away until it's done.* Add soup ingredients, cook, and puree.*Makes perfectly peel-able, hard boiled eggs, every time.* Make bone broth in 70 minutes* Easy to clean* Meals are tasty, meats are tender, including pork roast.I got rid of my slow cooker and will probably never use my other pressure cooker.Still have been unsuccessful with deserts, but, I'm sure that's just me. I'll have to keep trying."
5.0 out of 5 stars,I bought this as a mothers day gift. She was very happy.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"After my DIL kept bragging on hers and when my crock pot went out I purchased the instapot. Well let me tell you, I cooked a roast in it and it came out tender and juicy.  I was leary about using the pressure pot function since it was my first time. My one complaint is the guide book is not specific about what to do to release the pressure and safely take the lid off. Being a pretty smart  person I knew I had to release the pressure and just waited patiently to take the lid off."
1.0 out of 5 stars,"Extremely flawed. The slow cooker function only works for liquids, chili, stew, etc. but not roasts, etc. Pressure cooker function constantly overheats. Functions and presets have very little explanation and don’t seem to really do anything anyway. DO NOT RECOMMEND"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I wasn't sure if I really needed another small kitchen appliance, but several people had told me I really needed to get an Instant Pot. After hearing again from yet another person, I ordered one. Wow!  I am amazed at everything this pot can do.  I decided to order a non-stick pot with a few other accessories and a cookbook.  I am so looking forward to making many more wonderful meals."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is the BEST! It's easy, fast, and leaves zero excuses for yummy healthy meals.  There are so many recipes that I am excited to try, and this has helped me with making the same 'ole same 'ole all the time. I can't believe the versatility you have with this. I made hard boiled eggs that came out perfect!!  This is definitely not one of those kitchen gadgets you buy, and give up on, or they give up on you!  This one is a keeper!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm changing my review of this product back from 2 star to 5 star because after awhile, manufacturer finally responded to my inquiries about the product malfunctioning when it stopped working. They instead sent me a newer model and I'm happy with that response."
2.0 out of 5 stars,"I love using my 8qt instapot and was so excited at the idea of getting a smaller one that will heat up faster for smaller portioned things like rice or oatmeal, however this one takes longer than the huge one to heat up! Still very useable and practical but just wasn’t quite what I was truly hoping it would be!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have used this 3-7 days a week since learning how to use it.  Great to make home cooked dishes in less time.  Great for busy families.  However, I strongly suggest a good cookbook to get you started. Bob Wardens Slow Food Fast has been a really good one."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought this in February. I washed basket in dishwasher every day, and today basket started to flake from his green  covering;(  so disappointed. lid works perfectly."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have a stove top pressure cooker and debated for a lon g time on getting an electric one. So glad I finally did. This thing is wonderful. Everyone should have one. If all I did was cook hard boiled eggs it would be well worth the price. Never had eggs peel so easily. Ribs, roasts and steamed veggies are better cooked in the instant pot. I will never use all the functions but am more that happy using the ones I do."
5.0 out of 5 stars,Haven't had any issues so far.  It cooks rice really well.  I like that is does not have the non-stick coating.  Our previous one rice cooker did and it got all scratched up and started sticking.  Not fun thinking about what chemicals we may have been eating.
1.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased my instapot in Jan. 2018.  I used it often in preparing meals for my family. Jan 2020 it stopped working, It was giving me an edit CRL and would not turn on anymore, when I called into their customer service the rep asked me when it was purchased and told me it was still under warranty, I took a picture of the back of the unit as directed as well as sent my receipt. I was then emailed and told it was not under warranty so I spent 128.00 on an instapot that lasted 2 years. To expensive for that kind of result. DON'T BUY ONE!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Overall, I really like it.  It reduces cook time for meats or beans, but soups, stews, and sometimes beans can be finicky.  This is not a 100% crock pot replacement.  If food or liquid is too thick or not enough water, it will sense food burn and stop cooking.  Overall, I'd give it an A- for that reason.  We have a large family and use it 2-3 times per week.  Raw meats cook tender, start to finish, in a fraction of the time.  Just be aware that digital speed cooking with pressure comes with some limitations."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I don't know how I ever lived without this!!  I can make a whole bag of potatoes in 12 minutes.  I can make the very best pot of beans... in less time and with much more flavor.  Lentil stew, pasta dishes... it can be used as a pressure cooker, a slow cooker, and you can even make yogurt in here.  There are SO many youtube videos that demonstrate how to use it, so it's not scary.  It is VERY safe.  The safety features put your mind at ease (not your grandma's pressure cooker!)  :)"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"So far, perfect!.  I make chicken stock with baked chicken wings (one hour) and veggies in two more hours.  This usually takes me 6 hours of keeping a simmering pot. Cut my time in half. Ten minute hard boiled eggs, soup-to-nuts. 5 on pressure cook and 5 on natural vent. Ice bath, and no green halo around the yolks.  Perfect every time!  Too many recipes to mention.  I am no longer a doubter."
5.0 out of 5 stars,This is my first pressure cooker and I am glad I purchased this one. The pre-set cooking timers are on point. I've been able to make sticky rice with this and that alone has made the product valuable to me. The first one I ordered never made it my address and there was no issue getting a second shipped out in record time. I definitely recommend getting this especially if it's your first pressure cooker. Fool proof and easy to clean is a plus!!
5.0 out of 5 stars,Wish I had bought this 18 years ago!!!!  Would have saved so much time and energy cooking!!!  I no longer worry about running out of time making last minute dinner.  I probably should get another one so I can make the main course and the rice simultaneously.  Definitely will be my wedding gift purchase for all of my children when they grow up.  Wish someone had thought about giving me one :)
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm still learning how to best use it, but as a weight lifter, I eat a lot of chicken and potatoes, so it cooks up shredded chicken in 30 minutes. Steams my sweet potatoes in 20 minutes. Great buy! We also made traditional Jamaican oxtail in this bad boy for Thanksgiving and it turned out perfect!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Life-changing purchase! I am so glad I bought this. As a full-time working mom with 2 young kids and super busy husband, this is a life-saver! I love making various bean stews and healthy dishes in this instant pot and then storing left overs for later! LOVE IT!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I was a bit nervous to try this out the first time, and a little overwhelmed, since I've never used a pressure cooker before, but like most people have said, this is a game changer!  The settings on my crockpot just were not cutting it, and things were getting overcooked even on the low or stay warm setting, so it was time for a change.  I followed the instructions for the initial steam clean and am glad I did, so I could get comfortable.  The pressurizing takes some time, but you really just need to let it do its thing.  I really like that the pot has a chime feature indicating when the lid is on and locked, although that might get annoying after I've used it a few times.  There is a setting to deactivate it in the instructions.  My first recipe was Michelle Tam's Kalua pork with cabbage and it did not disappoint!  I loved everything about the Insta-Pot.  The food turned out spectacularly, was so easy to clean, and I cannot wait to try all the other functions."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought this on a whim when is was a deal of the day and I'm so glad I do it.  It sat in the box for 2 months before I even bothered to take it out and try it.  It wasn't that complicated to figure out and works great.  I made some excellent ""refried"" beans and a delicious beef stew.  I ate the best ham I've ever eaten that my friend cooked in one just like it.  It's easy enough to use once you get the hang of it and timing down.  Oh...also, husband says best rice cooker he ever used...also makes venison very tender."
5.0 out of 5 stars,Love my Instant Pot so far.  Instruction videos online made this easier to use though the written instructions are nice as well.  Made a 2.25lb Beef Chuck roast first day in 55 minutes and it was super tender and delicious.  Sautéed to brown the meat for 10 minutes and 45 minutes for pressure cooking. Looking forward to using more features soon.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Did not want to write review until after I used it a few times. Once you get the hang of it-fantastic. Made bbq ribs-chicken at same time. The meat fell off the bone tender. Used combo of my favorite 2 ssuces and some orange juice, the entire family loved loved loved them. Cooks sooo fast and sooo easy to use. Almost no time in prep work, then just push the preprogram setting. Had to cover vent with folded paper towel when releasing pressure and excess moisture."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"So far so good!  Glad we got the 8 qt instead of the 6.  Best thing so far is really quick and rich chicken stock. Also good quick dry beans, and pressure cooked pot roast. Still trying to figure out perfect soft boiled eggs, but I will say, pressure cooked eggs sure do peel easy."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Of course, I have no regrets! I've used it several times already. There is a learning curve, but nothing too drastic. Everything is cooked just how I want it, with only a little trial and error due to the recipes I've followed. I'm so happy with my purchase! I do find that I like some things better in the oven, but this has practically replaced my slow cooker. I meal prep and it's an amazing time saver."
2.0 out of 5 stars,"The pressure pin (small metallic pin) leaks pressure, when the pot is in a sealed position. It does not go up automatically, you can only try to fix it manually. But this is not you are supposed to do with this pot. You can burn yourself while doing it."
1.0 out of 5 stars,"I ordered this for my new kitchen I am having installed, but the instapot arrived so badly damaged, that it is completely unusable. Sadly, I opened my box too late to return it. So, now I get to eat the expense, but not any food from my expensive pot."
5.0 out of 5 stars,This is a Godsend. My husband has to cook all our meals and we forget to take out our meat in time to thaw. We are eating.less fast food.
5.0 out of 5 stars,This is my favorite appliance in my kitchen right along with my air fryer. This instant pot does everything! It makes the best pork ribs i've ever eaten. Great for hard boiled eggs. So many options with this. I can't believe I ever survived without it.
4.0 out of 5 stars,It works just fine. The hard part is learning to put on the pressure lid  takes lots of tries to master it.
5.0 out of 5 stars,Already had the lux model. Decided to get the duo model because of the yogurt button that can be used to make yogurt and to proof bread dough in. Absolutely recommend this model! I also highly recommend the lux model! Love them both! use them both at least three or four times a week!!
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I like this pot very well, so far have cooked some excellent meals in it.  It is easy to use and there are many recipes included with the pot and I also purchased a recipe book separate from it so that I had even more ways of using it.  Everything has turned out delicious so far."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"love our Instapot! we have made soups, rice, yogurt and even jam! safes so much time in the kitchen! and love that it has a fire risk alarm as it saved us one time we forgot to add water to the potatoes we wanted to bake!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,Very happy with the results when using it to air fry food. It tasted like it was fried. didn't need to buy a separate air fryer as this worked good with instant pot.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Excellent cooking tool. This thing rocks. Easy to learn steps for pressure cooking, or any of the functions. I’m hooked. I was able to get a great deal on Prime Day, and I’m so glad I got it! And, I’ve found many good recipes online for it."
4.0 out of 5 stars,It works good. I have tried several items and the only thing that I have adjusted is the cook time. I think it's because I live at a high elevation. I have had good tasting food that was crunchy just as I had hoped.
4.0 out of 5 stars,My only complaint is that the main cooking pot is warped. It’s rounded up in middle so when you sauté the heat is more on the edges of the pot so things can’t cook evenly
5.0 out of 5 stars,One of the best inventions ever. They could put a better pressure knob on them though. Mine is very loose and sometimes I don't realize it isn't under pressure until I smell what is cooking or see the steam. But ok product.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love it when I don't have to baby my food while it cooks. I can forget that I'm cooking at all or use this overnight, without a potential fire hazard. Am also discovering many new recipes that would be impractical to make without the yogurt function."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"So far, I have made beans (red beans, chick peas, white beans), rice, soups, pot roast and cassoulet - white beans with halved plum tomatoes and lamb chops with lots of garlic, herbs, and spices - perfect on a cold January night!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love it! Purchasing an Instant Pot and joining Facebook groups for tips and recipes have made cooking fun again. This model has all the features I need, and the size works well for my family of three. I do recommend reading the manual and performing the water test before you start cooking."
5.0 out of 5 stars,I seldom write reviews but this Instant Pot is so awesome and versatile. Since I've had it I've cooked every dinner in it. It works so well with Indian dishes that require long cooking too provide flavor and break down meats in a fraction of the time. I do though have to get used to the start up time for pressure cooking and the release time.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Instant Pot replaced my other pressure/slow cooker device that stop heating properly after 8 years of use. Instant Pot is a much better product, so far, and I am very happy with the ways I have used it. Does take a bit of adapting to coming from a different brand."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"Its is very convenience to cook soup, however. If I cook stew that the meat will became too tendered which had no texture.....but it is still a good product since I don't have to watch it as cook on the gas stove~"
5.0 out of 5 stars,Works great! I am enjoying the versatility this adds to my instant pot!
5.0 out of 5 stars,Great Product.  Very easy to clean and smart.
5.0 out of 5 stars,Got this for my boyfriend for christmas since his rice cooker was slowly dying. What a great way to get him to cook more! He's made marbles eggs and cajun rice so far which all turned out wonderfully.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"You won't be disappointed.Get one for hard boiled eggs alone, they're perfect. Risotto is delicious and perfect. Salmon, shredded chicken breast, tomato soup, all top notch. Quick ribs! Finish them on the grill or the broiler with your favorite sauce."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"this has revolutionized family dinners for us. We can cook a week's worth of meatballs in 30 minutes. Also great for pasta, stews, hardboiled eggs, Indian food, and a bunch of kid-friendly dishes. Once you get the hang of using it, and taking into account the amount of time the machine will need to get up to pressure and then release, it is super easy. Also love that unlike my slow cooker, it allows you to saute in the pot so you're not getting other dishes dirty in the ""prep"" process."
4.0 out of 5 stars,It's way better than a Crock-Pot it Cooks so fast and Cooks nearly the same as a crock pot too just less time. The first time you use it the steam blow off can be startling be careful what's directly above it if you decide to turn the release lever.
4.0 out of 5 stars,"I had heard a lot about pressure cookers so I thought I would get one.  WOW, it really does cook your meal in the time that you heard.  It can take longer to build and release pressure that you might expect.  That's OK, just gives you time to get the table ready."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I LOVE this thing! I recently started food prepping to make weeknights easier & this IP is great! With the sauté feature I love that I can basically use one pot to prepare a whole meal! Don't wait to buy one if you're on the fence about it! And don't be intimidated by it & let it sit in the box! Clean up is a breeze with the stainless steel pot, and there are literally tons of recipes out there on the web & Pinterest to be creative! Love, love, love mine & wish I'd bought one sooner! I've steamed vegetables, cooked yams, chicken & frozen chicken breasts, made a yummy corned beef roast, delicious beef tips, chicken curry... I have the 8 qt Duo, and I can't praise it enough!!"
4.0 out of 5 stars,"I have been using pressure cookers all my life, this by far is my favorite. I like that it can cook for longer periods of time, compared to a stove top pressure cooker because the temperature is regulated, I can make great pulled pork or italian beef in 3 hours instead of 8-10. I also love to make brown rice, it was such a pain making it on the stove, 20 min compared to an hour of constantly stirring and watching. My only complaint is the ring the lid screws in is hard to clean. Other than that great."
5.0 out of 5 stars,everything I cook comes out great and its done in no time.  eggs come right out of the shell when they get hardboiled and they are perfect.  veggies are done in like 2 minutes.  I tried rice and it was the best rice I ever had. potatoes in the skin were great. ive only had it a couple of days I will try a pot roast tomorrow. I cant praise it enough I am sorry I waited so long to get one
2.0 out of 5 stars,"For 2 months, it worked well and made great chili and soup.  One day I plugged it in and it didn't light up!  Yeah, this happens, instant electronic failure is to be expected on occasion.  But I can't replace it at my pre-Xmas powerhouse price.  Do I battle the system?  Or suck it up and buy a new one at the higher price?  It was a good product... but I'm still debating my next step.  Hope you have better luck.  It might be worth it to buy the insurance!"
4.0 out of 5 stars,"I haven't used all the functions yet, but am finding this to be less than hoped for. The ""saute"" function, which I tried to use before pressure cooking some meat, was barely hot enough to accomplish a good browning. The slow-cooker was not effective. On ""low"" it didn't cook at all. The pressure cooker does work okay. Since I got this primarily to replace my worn-out pressure cooker, I am satisfied. As I use more functions I will update my review."
1.0 out of 5 stars,Mine just broke after 15 months...  good otherwise.  Cheaper Costco version still running after 3yrs
1.0 out of 5 stars,"It worked well for a while, and after a year with using it only once every 2-3 weeks to cook a soup it stared leaking when under the high pressure emptying the contents of the pot in very fast way. If somebody happens to be close to the instapot risks to get burned. Liquid boiling under high pressure is very, very hot. If it’s close to the electrical outlet there is a possibility to get electrocuted."
1.0 out of 5 stars,"We had heard great things about this product but must have gotten a lemon because the two recipes we have tried from the booklet it came with burned in the pressure cooker mode. After the food came up to steam the warning code said ""Food Burn"". We added liquid but as soon as it got to steam again it had the same warning, so we were not able to complete either recipe. Apparently the heating element is inaccurate and overheating. Sadly our return window is expired by 5 days so I guess we are out of luck."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is the most versatile kitchen appliance I've ever owned.  Having the ability to saute vegetables and brown meats, then slow-cook or pressure-cook all in the same pan is a huge time saver.  It's very easy to use and eliminates much of the guesswork of a stove-top pressure cooker.  I have used this 3-4 times a week since it arrived and that will likely increase as I learn new recipes.  I bought one for myself and another as a gift.  Very happy that I did!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love this thing, and when you put it on low saute you can walk away, it won't burn, the fan was just cool and say hot then when it cools it will start heating again, even a bachelor can cook with this thing."
1.0 out of 5 stars,I was really excited to use instapot but unfortunately I wasn’t able to. It tripped the power in my house and became unuseable. We use 220 volts in this part of the world and the instapot that was shipped to me was 110 volts. I wrongly assumed that the product being sent o a country that uses 229 volts would be 220 volts. My mistake?
5.0 out of 5 stars,I purchased this a little over a month ago and I've faithfully used it at least 4 times a week. It is easy to use and a very practical kitchen piece.  I can't figure out why I waited so long to buy one.Every recipe we've tried has turned out well and even my pickiest teen has been helping cook meals that she loves.I would whole heartedly recommend this to anyone who wants wholesome meals and doesn't have tons of time to spend cooking.
2.0 out of 5 stars,Love the product but it only lasted for 19 months. Disappointed! I use it all the time and even gifted it to people but the other day we were cooking and all of a sudden it just turned off and wouldn’t turn back on. Hoping their customer service is helpful.
5.0 out of 5 stars,We use it a lot and we bought a recipe book that is great. It is easy to clean. The inner pot is very high quality. Thick and heavy duty. You can brown the meat before cooking right in the pot. This does not require a lot of liquid like some others. I have cooked with only 1/2 cup of liquid. I have also cooked with some tomato sauce and no other liquid. I cooked a 5lb turkey breast in 45 minutes. I crisped the skin under the broiler in the oven for 10 minutes afterward. It came out juicy and delicious.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I don’t use it to its full potential, but I really like it for one pot meals.  I’m not the best cook and don’t enjoy cooking.  This think makes meal prep and clean up much easier.  It’s a great time saver.  I would recommend this product."
1.0 out of 5 stars,"Worst Kitchen appliance I’ve ever owned. Every time I use this and follow the instructions and recipes to a T, it burns halfway through cooking and I’m left with a hard to clean pot And ruined meat.  So lots of money lost and no meals have been cooked.  Do not buy this product. I’ll go back to a crockpot any day over this"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"We had a stove top pressure cooker that jammed and made my kitchen a complete mess. Now after owning this for a year and using it many times, we've given that to recycling and use this at least 1x per week. Have made a variety of things from, soups, to stews to flan to rice to you get the idea,  it is a very useful item particularly in a small kitchen."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have had this pot for a little over a week now and I have yet to take it off my counter.  I have used it every day.  I LOVE IT! Its easy to clean and use.  I especially appreciate how much safer it is to pressure cook my foods.Update: One year later, I still use my Instant Pot every day.  I am saving an average of $40 a month in electricity because I am using my stove and oven much less.  I have made everything from bone broth to cheesecake.  I even bought a 2nd Instant Pot.  Make sure to join their Facebook page.  Lots of helpful members and recipes."
5.0 out of 5 stars,Best investment of the year so far! I'm very pleased with my purchase. I use it primarily to make bone broth and soup. It is perfect for this. Everything I've made in it tastes so much more flavorful than the slower methods I have used in the past. This pot really does retain the nutrients as it claims to do and takes a fraction of the time. Buy it. You'll like it.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"How have I been living without this miracle appliance all my life???  The Instant Pot is a game changer in our house with 4 small children.  No more cooking on a stovetop while two kids fight in the background and the other littles are climbing my legs in danger of boiling hot liquids burning their skin.  Now I just throw the ingredients in, set the time, and go enjoy life by playing a game or reading a book with my kids.  Best Christmas present ever!!!!!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,This is my first instant pot. I was surprised how easy it was to understand it's function to operate. At first I had to do some hit and trial to understand the exact pressure time for my cooking. It's been months and have no issue with this product.  I have cooked so many things. I make plain yogurt every week and this is the life saver for me.
4.0 out of 5 stars,"Works as advertised, really does do a great job cooking food though the size of batches leaves much to be desired."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"It should be called magic pot. Coming from using a stove top pressure cooker and fuzzy logic rice cooker, we absolutely love this pressure cooker. I'm really amazed at this as it looks like a combo of the rice cooker and pressure cooker. We usually make lentil soup by adding all ingredients without sauteing with this, starting the program at night and in the morning we wake up to the wonderful aroma of lentils. There are no spills or splatters because of the slow release feature of the pressure cooker. We have not yet cooked meat in this but I do see making some juicy moist meat and fried rice in this pretty soon. Also do look up recipe videos on youtube for interesting food ideas."
2.0 out of 5 stars,"i actually went and got another one from a retail store and it has the same problemrandomly wont seal and achieve pressure (more towards the ""wont"" than towards the ""does"")my procrastination and thinking i could figure it out myself has led to me having it past the time of returning.back to a crock pot."
1.0 out of 5 stars,"I can't tell you if it is or isn't a good product. Bottom was busted out of the box, I didn't get to use it smelled liked awful. Returned"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is a great product.  It is fairly simple to use but you do need to read the instructions very carefully to make sure you do not bypass a safety function.  However, if you follow all the instructions, you can get some great meals from it.  My wife really loves it and has given up using her old pressure cooker.  It even has a recipe for making a cheese cake using steam.  There was only one dish that my wife has made using the cookbook that we decided does not need to be made again and that was oatmeal.  That is more of a function of our personal taste.  Other people may like it."
5.0 out of 5 stars,I absolutely love the air fryer lid and it’s a must have for our family! It’s easy to use and the food tastes amazing. From broiling to dehydrating there’s nothing you can’t make with your instant pot now! With the divider tray I made over 20 wings at once just switching top to bottom in between .
5.0 out of 5 stars,Bought this because of the good reviews and because I am lazy when it comes to cooking.It was also $50 off on black friday.So far I made beef stew and stuffed cabbage.I converted my mom's recipes to a more modern way of cooking.Wow! The beef stew turned out perfect and so did the stuffed cabbage.My mom  would always add Hillshire Farms polish keilbassi to the pot and they soaked up all that flavor.The stuffed cabbage alone was worth the price.It turned out perfect.My mom died 2 years ago but made sure we had her recipes.My dad got choked up when he ate my stuffed cabbage from my instant pot.Tasted like moms.Little things like these can make a world of difference.Round three???? Mom's chilli.
1.0 out of 5 stars,"The product seems great, but the page the item was advertised on said it was $79.95 -- but when I checked out, the charge was $99.95!  A twenty dollar overcharge!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have owned my instant pot for over 3 years.  I find that I use it more and more.Can't say how much I like being able to take a completely frozen roast out of the freezer, toss it in; in a little over an hour we have a healthy dinner made.The cheesecakes are amazing.I have stored my rice cooker, yogurt maker and haven't used one of my slow cookers in over a year."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"It is big, ugly, and cost as much (even on sale) as my instant pot did.  However, it seems to work great.  I’ve used it a lot to cook veggies that I normally wouldn’t eat if not grilled or fried (sweet potatoes, brussell sprouts, broccoli, egg plant, etc.) and for salmon."
1.0 out of 5 stars,"The value never gets to pressure.  I have to pull the valve manually I. Order for it to pressurize.  Frustrating that has become a dust collector.  I even returned 1 and the 2nd is the same thing.  Useless,"
1.0 out of 5 stars,"The pressure cooker part of this has stopped working.  You turn the nob to release steam or to stop the steam for it to build up pressure. Doesn't matter what we do, steam keeps coming out.  So after a year of use its just a crock pot now.  Went to see how much the lid would cost to replace it and its more that half the price of instant pot.  We used to use it about 3 times a week."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my third pressure cooker, but my first Electronis pressure. I could have said I'll never go back to the stovetop again, but just a few days ago I had the electronic cooker going on the counter, and the Fagor going on the stove. So I think that I'm going to be throwing out my stovetop.I have been giving away things like rice cooker, slow cooker, and a few other ""Clutter Bugs"" though.There is no dought that Instant Pot is a Keeper."
1.0 out of 5 stars,I had this less than a week got error code would t work. I hear they have e good customer support you have to with this junk!! I didnt bother messing replacement just returned.
5.0 out of 5 stars,Easy to clean. Works good. Except I can't seem to not burn my potatoes. Lol. Cool thing is it beeps and says burn food burn food every time. Operator error i guess.Works good though
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Easy, fast, and quiet. I find myself using it several times a week. Cooks rice and steel cut oats to perfection. Add rice, add water, close, lid, make sure valve is on pressure, push rice button - done!!  Chicken stew was also fabulous. Am looking for more recipes for this fabulous pot.  Took me a little while to be comfortable with using it but it solves the problem of needing nutritious, healthy, and fast.  By the way, I love the high quality inner pot and the lid is very sturdy.  Wish it came with a steamer basket (in addition to the rack)."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I use it a lot to make hard-boiled eggs, set it for 6 minutes and go get ready for work..Also experimented and cooked a frozen bacon-wrapped steak and it turned out better than expected"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Don't know how I lived without this for so long! I make dog food for 2 of our dogs (we have 5!) and it is so much quicker in this. Love having the inner pot stainless so I can use my immersion blender right in it without worrying about scratching. It makes potatoes great and fast! Still working on the vegetables, first time came out great, second time I did different ones and they were a little too mushy. Just need to adjust the time. I highly recommend this pot!!!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,Wasn’t sure I would like it but I do. I read manual online and watched lots of videos b4 I got it and have used it nearly every day for 3 weeks to get into good and safe practices . It doesn’t take as much room as I thought. Definitely a good purchase
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought this to can tomatoes with and it worked well enough, but soon I tried a couple dishes I saw on the internet in it and wow did they turn out great. Loved it so much I bought one for my parents."
4.0 out of 5 stars,Good for many meals but it does not brown the meat. You may need to brown some dishes in the over after cooking in this pressure cooker. I would recommend looking at a cooker that also has a browning lid.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This machine is life changing!!!!  I can makes beans and baby back ribs in under an hour!  No preplanning needed!  In the past, when I decided I wanted to make black beans, I could only do so if I remember to plan in advance. Now I can have a nice pot of black beans in 30 minutes with no presoaking!  Ribs taste like they've been smoked for hours and just fall off the bone!  Best thing I've bought in years!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I absolutely love the instant pot. I can cook chicken breasts from frozen in 8 minutes.  The food comes out perfect.  Meat is always tender and cooked perfectly.  It is so much more than a pressure cooker, you can you it as a slower cooker and a rice cooker as well.  If you need to saute or brown things before cooking this will do that too.  Clean tp is a breeze with just one pot to clean.  Perfect fro the busy family who is constantly cooking last minute meals.  Highly recommend this to anyone who wants to save time and money!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,Having a lot of fun making chili (cooking with the dry beans I make in this first)  lava cakes and apple oatmeal. Returned competitors item and got this because of the heavy stainless inner pot. Doesn’t always cook faster when you factor in pressuring and steam release times but the results are worth the investment and food is super yummy. Easy to use after reading instructions.
4.0 out of 5 stars,Doesn’t come with clear times for side’s or even the cooking time for whole me like chicken or Mexican give us the sautéed onions time then pressure cooker in instant pot cooker
5.0 out of 5 stars,I love how easy to use it is. My only grudge is that it takes up so much space to have two lids for the j start pot but we love how well it works!!
4.0 out of 5 stars,I received the product. It comes with a soup ladle and a rice spoon. It also comes with a measuring cup. Our measuring cup was cracked inside the pot. It's really disappointing to get something brand new and an element in it was broken. Hoping that the unit itself works when we use it this weekend.
5.0 out of 5 stars,This is seriously the best kitchen appliance I've ever purchased! It is so easy to use and makes everyday cooking fast and SO easy. I used to dislike cooking brown rice but with the instant pot it  comes out soft and fluffy. And it takes half the time. It's also easier to eat healthier now too because I can meal prep a bunch of healthy food for the whole week. It's a lifesaver and I highly recommend it!
5.0 out of 5 stars,"We have made gumbo, chili, garlic chicken & rice, and pork carnitas. This is a great kitchen tool. We forgot to close the vent on one dish and it gave us a “burning” warning before anything actually burned and the dish was saved!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm so glad I finally bought one. I still can't believe how much time it saves, and it really does live up to its promises. Next up: Instant Pot Coq au Vin!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I’ve been on the fence about buying an instant pot for year.  I gave in for cyber Monday and am so happy I did.  Yes it’s another appliance but it does so much!  You can cook frozen food in minutes - so helpful especially when I forget to defrost before I leave for work.  The instant pot doesn’t do crispy well but the fix is easy, throw the fully cooked item under the broiler for a couple minutes."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"can't praise this thing enough- use it all the time, makes life much easier"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"As usual, the Instant Pot is super!  I already had one I was using, but wanted a second one for my RV, so that when we travel I can use it.  It was on sale for Prime Day and I took advantage of the good deal.  Thanks Instant Pot!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"We got this as a gift from our daughters for Christmas. It really is far more versatile than a stand-alone pressure cooker pot used on stoves. The hard part is figuring out the buttons, timer, etc. A small learning curve for some who will use this pot on a regular basis."
5.0 out of 5 stars,Love pressure cooking and InstaPot is the best.  Got this on a special sale which made the deal unable to resist.  Only issue is the smell of the top's silicon ring.  Causes a lot of negative feedback from family members.  Have to keep InstaPot outside.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I use this everyday. I love the"" one potness"" of it. There is a learning curve, but if you follow recipes and look at the comments, it has been really a wonderful gadget. I do recommend getting extra sealing rings as mine took up the flavors of anything spicy. So I have one for sweet, one neutral and one spicy."
1.0 out of 5 stars,This is one of the least intuitive appliances I've owned. ( I can run farm equipment without a problem)  I have to get the manual out every time I use it and still end up needing to re-start. It's so frustrating that I rarely use it.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Gave this to my daughter for Christmas.  She has been having a great time trying out new recipes and she and her family are very pleased with the results.  For anyone else who has this Instant Pot, there is a FB community you can check out for recipe sharing.  There are a lot of recipes online and on Pinterest."
1.0 out of 5 stars,I am not a fan of the instant pot.  Too big to store in my small apt.  Plus I had trouble with 2 of them that the manual release did not work.  I will stick to the crock pot.
5.0 out of 5 stars,I got this as a gift for my daughter. She raves about it and uses it quite regularly. She has tried recipes she has never made before and they have turned out excellent.
5.0 out of 5 stars,I admit I bought this for the air frying capability. So far I have cooked fries (which came out excellent) and chicken tenders (also came out perfect). Very easy to figure out times. Very Happy with purchase
1.0 out of 5 stars,"This broke after a few uses. I bought it dented, but assumed it was in fine working order. It’s not as quick as I was led to believe and the slow cooker function wasn’t great. Not the miracle device I was led to believe it would be."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Who doesn't love these things?  I never much liked yogurt until I made my own in my instant pot DUO.  SOOO creamy and good!  Fast to cook even frozen meats and so worry free.  Just put the stuff in, set it and go."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Personally have only used this for yogurt several times already, it's perfect! My mother has used it a crab boil and the potatoes turned to mush, but that was just us trying to figure out correct settings for such a thing!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,How have I lived so long without this. I honestly don't want to think of the days before my instapot. I love the versatility and ease of use. The best overall feature is that it saves time. We use ours daily and I wish I had this when I was a young working mom.
5.0 out of 5 stars,Wish I'd had this 35 years ago when I was working full time and traveling a lot. But I have it now and it's wonderful. I would suggest buying an IP cookbook for instructions because the materials are not well written or well illustrated.
5.0 out of 5 stars,I'm so in love with this pot it is perfect for a family with not alot of time to have home cooked meals.it is amazing everything you can do with this pot from beansoups steamed veggies and even bake a cake .
1.0 out of 5 stars,"This instant pot Should be called a never pot. Every time I try to use it, it shuts off and says bunt food. This is a crappy pot. I wish I would have never bought it."
2.0 out of 5 stars,Dissapointed. After a couple of uses the seal didnt hold very well. While it was building pressure the steam would leak so I would push down on the lid until it sealed. Food started coming out undercooked even though I used the exact same settings as in the past. I plan on replacing it with a different brand. I only had it for about a year and used it a couple times a month.
5.0 out of 5 stars,Heard about all the hype on these instant pots. Decided to take the leap and order one. Very simple to use. Really enjoyed all the safety features. I am not a cook. But this is taking me to the next level to begin to enjoy preparing healthy simple meals.
5.0 out of 5 stars,This thing is a life saver for a busy family that has a tendency to forget to thaw food early. So many great recipes available online.. and food can be cooked from frozen in a pinch.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"STOP LOOKING AND THINKING - BUY IT!  All the hype is absolutely true.  Don't even bother reading reviews any longer, buy it immediately.  It's essentially the equivalent in kitchen revolution of the microwave.  The stainless pot is super easy to clean, too, and the pressure functions are ridiculously convenient (as opposed to a true pressure cooker)"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"My wife liked her so much I bought one for a friend who just bought a new home.  My only very minor disappointment is that sometimes smells can linger on the unit from what's been cooked last.  However the smell has never been transferred into the next dish, just the lid and steam vent."
5.0 out of 5 stars,I love this! I bought 2 of them. One I got on sale on Prime Day for an amazing price! With two I can cook meat in one and veggies in the other. Or if I am making yogurt which takes many hours then I have another free to make meals. I can't say enough about how easy this product is to use. Plus there are tons of websites that dedicate pages and pages of recipes to cooking in an Instant Pot. Hard boiled eggs in the Instant Pot are so easy to peel its ridiculous! I eat tons of eggs and I always dreaded peeling them but I don't have that problem anymore. I am going to buy a few extra sealing rings just in case the ones that come in the pot begin to wear out. So far the rings have held up wonderfully but I know they won't last forever.
4.0 out of 5 stars,The included guide/cookbook is inconsistent about stating the amount of water/cooking time or amount of ingredient to use.  Most of the recipes are okay though.  But this is frustrating for a beginning cook for whom I bought this.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is one of those purchases that makes you think, How did I ever live without this? It almost does the cooking for you. If you are a bean and grain eater, this is for you! You do not have to presoak beans. They take 30 minutes from dry! Even those pesky dry chic peas that take hours to boil. Cook unsoaked, from dry in 35 minutes!! Unbelievable! It certainly helps me and my family eat healthier, faster! Brown rice, barley, faro - you name it. It cooks it, and fast! Soups, stews, veggies!Great product- can't say enough about it. There is even a facebook page for Instant Pot users! If you are contemplating it- Definitely go for it! Super easy to use and clean!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I really love this thing!!!  I was initially very intimidated by it.  However, began using it to cook pot roast.  Amazing!!!  I am now using it for all sorts of different recipes and it is so simple to use the initimidation quickly dissipated.  The meat is tender and full of flavor.  It makes it quickly, even if I forget to get it out of the freezer ahead of time.  I still have a list of things I want to attempt with mine, including yogurt!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,We use this about 2x a week
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Several of my friends were saying how much they liked their Instant Pot, so I finally bought one.  I made beef stew for my ""first"" use of my new Instant Pot.  I was surprised how quickly the stew was done.  The meat was tender & the vegetables had perfect texture.  Great product.  Highly recommended."
1.0 out of 5 stars,This is my 2nd instant pot. I’ve only had it 5 weeks and the lid doesn’t seal anymore and it leaks water and steam from the back and out the seams. Big disappointment. It only has a one month return window so I’m stuck with a faulty kitchen gadget to just toss out.
5.0 out of 5 stars,My spouse was pushing me to buy this for a while. Black friday is the time and Amazon had excellent deal. Now it has been more than three weeks and everything is great. I wont tell more about the appliance as it is becoming universal. Go and get one and you would love the convenience it bring to you. Next idea to Instant pot - integrate it with Alexa and we can turn it on from work before we leave for home to get to dinner table early ;)
1.0 out of 5 stars,"I mostly bought it for making rice. However, because, the pot is made out of steal, all the rices sticks to the bottom. In addition, the rice it makes is so sticky. It's far away from a well-made rice.The yogurt program is just a joke. You have to do all the stuff by yourself. It only boils the milk for you, which can easily be done by putting your milk on the stove.I used slow cooker to make a curry. It almost did nothing to the food. It just kept it a bit warm for many hours, while I put it on the max heat."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Works like a dream. Made excellent vegan cream of zucchini soup by cooking all ingredients together then blending in a blender. Simple, healthy. Made great jasmine brown rice, and also black beans. Thrilled! Much better than using a stove top pressure cooker - simpler to navigate, and peace of mind instead of babysitting the steam valve with a traditional pot. Far better than a Crockpot, which uses more electricity and takes so much longer to cook, with no variations in settings."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I made dinner in 20 minutes. So fast! It took watching a video online for me to know how to put the lid on correctly, but once I did..... great food!"
4.0 out of 5 stars,"Love the product.  The lid is a hassle.  It makes the cute noise when it is closed but it also makes it when it is closed improperly.  Even though there is an indicator to line it up, it does not work very well.  So, the instant pop makes constant digital chimes indicating it is closed properly but it is not (therefore it won't turn on).  Very annoying.Other than that, made tender stew from chuck meat in 30 minutes on pressure.  Wish it had a clamp down feature for safety.  Heard some horror stories recently about pressure cookers and the little song it sings obviously is not an accurate safety feature.Ribs were okay based on some youtube recipes but will try again in hopes for something for tender."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought this cooker for my wife for Christmas and it was a huge hit! She absolutely loves it. I did some research on them and found that this was rats the best out of all the electric pressure cookers. It was definitely worth the few extra bucks than the other brands. This comes with a nice stainless steel pot instead of the kind with the non stick coating so you don't have to worry about the coating coming off over time. She has used it so much and has tried all different kinds of foods. Frozen wings cooked in about 15 minutes and they were ""fall off the bone"" tender and juicy. She's made lasagna, stew, chicken legs and rice just to name a few and it is absolutely amazing how fast everything cooks and how tender and juicy the meats are.Have recommended this to several family and friends and sounds like they are purchasing one also. This has become the main cooking tool in our kitchen right now and she has not been disappointed one bit."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"New kitchen tech is always a little intimating for me.  But did my first meal the same day I got it and been a convert ever since.  Fast and straight forward.Two notes:  1) Pot size is smaller than I anticipated.  But learning to work with it.2). That leads to my second point, not many recipes out there for Mini IPs."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"My best investment till date. I can cook so many thing in the IP. I am an Indian and I can cook plethora of things in IP. It's fast and cook things instantly. I have cooked rice, chicken, mutton, normal dishes, sauteed dishes. I would totally recommend this."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This was a gift for my parents. Funny enough, their crockpot bit the dust the day before we gave them their present. I had forgotten this has a slow cooker function, but Mom knew right away! She’s been using it nonstop since Christmas. They gave me mine last year so it was fun to gift them the same item."
3.0 out of 5 stars,"While this takes away the need for yet another kitchen appliance, the two tiered design is not efficient. Things cook at different speeds, and it is not ideal to remove the top layer of food, then try to remove the hot metal layer in order to reach the food on the bottom to flip halfway through cooking. Also took 30+ minutes for fries.I ended up returning the lid and buying the vortex air fryer and I am 100% happier."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love this thing!!  It does it all!!  I’ve especially enjoyed making my own yogurt in it. Also, I buy fresh from the farm eggs and I love how Its so easy to hard boil eggs in the IP and then the shells just slide right off!  It’s neat how you can sauté, then boil, then slow cook the same dish all in the same pot!!!  Lots and lots of neat things about this appliance. So glad I bought it!!"
3.0 out of 5 stars,I bought my instant pot 28 days before it broke.  I bought 3extra seals because everyone warned about older issues on seals.  When my pot wouldn't seal I tried a new one.  I tried all my new ones.  Pot worked great for 6 uses.  I loved it.  But then it stopped working.  I am returning it.  I don't know if I will buy another of this brand.
4.0 out of 5 stars,"First time using it today and I’m in love!! No mess in the kitchen, don’t have to clean up the stove after cooking! Pressure cooker my meat to tender goodness. :) Knocked off 1 star because it didn’t come w/ a lid so I can store away in the fridge after but all in all an amazing product! Can’t wait to cook more dishes in it!!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Wow is all I can say. Great price, Great product high quality. Everyone should have one of these in their kitchen. It saves so much time. I made a Beef pot roast in one hour and the potatoes and meat were well done as if I had slow cooked them all day. This is great for working moms who have very little time. This 8 quart instant pot is best for larger families."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Instant Pots are a life changer for those with too little time to cook. As a vegan, I wanted something to allow me to make my own food in a reasonable amount of time while at work. This was it. I can make beans, grains, soups, chilis, and other meals in an hour or less from scratch. Just as vital as my Vitamix now. I will never live without one. Looking forward to experimenting with the yogurt function too."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I am in love!! This is actually this best appliance I’ve ever bought!Arrived early, package in good shape, true description, pricing was awesome!!!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love my Instant Pot.  One of my best friends bought it for me for Christmas.  I can make soup that would take all day to simmer in less than an hour.  I have made a frozen chicken dinner and soup after working 13 hours and being able to do that allows us to eat healthier.  I made caramel.  and most recipes required boiling the can of sweet and condensed milk 6 hours or more.  Was really quick in the instant pot.  I made yogurt but it had too much curd and sourness for my liking, but was really cool to have the ability to make it.  I really love it for veggies too.  There is a instant pot site on Facebook and people are always posting recipes and their great discoveries.  As a person who loves to cook, i recommend this product for it's time saving factors and one pot meals."
1.0 out of 5 stars,Less than 1 year old and got a code and flashing lights. Tried contacting company on their website. After 2 tickets no reply from them. Buyer beware. I love the instant pot but and so disappointed in their lack of response. If you do purchase get the extended warranty.
2.0 out of 5 stars,Bought this item and have been suffering through meals ever since. Fails to cook rice evenly meaning I’m eating 30% of what I cook. Horrible product in times of shortages.
4.0 out of 5 stars,"So far instant pot has been good for cooking some type of food. However, the thing which is not into my expectations so far is the pressure level for different dishes. Red meat games a lot longer than the prescribed time. Chickpeas also takes about 15-20mins extra over the prescribed time to thoroughly cook. I expected it to be faster"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I finally jumped on the bandwagon and bought this. I thought it wasn't going to be much better than a regular crock pot, but was pleasantly surprised. I watch some youtube videos because it has so many options and was a little confusing. I love it and frequently make meals in it."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"Still figuring it out but what I’ve made so far has been a hit and super easy. I did burn the onions that were supposed to just sauté, it didn’t say I wasn’t supposed to put the lid on and seal it! Live and learn. Including better/more instructions would be helpful."
1.0 out of 5 stars,"There was no warning that the product was only usable in the USA. It was clear that the product was being sent to Australia where the power arrangements are totally different. I cannot use the product. I realise I can return it if I wish, but the process is too cumbersome. I will try and give it to someone who will be moving to Canada. I am disappointed."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"When it arrived on May 12, 2018, I put it on my counter and has never moved it until now and I use it everyday.It cooks everything so fast and well. No more adding water to the beans to keep them from burning!!!!2 YEARS AFTER:It's been almost 2 years now and the IP is still on the countertop and we only use the stove for scrambled eggs and fried fish. When I get the IP fryer lid, the stove will be used for scrambled eggs only. It's truly amazing!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Our pressure cooker is way louder, so we had to go for an instant pot. Cooks the rice well and all other greens. 5 stars for the features for its price."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love my instant pot! It literally can cook anything and I love how you can just sauté or warm things up all in one pot. The sauté function works so quickly, faster than sautéing on the stove top. It washes really nice in the dishwasher too and it’s easy to take apart, put together and move around."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"My 8-quart Instant Pot arrived yesterday mid-day.  This is my 4th or 5th electric pressure cooker, and it is replacing a Cooks Essentials 6-quart electric PC whose interior pot's non-stick lining had chipped.  I also have some smaller Kuhn Rikon stovetop PCs, which permit really quick cooking for the recipes that fit into them.I ""must"" have a large electric pressure cooker for 5 things:1) I love to cook a whole chicken and make my chicken soup completely from scratch.  In the U.S. our grocery stores have big chickens.2) I am hooked on my own Corned Beef and Cabbage, because I cook the corned beef the night before, and remove the fat after a day of refrigeration.  It tastes ""cleaner"" but still has lots of flavor.3) Recipes for beef stews might limit the volume of potatoes, carrots, and onions to fit in the pot.  An 8-quart pot allows me to use a larger cut of beef, and add more potatoes without jeopardizing the PC's ability to come up to pressure.4) PC recipes that take longer than an hour test my patience for hanging around.  I like to ""set it and forget it"" for a while.5) Ribs.  Ribs take up a lot of space, and most people don't limit themselves to a proper ""single"" portion.  Set dry-rubbed ribs on a trivet in the PC and let the water's steam produce moist ribs.  No BBQ sauce is needed!I still use my smaller stovetop PCs for:1) 3-qt is perfect size for rice.  I prefer PC rice to rice cooker rice - less scorching.  I freeze extra cooked rice.2) 2-qt is perfect for simple dinner for 2 - and fast - it takes little time to come up to pressure or for natural release.3) 5-qt braiser holds a full-size round cooling rack, allowing me to steam 4-5 chicken breasts or quickly steam asparagus.4) I use the 5-qt braiser when I need a truly ""quick release"" to add foods in stages.  With a stovetop PC, you take the PC to the sink and run cold water on the lid to reduce the pressure quickly.  You can't do that with an electric cooker.So, how about the 8-quart Instant Pot?1) The inner pot is high quality.  Soaking solves a lot of cleaning problems in stainless steel.2) The silicone gasket fits very snugly.  In fact, after I did my preliminary sudsy wash, it seemed like torture to get the gasket to fit correctly.  I thought I had fit it correctly... until I tried to do the Water Test and I was unable to lock the lid in position.  Thank goodness some kind souls on the Instant Pot Community page on Facebook helped me identify the problem.  (When you get your 8-qt pot, observe carefully how the gasket fits before disassembling for washing.)  Today,when I reassembled my IP, I patiently positioned the ring in one spot and patiently coaxed it into place, so apparently this old dog could still learn a new trick.  (It is important that the gasket and the lid both be completely dry!)3) The 8-qt. machine is BIG, and TALL.  My kitchen counters are the high standard height, and it seemed awkward to me to try to saute in the Instant Pot.  (One person suggested strongly that I use a step ladder - obviously no senior should try sauteing from a ladder.)  With my beef stew recipe, I had planned to saute mushrooms and onions on the stove anyway (both emit a LOT of liquid, plus there is more ""umami"" when prepared this way) and add them to the stew at the end.  So I sauteed the beef in the same 6 3/4 qt Le Creuset pot I was going to use for the mushrooms (I don't flip as much food out of that pot as when I use a normal saute pan).  My method worked fine for me.  If you dread cleaning an extra pot/pan, then you might choose to do everything in the Instant Pot - your choice.  Today I reflected that I might use a table at the lower standard counter height, which would make it easier for me to saute in the Instant Pot itself, as long as the cord reached.  (I loved the oval pot of the Cooks Essential PC - it was so easy to saute in it!)4) The IP came up to pressure and down from pressure faster than the Cooks Essential PC.  For a ""quick"" release, you don't have to wait as long before letting some steam out.  And once the steam lever was released, the pressure came down very fast - that was a huge improvement over the Cook's Essential.5) You can choose different settings for ""Saute"": great when you want a simmer and not a rapid boil!6)  There was plenty of extra room in the pot for the additional potatoes and carrots DH wants in the next batch.7)  Our beef stew was delightful, just as mouth-watering as doing the whole nine yards of Julia Child's Boeuf Bourguignon.I am looking forward to trying many more recipes in this versatile cooker.p.s. The packaging impressed me a lot!  There was a reinforced plastic strap around the Instant Pot shipping box that made it easy to remove from the slightly larger Amazon shipping box.  Inside the Instant Pot shipping box was the product box with all the graphics as you might see on a store shelf.  The product box also had a plastic strap to coax the product box out of the Instant Pot shipping box.  The product box had styrofoam reinforcement of the product at top and bottom.  So the product was well protected during its shipping!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Very easy to use.  Very easy to clean.  Makes great stew, soups, pulled meats (pork, chicken, beef).  Easy to cook mashed potatoes.  Navy Bean soup - recommend soaking beans several hours before cooking.Great to saute meats (does not splatter all over) before cooking.  Really boosts the flavor.  Cooks rice easily but it comes out as gummy (still tastes great)."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love it. The control panel is complicated to figure out at first. But if you read the directions and keep them close by for the first few uses, you should be fine. I got this so that I can free up space in my kitchen. I can now get rid of the stove top pressure cooker, the steamer, the yogurt maker, and the slow cooker. The insert pot is easy to clean even though it isn't Teflon coated, which surprised me. If I need to scrub I just pull out the Bar Keepers Friend and whatever is on there comes right off."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have used this every day since I purchased it.Makes the best, tender meat recipes ever and very fast."
3.0 out of 5 stars,The item looks good on picture which has multiple function. Functions are not easy to operate if you don’t read the manual. They sent a broken condenser collector... Hope they will check their items before they send them...
5.0 out of 5 stars,Love my instant pot so much that I bought one for each of my daughter's. Instant pot cooking is really intriguing when you get into it. I highly recommend this pot!
2.0 out of 5 stars,"Instant Pot IP-DUO Plus60 9-in-1 Multi-Functional Pressure Cooker, 6 QtI was so excited to get this for my aunt. She is a school teacher and cooks larger meals to store later on so I thought this would allow for those home cooked meals without spending hours in the kitchen at the end of the long day. However, when she opened her gift we were highly disappointed. The catch cup that attaches to the back of the Instant Pot was broken. Normally, this wouldn't be an issue but I can't find anyway to contact Amazon about this issue and ask for a replacement...Hopefully someone will read this and respond."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"One of the most useful items of all my kitchen appliances, the Instant Pot gets regular use for both large and small cooking. The stainless steel insert cleans nicely and the controls are easy to use whether manually or programmed.  Boiled eggs are fun to do as the membrane of the egg, peels cleanly with the shells.  Cooking time with meats and vegetables is much shorter and the product is cooked thoroughly."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I LOVE this product. I use it right now primarily to make stock. Made the most awesome seafood gumbo.  Also made chuck roast. Haven't had time to try other recipes. Was afraid of using a pressure cooker, but read directions and so far, so good. I follow directions! Well, when using a pressure cooker. Also made steel cut oats. Great!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"LOVE LOVE LOVE my instant pot!!!! I use it everyday. I'm still learning new recipes and different types of foods to use in it. Best investment I ever got for my kitchen, hands down."
5.0 out of 5 stars,Cooked my first roast in the Instant Pot tonite.  It turned out great!  My wife was totally surprised ;-).  Easy to follow directions.  Read the operation and safety instructions twice !!
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my first pressure cooker and OMG what have I been missing??!!! I love it!! It's so easy to use!! Just be sure you read the manuals first before cooking for the first time, if you've never used one before. I made some beef stew and the meat literally melted in your mouth!!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I did not understand what the hype was about until I finally purchased my own Instant Pot. You can cook practically anything in it, it’s a breeze to clean, it saves time, and your meal will be so delicious. So happy I finally bought one!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my new favorite appliance.  I've had it for a couple of months and use it at least once a week, frequently more.  I can make delicious home made stock in an hour.  Bean soup from dry to soup in 45 minutes (no soaking).  If you're going to buy one appliance this year, make it an Instant Pot.  In my house we call it the Magic Pot."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"After reading all the reviews and comments, I decided to make this purchase and I'm really glad that I did. I have really enjoyed using my Insta Pot. It has made dinner so much easier!Make sure you read the instructions that are included in the product packaging. This makes all the functions so much easier to use and understand."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"My first electric pressure cooker, and I love it. So easy to use and none of the wobbling hissing noises of my grandmother's old stove top one. <3Also kudos to Instant Pot customer service; my pot arrived without the pressure release knob and I emailed them. The response came within minutes, and they immediately posted one to me. I had it 2 days later.I've only made roast and mashed potatoes so far, but the ease of use and ease of clean up are wonderful, and I'm looking foward to working my way through the recipes."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought my IP for a newly purchased motorcoach. On the maiden voyage from Mesa, Az. (Where purchased) to Seattle, I did not use it. However, a tech at the dealership went crazy telling me how wonderful it is and he and his wife use it every night. He recommended a couple Facebook groups to join that give tips and recipes. I read the two different FB pages each chance I got. When we arrived inSeattle I took the pot and brought it to our home to do the break in.. ...that was a break out day! In one day, I did the water test, strawberry compote, NY cheesecake and monkey bread, all turned out perfect and delicious. Since then I have made Crispy Pork carnitas, rice, Manila clams two different ways, a delicious Chocolate lava cake and much more! It is amazing! I have put it into the motorcoach and used several times on a glamping trip with family. They love it! My daughter-in-law ordered on the spot! I have put my recipes on a family blog(nonprofit) sewwhatscookingwithjoan.com"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Very well made, and simple to use, the instructions leave a lot to the imagination, no temp or time info. Do yourself a favor and get a pressure cooking cook book, I have a older stove top cooker, so I know a little about pressure cooking, and I look forward to using this cooker. I got this cooker on a lighting deal with a sale price, I had wanted this cooker for quite a while but the regular price kept holding me back. I would still recommend this cooker."
3.0 out of 5 stars,Happy to receive my instapot which was delivered today but it did not have the glass lid and extra sealing rings as advertised. Feeling let down.
5.0 out of 5 stars,I’ve been going back and forth on whether to buy an instant pot or not. A friend of mine has been urging me to get one so I decided on the prime day deal that I was going to order. I WAS NOT DISAPPOINTED! This thing can do everything it says and more! I love that I can throw chicken in and dinner is on the table in 30 minutes! It’s incredible. I’m very satisfied with this purchase.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"super happy with my instapot, meat, potatoes, beans, rice, vegetables, hard boiled eggs, etc.  extremely happy with this addition to my kitchen"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I can't count how many hours I have saved using my new Instant Pot 8 qt multi use pot.  So glad I choose the 8 qt size, perfect for roasts and stews or anything! Also glad mine came with the stainless steel bowl liner as it is so easy to clean. Food is wonderfully cooked super fast. I recommend you purchase an Instant Pot recipe book to accompany. It has very helpful information."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I was not sure I wanted an Instant Pot. Now, I don’t know how I lived without it. I make many more things than I used to and a lot of wholesome meals just sort of happened. There doesn’t seem to be that much effort required. The Instant Pot really is amazing!!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,If you are contemplating buying one of these...dont.Seriously the best investment! Ive used it twice this week alone(its only wednesday) and it tastes amazing! My husband and I are currently displaced from our home due to a house fire and this has been the best purchase because its an all in one tool that we use in the apartment we are in and we dont have to worry about it being plugged in all day....(we are SUPER paranoid about leaving electronics plugged in.)I've cooked beans and soup in it. Cooked in under an hour and tasted AMAZING. There are so many recipes that I cannot wait to try....Im so excited!
2.0 out of 5 stars,"I love my Instant Pot for making chicken stock, all types of soups, and rice. However, lots of dishes fail terribly due to this model's propensity to scorch things, register ""BURN"" on the display, and stop the cooking process. I have read and watched troubleshooting guides. I have done all the workarounds. They simply don't work. Maybe it's just this model, but any time I try to make the famous Instant Pot butter chicken or any other curry-type, stewed-meat-type recipe with meat and a bit of liquid (esp tomato paste or canned tomatoes), this thing reads ""BURN,"" the food scorches, and I have to go through several rounds scraping down the bottom of the pot, deglazing, and praying to a god I don't believe in, just to maybe salvage dinner. (It'll read ""BURN"" three times and then magically work on the fourth try.)Note: The dishes I'm talking about are some of the most popular Instant Pot dishes. These are things the IP is supposed to excel at. Not so, at least for this model. And I'm not some novice cook who doesn't know his way around the kitchen. This product simply does not work as it's supposed to.It's been very frustrating, to the point where I don't think I'd recommend this product to others, unless they only wanted to make stocks and rice.P.S. If you do buy the IP, don't throw out your Crock Pot; the IP is lousy as a slow-cooker."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've used it probably 15 times already and every time it's been amazing. Don't hesitate and JUST BUY IT!! You don't have to plan dinner hours in advance. Need shredable chicken for a pot pie? Instant pot it! Gotta make wings for a last-minute gathering of friends? It's got you covered. Seriously, just click buy it now. You'll be so glad you did."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I am a novice pressure cooker cook, so I was pleasantly surprised at how easy it was to use.  The instructions were clear and easy to read.  Not sure I will make many of the recipes that came with the cooker, but I already ordered a pressure cooker cookbook to expand my repertoire (Great Food Fast found on Amazon).  It browned a large chicken using the Saute function beautifully, but it does lose a lot of color during cooking, so will go a bit darker next time.  I have wanted a pressure cooker for years and thought about a non-electric model. I also considered a model with a non-stick coating, but didn't like the idea of yet another cooking vessel with a coating on it.  There is no need for the non-stick coating if you brown long enough.  Comes with a stainless steel pot, which is worth a little extra investment.  I definitely made the right choice with the Instant Pot IP-Duo60!"
1.0 out of 5 stars,Mine came with scuffs. Now I have to go through the stress of replacement
1.0 out of 5 stars,"When I bought this product, I really live it because it cooked very fast and has various cooking options. However in a little over 1 year, this thing just stopped working completely  midway during a cooking session. I am soo mad. This should not stop working so quickly especially since I have even used it that often for it to be ""tired"". Love it but very disappointed.  Wish it was a long term investment."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I use this for basically every meal I cook, at least 3-4 times per week. It is 100% good value for what you are getting. There are so many great meals you can cook with this."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love this cooker. I have learned to use this to thaw, cook mostly done, pork baby back ribs and chicken breasts so I can finish the baking in the oven for barbequed ribs or chicken. Great when time is not available for normal baking or weather, etc. keeps you inside."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"After the this happens, we started to look up on forum and some owner reported to have this issue after the first use. The issue isn't common according to the replied as other owner has no issue even after a year usage.Edit after about a year the machine still work great! I'm changing it to 4/5!!!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,I love love love this!! My kids can cook chicken nuggets in it in 5 minutes. I wish it was bigger but I’d rather have this than a huge fryer
5.0 out of 5 stars,"So far we are very pleased with the purchase. It cuts down a lot of cooking time especially after working all day. Be careful when using it because the top gets very hot. Also when releasing the pressure the steam will burn you so you have to pay attention when opening it up. Make sure you have a big place to keep it. It does take up a lot of room. Cleanup is super easy, it’s essentially just a big bowl."
3.0 out of 5 stars,"Convenient but right after a year (after limited warranty period), the valve on my IP became very loose and the IP will no longer get up to pressure. I have only used my IP about 10 times over the course of a year before that happen. So I'm very disappointed at the quality even though I recommended it endlessly to family and friends when it was working."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I use this thing all the time. I wasn't sure it was the greatest purchase but its my kitchen BFF next to my coffeemaker. Great for dried beans, rice, soups, ect. I make soy yogurt which is far simpler than dairy based. Dump it in, hit a button, and walk away for twelve hours. These cookers really shine if you do a prep day once or twice a week; get a lot of stuff done fast."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"We purchased this product because we have a friend that's all about the Instant Pot and goes on and on about it.  I'll say this, we have two standard stovetop pressure cookerS that my wife loves, but since purchasing this a couple of months ago we haven't used our standard pressure cookers at all.  This machine really is a one stop shop. There's a slight learning curve to use it, but once you figure it out, it's incredibly versatile.  Going to make yogurt this week!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"The Instant Pot has changed the way we cook!  This unit saves us lots of space as we have been able to get rid of our pressure cooker, egg steamer, slow cookers (2), and rice cookers (2).  We have made everything from yogurt and hard boiled eggs to delicious baby back ribs and orange chicken.  I love the Instant Pot so much that we just bought another one (3 qt size) that we will use for traveliing and cooking more than one thing at a time."
5.0 out of 5 stars,Love the instant pot! Nice that the pot and lid are both dishwasher safe! And I make so so so many dinners and desserts in the instant pot. It's basically fail-proof!
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love how I can cook from frozen to ready in 20 - 30 minutes. Recommend extra seals, they grab smells from food, lids are nice, and an extra pan is on my list for sure.  Look up you tube for anything from cleaning to dinner to desserts.  Sadly not a fan of the app. they advertise but there are several other sources on how to use it."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is the best! I know a lot of people complain about it breaking, but I have used this once a week or more for over four months now, and it works like a charm. Just follow the instructions on the product and follow the recipe you use! No second thoughts, this is the best ever. Meal prep made easy and fast with minimal cleanup."
5.0 out of 5 stars,It can cook soup and porridge or steam something. I don't think it is good to cook rice as it is hard to measure how much water should be added.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love this electric pressure cooker, it has my tainless steel pot, 8 qt. Comes with what you need to use, as soon as you clean it, I use this just about ever day, I also use it to make my different teas with sliced fresh ginger & mint,it's my go to cooker, very easy to clean. This is at the next leave. Thank You!!"
1.0 out of 5 stars,Does not hold pressure. Tried all the fixes online outside of buying a new seal. Only used handful of times should not require a new one already. Will not be recommending any more of these to friends or family after the latest inconvenience this has caused me.
5.0 out of 5 stars,I've had the instapot for about 6 months now and I totally love it. I've used it a bunch of times and had had absolutely no issues. I'm so in love with being able to have amazing meals cooked in under an hour. This product is amazing.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I had no idea how to use an instant pot but u got it in cyber Monday. I use it usually 9-12 days a month. I love it! It’s great for a busy mom. I toss something in, get the kids homework going and before you know it we have dinner made. My favorite meal is either 5 cheese ziti or potatoes soup"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I got this on prime day and truly wasn’t sure I needed it. But the price was really good so I did it, and turns out I love it! I’ve already used it for extremely fool proof cooking of chicken which came out super tender and delicious as well as steel cut oats which I usually don’t have the patience for. It’s easy to clean and absolutely no complaints so far. If you’re on the fence and can get this for a decent deal, I  would recommend it- you’ll find use for it!"
1.0 out of 5 stars,This item stopped turning on months ago. I used it for Quinoa and a few potatoes maybe 5-6 times. Now when I plug it in nothing happens. It basically broke after 3-4 months. And of course it broke after I can no longer return it.
5.0 out of 5 stars,I have really enjoyed having this air fryer lid to go with my instant pot.  I use it quite often and found a permanent spot on my countertop to have it out and handy to use.
2.0 out of 5 stars,"Ordered three of these, two of them did not have the measuring cups, spatulas, or metal rack included.  Very disappointed.  I have reached out to Instant Brand customer service, but no response."
1.0 out of 5 stars,I ordered it from Sweden. We have 220V and european standard plugg. I didn’t se any way to order that and I didn’t se anything in the discription om the item. So I got an air fryer made for 110V and standard USA-plug. I thought amazon recognized from wherer I ordered the product.
2.0 out of 5 stars,"i didn't get to use it. i had no idea all of the plastic et al was stored inside the pot. i took it out of box. plugged it and and was fiddling with the buttons. little did i know that the stuff was melting. apparently on page 12 of the manuel it reminds u too take every thing out first!!! not happy. after finally breaking down and getting one after a few years, i don't even get to use it!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,Got this for my wife and some cookbooks and she uses he instant pot a lot. She made a lot of good food and I can say not one came out bad. Bought another one just in case this one broke
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Now I rarely cook with anything else.  Love the fast/hot SAUTE feature prior to slow cooking, pressure cooking, or soup simmering.  Settings are excellently calibrated.  My 8-qt. stockpot makes delicious beef/vegetable/bean soup in 6.5 hours.  Great to come home to!  I'm soon to try hardboiled eggs and steamed veggies.  Can't wait. Fantastic product. Prices vary so shop."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I use it at least once a week, as I’m still figuring it out and finding recipes. Most of the time I honestly sorry to use it haha but I love it for what I have used so far. Having the sauté option so I never need a pan, being able to to put in uncooked noodles still blows my mind. I love this thing!!!"
2.0 out of 5 stars,"I love this pot. But today I received a distorted pot from Amazon US. I guess the pot is distorted from the beginning, not by the transport because the containing box is very thick, there is no sign of being affected. I was so disapointed because I'm now living in Japan. It's very complicated and difficult for me if I want to change this pot. So I don't do the procedure to change it. I hope the pot has no errors inside and its functions. Although it may still work well. But this is really a bad experience for me when this is the first time I bought a thing on the Amazon US. I think if you are in other country (not USA), think twice before buying this pot!!!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"It is everything advertised except that it takes 10-15 minutes for the ""cool down"" when used in the pressure cooker mode like any device of this type does I suppose. My only real dislike is its large size. We also feel that we need to keep our old crockpot which I hoped we could give away because we know we can leave it unattended (we don't feel that we can walk away from the Instant Pot)"
4.0 out of 5 stars,"So far I am very happy with my Instant Pot.  Watching youtube has helped me get acquainted with it.  I'm looking forward to making more tasty meals.  I've made yogurt, chicken and steamed rice and all have come out to my satisfaction."
2.0 out of 5 stars,the  problem is that the instructions on putting this together .... are both hard to understand and often just plain don't make sense.  I am on the lookout for someone with an engineering degree who can help me put this together
1.0 out of 5 stars,"Product showed up.. I plugged it in. It gave me a c6l error which means faulty pressure sensor. I called instant pot and they told me the product was defective and I should return to amazon. There is nothing more they could do.. complete waste of my time. I will be buying another brand of pressure cooker, maybe I'll be able to use it at least once."
5.0 out of 5 stars,The Instant Pot is awesome. Very easy to cook meals and even easier to clean up. First dish I made was  meatloaf with potatoes and carrots in one go in around 40 minutes. Came out amazing. The coolest thing about the Instant pot is that you can make anything you can pretty much think of and with pressure cookers becoming more popular there are so many easy recopies out there to try. I’m definitely satisfied with it and would recommend it to anyone.
5.0 out of 5 stars,It's a great cooker for those smaller meals or pieces of larger meals. We use it as a rice and spagettii cooker as well as a vegetable steamer.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"It takes a little patience learning the manual, but the results are wonderful.  It 'cooks' only after it heats until steam develops, so that has to be taken into account for 'cooking time'.  What's impressive is, foods that always taste 'better the next day', after they 'season', such as pinto beans, tastes good right away after they've cooled!A little bit of a learning curve, but produces outstanding results.I have the 8 quart, which I believe is worthwhile for roasts, etc."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I haven’t had any problems with thevsafwty features, it’s super easy to use, and versatile! I love that it has a sauté setting so I don’t have to dirty an extra pan. I also love that it can slow cook or pressure cook, and anything in between. It’s my new go-to kitchen gadget. I should have bought one years ago! It has certainly simplified dinner time."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Nothing short of amazing. These are everything everyone says they are. I would avoid pasta of any kind though. I know there are a lot of recipes for that out there, but it just isn't the best way to cook pasta. I made amazing chili recipes, thai curry, stew, and the best steel cut oats. And there are so many other things to explore with this. Well worth every penny."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love the multi- functionality of the product. My favorite food to cook is, believe it or not, hard boiled eggs. I need a lot of protein in my diet & eating as many eggs as I want helps keep my weight down. I can have 10 eggs ready to peel & eat in 15 minutes by using the pressure cook method. Love this product."
1.0 out of 5 stars,"Could not get it to seal! Leaked water all over! No Matter what, I tried everything. Contacted ip an sent pictures an they told me it was defective! I loved the concept of it an when I was going to order the replacement one it had jumped $10, sorry ip your not worth that! Went with the mealthy pot for $30 cheaper, with all the same features, an 4.9 stars!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Superbe, I love it. So easy to handle, cook and clean. Good quality material.I order for Instant Pot Duo Plus 9-in-1 -- 6 Quant, which was quite bigger than I assumed.So I brought Stackable Insert Pans too, and now I am able to cook three dishes together."
5.0 out of 5 stars,Why did I wait so long to buy this? Did I think I wasn’t cool enough to cook chicken wings in like 20 minutes? Did I think I didn’t deserve it? Stop skipping over instant pot recipes and just buy it. You won’t regret it
1.0 out of 5 stars,This should have been very clear during shoppoing online however i did not see the disclaimer until item arrived where i found it written on the box 📦
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This thing has literally changed my life. I’m a health care worker which requires that I work long/odd hours. Because of this I usually don’t have time to cook for myself and my husband before it gets too late to eat. Now, thanks to the Instant Pot, I can toss something in it, forget about it, do what I need to get ready for the next day, all while dinner is cooking away. Things that used to take all day to cook are now done in an hour and taste just as good as if I they had taken all day. It’s also great for sanitizing baby bottles!"
1.0 out of 5 stars,"The red plunger valve failed after 3 times, meaning that during pressure cooking moisture is released and food burns.The unit is worthless, and I read the reviews that were similar."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love love love. I have used this to make soup, chili, spaghetti, roast, chicken, ribs and cheesecake. It has done amazing. Very easy instructions and easy to use. I have found several recipes online as well. Easy to clean as well. I have used the different functions and I love how you can do so many things in one pot."
5.0 out of 5 stars,I love this Instant Pot. I made delicious meals quickly for 8 months until it suddenly stopped working. I googled problems and found 2. 1- the inner seal was worn out and needed to be replaced or 2- The pressure valve on the lid was broken. I chose to buy 2 new seals so I would never be without the Instant Pot again. I tried to use it as soon as they came in. It still could not build pressure. I was not able to lift the valve on the lid as some people claim they do. I am very disappointed. This is much too expensive to last only 8 months. I expected to get years of use from it. I have submitted a claim ticket online as the warranty states and am waiting for an answer. My biggest fear is the next lid does not last any longer and I find out I wasted my money on this product.
3.0 out of 5 stars,"This works perfectly well for everything except slow cooking. For most dishes the slow cooking is fine, but for other the slow cook temp is a bit too low and makes it unsuitable for slow cooking certain dishes."
5.0 out of 5 stars,Best gift I ever gave. Inexpensive as these pots go. She has used it quite a bit and meals turned out great. Sent me photos of entire meals prepared at same time. Amazing. Household staple now. Want one for me now. Heavy duty and doesn’t take up a lot of counter space.
5.0 out of 5 stars,So.... fast shipperGOOD  condition
4.0 out of 5 stars,The only problem I had with this was the lack of detailed instructions that came with it.  You have to search out videos and helpful hints online.
2.0 out of 5 stars,Ok so I never owned a pressure cooker before this is my 1st and most likely last one. Food burns in it so easily and it takes for ever to stop the timing s are so weird . It never cooks in a minute or two it’s like I am cooking it on stove. As I said it’s first time I am using it but I won’t recommend anyone to buy it. Rice cooker is all I need😄😁
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I didn’t expect it to really be do all it was supposed to do and I haven’t used it as much as I would like but it is amazing! It is a great pressure cooker, an awesome slow cooker and rice in 10 minutes? I am truly in love!  I really appreciate the metal insert and ease of washing. I will buy one for my daughter as soon as I can afford it!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"The instant pot is an absolute beast! It makes some of the best mashed potatoes I’ve ever had, rice is out of this world, and soups come out just mind blowing. Definitely take the safety precautions seriously though. If you are careless with it, it will hurt you."
1.0 out of 5 stars,"I received my Instant Pot without the condensation collector.  Although I love the Instant pot and have the 6 quart version, I am unhappy about not receiving all of the parts and not being able to use the one I received."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"The use of this pot is limitless.  All sorts of recipes for all kind of food including other countries.  We have dozen food using it already.  Wish the power cord is a little bit longer.  The 8 quart is perfect for fitting a chicken, don't know if the 6 quart can fit one or not."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have only had this item for about 2 weeks but have used it several times already.  Two batches of yogurt, beef roast with carrots & potatoes, pork ribs & a few other things have been made in my new Instapot.  I have recently order an Instapot cookbook so that I may expand my culinary horizons with this cooker.  Everything I have made so far has come out wonderful.  This little wonder is very easy to use (much easier than my pressure canner, which has been used as a pressure cooker in the past).  Love it & very glad I made the investment in this gadget!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"It's easy to use, easy to clean and yes the product is safe. Follow the instructions and you're good to go. Piece of advice to all new users, if you plan on making pasta or rice in this machine, allow it to self release the pressure. This means letting it rest 10 minutes after cooking instead of immediately releasing the pressure nozzle. You'll avoid the foamy mess that comes with cooking starches."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love making homemade yogurt in this-we make a gallon at a time for a fraction of what it costs to buy from the store. This means we’re not buying it out of plastic tubs; less waste. We can make a gallon of organic, homemade yogurt for about $6 but if we had purchased a gallon worth of yogurt in tubs we’d be spending close to $30.Curries and soups taste like they’ve been cooking all day when really the whole process start to finish takes under an hour."
5.0 out of 5 stars,I absolutely love this!  The only thing I didn't like is the instructions manual.  It isn't very good and I've found myself online looking up instructions on how to use each setting!  The recipe booklet also left a bit to be desired......some of those recipes were probably NOT ideal ones nor appealing ones for first time users.  If your looking to make your meal quickly then I'm telling you this is it hands down!  My first meal of meatloaf and mashed potatoes was done in 20 minutes...Amazing!
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought this before a major surgery, so it didn't get a lot of use for a while. Mainly I was boiling eggs, because it is easier than the stove. Now that I'm using it more it is great. The best thing is that I don't have to babysit it while it cooks like stovetop pressure cookers need to be. It's also very easy to clean.The photo is of potatoes and mussels cooked in it. It cooks nearly everything."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"So I had been thinking about getting one of these gadgets for a few years.  I didn't know anyone who had ever used one, and never really heard much about pressure cooking.  It just seemed like something that made sense.  I used to use a crock pot on occasion, but, I would literally have to make and eat 3 meals before that meal was done.  I need instant gratification!!This thing produces.  In big ways.  Some of the best meals I have ever had.  So far, I have made:Beef stew, pulled pork, pulled pork (then carnitas), chile chicken verde, chili, corn soup, and garbanzo bean (hummus).I am so happy I got this thing.  It makes great comfort food.  Great healthy food.  It is so easy to use, a monkey could do it.I am going back to the kitchen for another bowl of tender, delicious, beef stew (that took 30 minutes to make.)Bye bye crock pot."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love this!! I was terrible about remembering to set the crock-pot or thaw something for dinner.  I can cook chicken from frozen in 16 minutes!  There are a ton of recipes on pinterest and in the included recipe book. I was a little terrified of the quick release valve, but it has proven easy to use and safe. The only downside is that the bowl inside is a little cumbersome to clean as food can cling to the sides somewhat easily. But overall - we love it! Highly recommend."
5.0 out of 5 stars,As a mom of 3 young kids who dislikes cooking this is a must! I’m actually cooking a lot more since buying the istapot. I make lots of soups loaded with vegetables which is a win for a balanced meal. I’ve made pinto beans in 1 hr and even made lamb “birria” which turned out amazing.  A whole chicken? Oh yes! I’m excited to keep discovering new recipes in this bad boy.  And the clean up? A breeze. I’m enjoying cooking for once and that alone is worth itAnd don’t worry about the leaning curve. Best advice is look up instapot recipes on Pinterest. By the 3rd meal you’ll get a big feel for how this pot works
1.0 out of 5 stars,Defective out of the box. Just opened it to try out but the display works weirdly. Sometimes it’s blank display and it doesn’t even turn on. Returning it.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Never thought I would need two instant pots, but decided after getting the 6 qt I needed the 3 qt.  I was right, I use both all the time.  Its a true gem and life saver."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"We love our instant pot..  love all the free recipes online .. we even made hard boiled eggs in it after hearing how easy they peel.... and they do peel easy! LOL!  We've made chili & navy bean soup.. using dry beans, and frozen meat.. it's amazing how easy it works."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased the Instant Pot to make it easier with preparing meals and so glad that I did.  I'm not one to cook and usually use my crockpot and or rice cooker for meals but now i'm using the Instant Pot more.  It was a little intimidating at first but after a few tries, i'm more comfortable and starting to use it more.  I found a pot roast recipe online and it cooked in about 80 minutes using the pressure cooker module and it was a success!!The Instant Pot comes in many sizes, so I think anyone would benefit from the Instant Pot."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I would give this 6 starts if I could. I have been using my Instant Pot now for a few months. To date I have made stew, soup, ribs, rice, beans, and I have used the Instant Pot to saute, pressure cook, and slow cook. Each of these application has turned out great. There is a bit of a learning curve in determining the amount of water to use with certain applications (e.g. Rice), but all-in-all this product has replaced several items. I would purchase this again and have recommended it to several people."
5.0 out of 5 stars,This little 6 quart Instant Pot is just the right size for this family of 2 and for transport to cook on a road trip. It is so easy to use and clean.  It is so versatile.  A must-have appliance.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is primarily a pressure cooker, which we love because it allows us to cook things after work that would otherwise be out of the question due to the length of time normally required.  Things that would normally take an hour or more cook in around 15 minutes.  Very handy for that feature alone."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Just received my 7Qinstant pot which everyone is raving about and I LOVE IT!!! My only regret is I wished  I’d bought it earlier.I cooked an oversized large sweet potatoe in 30 minutes and wow....it cooked all the way through in such a short time, which would have otherwise taken another hour more on the stovetop  So easy to use and no mess at all.The stainless steel pot makes it easy to wash.What’s most important is the safety of using this pot. I used to have a regular pressure cooker and when it releases steam, it leaves a sticky residue on my counter top and the worst is it ‘blew up’ and the food splattered all over my kitchen and ceiling too. That’s history now.YouTube has several instant pot easy to cook yummy recipes. I’m enjoying cooking more now than ever before.So, if you’re still thinking of buying an instant pot.......don’t wait for as long as I did!!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,This is a good thing if it wasn't so filled with safety. I guess that's because people have become litigation crazy and hoping to get hurt then rich. Sad.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love Instant Pot. It's life changing. Make a one pot meal, then have enough to freeze for 5 more dinners. And pretty much everything I've cooked with it comes out amazing!  No shortage of recipes on the internet."
5.0 out of 5 stars,I love this pot. So easy to make a meal especially if you're having a lot of people over. Not a lot of fuss and everything I've made has been a big hit. I've had friends buy it after seeing mine and how it works
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This pressure cooker does it all. It has so many functions like sauté, steam, rice, meat/stew even yogurt. I was sold when I could make hard boiled eggs in just a mere 6 minutes! I'm a busy mom with busy busy nights so this pressure cooker will and has been my life saver. I'm notorious for forgetting to take out meat to thaw. No worries now because this pressure cooker will cook frozen to fast in no time. I'd recommend this pressure to anyone! Homemade yogurt is so much better than bought at the store."
5.0 out of 5 stars,Yes this thing is versatile - there are recipes EVERYWHERE to make all kinds of things in the Instant Pot. I hate to cook but this makes it easy and painless. I love the saute feature because it minimizes extra dishes to wash; you can truly have a 1 pot meal. The best thing is that I can make a meal using rock hard frozen meat in 30 minutes!
5.0 out of 5 stars,I am new to the instant pot. I did watch a few YouTube videos and got the hang of it pretty quick. Love the pot. It did just what it said it would do. I did a 3 pound sirloin tip roast in 1 hour and 50 minutes. It come out fantastic. Also tried a triple citrus cheesecake and that also come out perfect. It is a wonderful addition to my kitchen.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This thing is tip top! Set it and forget it and so easy to clean! I have the 8 quart version and it can cook 5-6 pound turkeys in it, just need to bake it for afew minute to crisp skin afterwards in the oven. Makes great deer/beef/chicken stew. I love how it is all stainless steel! No worries of aluminum leeching into your food. Can also cook perfect corned beef every time! I am so glad i caught this on sale for $80!!!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I gave away my pressure cooker, crockpot and rice cooker and have now replaced them with the Instant Pot!  I use it all the time and my husband who is a picky eater is always amazed at how good everything I make in it tastes.  Highly recommend!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love the instant pot. I have already made two delicious meals. It does occasionally give a burn warning when there is no problem, but other than that, I love it."
5.0 out of 5 stars,I live in an rv at the moment and this is the perfect product. It is a space saver and I can easily cook or bake anything. It's a must have for rv living.
1.0 out of 5 stars,"Wanted to like this product as it was highly recommended. My pot received C6L error on second steam cook. All lights and noises went off. Unplugged and let it ""rest"" and realized I shouldn't be troubleshooting within days of new product. Returning the poorly made product. Will stick with my reliable crock pot. Yes, takes more time but will not error out. Deal with enough troubleshooting at work."
5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazing!!!!!!! You have to get one of this if you want to reduce the cooking time of your meals. One of the BEST purchases I have made. Recommend! Now my sister and mom own one because of how great this product is.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I use my instant pot 8qt just about every other day. It’s just me and my husband, but even still, we’ve ended up saving quite a bit of money because we eat out so much less now because it’s so easy to use. It saves lots of precious time and makes your food taste so much better under pressure!"
1.0 out of 5 stars,I returned the item for a refund. The only refund I received was for the protection plan! Not for the expensive pot! Please investigate your error & refund my money! Thank you!
5.0 out of 5 stars,"My wife was a little intimidated at first, but as soon as she got online and started looking up recipes she has been using this almost every day. Anyone who comes over to the house gets the full commercial as she tells them how easy and convenient it is to cook a meal in this thing.  Super easy to use and the clean up is quick with the removable inner pot."
5.0 out of 5 stars,Purchased for my mother for Christmas and she uses it all the time now. Really does cook well and saves a lot of time over traditional crock pots. I purchased the largest capacity model and do not regret it- you can cook just about anything short of a holiday Turkey in it. The flexibility is probably what I like the most. I plan on picking one up myself in the future.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I own two Instant Pot's. A 3 quart and a 6 quart. I love them. I am disabled and have real issues using the stove and oven. Tired of burning myself I bought an Instant Pot.  I can cook now, and feel safe. One pot cooking is great. I've made soups, roasts, steaks, stir fry, oatmeal... I've made everything I know how to cook, and then some."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"I really like this, but I wish it was a little more user friendly and the ""pressure cooking"" was all that is was cracked up to be. I have found when cooking roasts (approx. 3#) that if I sear (in the pot), use the slow cooker setting for 2 hrs and then pressure cook for 45 minutes we're much happier with the outcome. With that being said, the pressure mode is where it's at when it comes to soups."
5.0 out of 5 stars,I love this. And it's great for reheating things like fried shrimp or other coated food that tastes better crisp. Great product. Love it. Works wonderfully. 5 stars!!
5.0 out of 5 stars,I got it for my mom for Christmas. She messages me almost daily about what she cooked in her Instant Pot. It has saved her so much time and work in the kitchen. She is very grateful to have it! Now I need one...
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Omg!Made first meal, salmon with red potatoes, yam, green beens, garlic and shallots. Took all of ten minutes. Super easy clean up! Tasted delish! Immediately called my Dad and tried to sell him on one. He's old school....but I can tell I planted a seed. Well done, IP."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I LOVE my instant pot!! It has transformed the way I cook! Absolutely wonderful addition, I don’t dread the “what’s for dinne?”  anymore, you can make something for a whole week or have dinner from frozen and have a fabulous meal in less than an hour  without having to babysit the food on top of the stove, makes cooking actually fun and soo easy I am actually eating healthier now!  Not nearly as intimidating as I thought it was don’t let yourself be intimidated it’s easy!  There’s so much you can cook in it that I never imagined, and the yogurt is fabulous!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love this item! Was very skeptical, but it works great! Made my wings crispy!!!!!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,We’ve only used this a few times but so far we really like it. If you’re a newbie like me it definitely takes some time to get used to using it. Everything we’ve made has turned out great.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"One of the best purchases I have ever made. It’s amazing, and I don’t even do a fraction of the stuff you can actually do with it. Everyone needs an instant pot!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"It is not like my grandmas old pressure cooker ! Groaning and wheezing...Its quite, efficient, I love the programming options. Its easy to clean.the first time I cooked beans in it they were amazing !!! So soaking and one in no time....Highly recommended for goulash, braising, etc."
1.0 out of 5 stars,"I loved my instant pot, I used it almost daily. For the money, one would expect many years of use out of a kitchen appliance. I have never had an appliance die certainly not in less than two years. Very disappointed, no trouble shooting, Instant pot does not refurbish old items either which many appliance companies do, it is very wasteful not to. I was told ""Oh sorry mine still works I don't know why yours died. It's after a year so you will have to buy a new one."" Time to find better companies to support."
1.0 out of 5 stars,So much for buying and then finding a better deal when you get charged 15 dollars to send it back
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This was such a great buy! So convenient! The only downfall is it keeps the smell of whatever you were cooking. Ive washed the sealant ring, ive even steamed some vinegar in the pot and it still has a smell of broth. (Thats mainly what i use this for). I would like to make some yogurt in it, but im afraid it will taste like broth 😆. Other than that - this instant pot is amazing!!!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm hooked! We bought this on Cyber Monday and absolutely love it! So convenient for a busy mom cooking for a family of 4. I can't wait to continue seeing what it can do,  I'm just amazed so far."
5.0 out of 5 stars,What a Breeze it is to Cook without all the hassle!! This Instant Pot is a Blessing to all who cook!!! Cooks in Half the time / easy recipes to Follow / even for those who can’t cook! FANTASTIC for ALL/ & uses less power too👍
5.0 out of 5 stars,"A friend recommended this and at first I was concerned about adapting my recipes.  Then I noticed you could just put your meat in and hit the stew button then add more or less time.  After about 25 minutes, you just open it up, add the rest, then press stew again and reduce the time to 5 minutes.  Because it finishes the cooking cycle then goes into automatic ""keep warm"", you can go do chores or forget about it and the meal is ready when you are."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love, love love it! Have liked everything single thing I have made so far, and so easy to use! I was looking for a new crockpot, but when I heard about this had to get one, and not one bit sorry. I got the 8 quart, because I used to make things in my 6 quart crockpot and it would boil over. Now I don't have to worry about that. I am a busy working woman, so the time saving is amazing with the electric pressure cooker, and no fears of exploding like with my regular one. Highly recommend this."
5.0 out of 5 stars,I love this! I feel the smaller pots would be best for a family of two. 8 qt would be best for a family of four or more.
5.0 out of 5 stars,Just received my instant pot today!! I am so happy with it. I've already used it twice! Supper was a pot roast. Cooked it for 55 min. And it was fall apart tender! Highly recommend this instant pot. Tomorrow Will be making yogurt.

5.0 out of 5 stars,My daughter wanted this and she loves cooking with her instant pot.She's trying to eat healthier and this has given her lots of new tasty recipes to try
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I never thought I needed one of these since I often use a pressure cooker and a crock pot, Then I found myself in a hotel type setting with no stove for an extended period of time.  This thing was a life saver and after I successfully made so many wonderful things, I decided that once I returned home I could get rid of my rice cooker, steamer and even maybe my crockpot!!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I was horrified to actually use this thing, but it is actually super easy and makes awesome food. I haven't gotten into the yogurt/apple sauce stuff yet, but meat and Mac n cheese are my favorite! I don't know how I lived without this thing!"
1.0 out of 5 stars,"I followed the instructions verbatim and watched YouTube Videos!  Very cumbersome to make the machine begin the pressure cooking mode (yes, I did seal it properly and inspected the seal each time for proper seating).  The timer on the cooker did not match the timer on the Pot Duo I phone App.  Finally gave up and ordered a Fissler Stovetop pressure cooker made in Germany, not from Duo’ China Megaplants.  Don’t waste your money even if the Duo is on sale."
2.0 out of 5 stars,"I've had it for almost two years (in January) and it died last night.  It was great while it lasted, but I would definitely buy a warranty next time - not impressed with the durability....loved the ease of meal prep."
5.0 out of 5 stars,I am getting use to using my insta pot. I am glad I bought the stainless steel insert.  I have had no problems with food sticking to it. Even if I did I prefer it to the non stick ones that are scratched up inside. I must admit I bought the big pot to make food to share with others. It is big. It does not fit in my apt. size cupboards so I store it in the box it came in and in another room.I have no regrets purchasing this great appliance.
5.0 out of 5 stars,I finally caved and bought one on Prime Day. I have not stopped using it since! I was intimidated before I purchased but its very easy once I followed a few recipes to get the hang of all the options. Frozen bone-in meat gets so tender after about 25 minutes!
3.0 out of 5 stars,"The pot works OK, but it smells plastic or chemical. After a while, I detected that the odor actually comes from the silicone seal ring. I wonder if the ring is defective, or used non-qualified materials. I am hesitating to use it for afraid of unsafe chemical contamination"
4.0 out of 5 stars,"I've gone through a number of these, as some of them are faulty. However, once you get one that works, it's likely to become your new best friend in the kitchen. I use mine almost daily and no longer use the stove for cooking."
5.0 out of 5 stars,This is one of my favorite kitchen items.  I use it all the time. I can make a big batch of chili in about 45 minutes. I make perfect rice in it. Meats fall off the bone. It makes great oatmeal. Today I wanted to make a batch of spaghetti in the crock pot. The instant pot doesn't cook it down as much as I would like. I didn't get it in the crock pot in enough time to cook all day so I started it in the instant pot for 30 minutes and natural released then transferred it to my slow cooker. It was the best ever! My next adventure will be yogurt! and canning jams!
5.0 out of 5 stars,My first pressure cooker. Super impressed with its versatility. I feel like I’m missing something on how to open the steam valve though. Scares the crap out of me every time even though I know what’s coming. Lol.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is the best invention since sliced bread!It does everything but take the kids to school!Food fit for a king, made by peasants, cooked in  alien technology."
2.0 out of 5 stars,"I had heard that others ""loved"" their insta pot.  I used it for the first time for chicken breasts, followed instructions specifically and ended up with rubber hard chicken.  This morning I tried it for applesauce, followed a recipe, 8 mins. cook time, when it showed that it was done, the apples were still totally hard.  It's too late to return it, I think it will end up just sitting in the cupboard and I will stick with my crock pot!"
4.0 out of 5 stars,"My only regret is that I didn't purchase the 8 QT. That said, I can cook an outstanding meal for 6 people in a flash! Made a roast with veggies, fork-tender and delish, in about 1 hour. Looking forward to trying many other recipes."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"What is not to love.  I jumped on the pressure cooker bandwagon quite some time ago and use it daily.  I could be a salesperson for it :-)  This is as important as a toaster in your kitchen IMO.  Not a day goes by that I don't cook with this.  From soaked oats overnight to bone broth to pasta.  So easy to use.  Don't be intimated by it, so many options and recipes online to get you started.  I have 2 so that I can cook mulutiple dishes at once.  Amazon offers great hot deals on this product!"
2.0 out of 5 stars,"The pressure cooker on the Instant pot is ok, however the slow cook option doesn’t work at all. Turns on, but does heat up enough to cook; acts like it’s in “keep warm” mode.It’s very large and difficult to store, and has too many moving parts that can easily become misplaced. I would opt for a different version of an instant pot if ordering again."
1.0 out of 5 stars,"Didn’t seal properly, and regularly ruined my food. When I reached out to customer support, they sent me a fifteen-bullet point checklist of instructions to follow in order, including making 20-minute recipes of water, and shooting video of problems. I thought this was supposed to be an easy machine to use? Do not recommend."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I will NEVER ever cook a pot roast, short ribs or corned beef brisket in ANYTHING else. I have not done chicken in it yet, but I'm sure that I will try that as well. This is so much better than a Crock Pot. I'm a pretty good cook and this has elevated some of my best dishes to 5 star restaurant quality. It's perfect."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"Still learning how use. The recipes are a little deciptive when it says 10 mins, it can take up to 5-10 mins for the pot to get up to pressure so it’s like 15-20 mins plus the release of pressure another (2-20 mins) before the food is done. The recipes I have tried have been excellent, but slightly over or undercooked. It’s an adjustment in techinque more than anything else."
5.0 out of 5 stars,One of the most useful kitchen equipment to own. This has helped me prepare and create food that cuts the traditional by half. There are many recipes online and physical books that you’ll end up using this more often than the stove.
1.0 out of 5 stars,I am very disappointed with this purchase. I have an Instant Pot and love it. I bought this one for my daughter as a present during the holidays. She has tried to use it several times but it burns the food every time. She has contacted the manufacturer several times and they pretty much tell her she is doing something wrong. The pot is obviously defective and the manufacturer should replace it as it is under warranty. My daughter is a Nephrologist...I think she can follow directions.
1.0 out of 5 stars,Not even 5 months old and it broke  .... won’t turn back onNot my first insta pot either ..
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love this Pot!  it does everything it promises.  i am able to set it up the night before to have steel cut oats ready for breakfast, or program it to cook during the day so dinner is ready when i come home.  i have used it to make bone broth, chicken soup, ribs, pulled pork, and can't wait to try many more recipes.  it helps us cut down on the time required for meal prep and come home to a meal.  we love this!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"What can I say...I love this! My friend bought one and was telling me all about it so I had to check out the Amazon reviews and when it went on sale I bought one. My son and husband thinks it's the bomb! Can't believe how delicious all my stews, soups, pulled pork, pot roasts come out and quick too. I use it 2/3 times a week. Need to try a cheese cake next."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This thing is amazing. I haven't quite reached pot head status but I'm obsessed. The best feature is the ability to cook shredded chicken from frozen in 20 minutes. Hands off. I can then have chicken tacos, BBQ sliders, buffalo sliders, enchiladas, chicken salad, chicken noodle soup, you name it. There is a Facebook group dedicated to this appliance in case you ever need ideas or have questions."
1.0 out of 5 stars,"Didn't come with measurements and timing... Rice too hard. Vegetables too soft. Fish crumble, chicken shredded, I stopped using it... Disappointed"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love it. Nothing new to add that others haven’t already said.For reference - it fits an entire gallon of milk in it if you want to make a large batch of yogurt. Also makes 3 quarts of broth and a 4-6 serving meal.Word to the wise. It doesn’t necessarily take less time to cook overall, but you can push a button and walk away to get other things done."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love this thing! After stumbling upon this product a couple of months ago through a youtube video, I finally bit the bullet and purchased the Instant Pot. I am a college student and currently live in a pretty tiny apartment with three other people, so cooking can be challenging (especially since I'm a vegan). I tried this out for the first time yesterday and it was amazing! I was able to make a yummy Mexican potato soup from scratch in around 30 minutes, including prep time. I also really like the fact that clean up is so easy. All I really had to wash was the inner pot and whatever other dishes I used to eat with. This is definitely a huge time saver, and I can see myself eating a lot healthier since it is so easy to make home made dishes. I would highly recommend this product for anyone, especially college students like myself, or those who may struggle in the cooking department (also like myself)!"
1.0 out of 5 stars,"After just a year an a half, the Instant Pot stopped working unexpectedly. I didn't mishandle it. I didn't immerse it in water. Worked great for awhile, but now, just wont turn on. Super disappointed with this."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This machine can be a little intimidating to get started, but once you do, it's amazing! While it is called ""Instant"", be warned it really isn't. Many foods are much faster (un-soaked beans, roasts, any many more) but with the time to come up to pressure and release the pressure, some are the same time as other methods. BUT, with the IP, you don't have to stand over the stove stirring and watching the pot, so it frees you up to multi-task, and with it being in one pot it makes for less dishes and an easier clean up. Check out the official IP Facebook group if you need help getting started, then you'll be hooked!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,I use this thing like crazy. For the most part things turn out well. I hate the steam valve. My aunt recommends unplugging & letting it steam outside. I just throw a towel over it & let it steam into the towel. Cooks things awesome. Lots of uses.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love appliances.  I have so many, but this is by far my favorite.  I have a Cuisinart Pressure Cooker that I didn't like, but this Instant Pot is the bomb.  I cook oatmeal and stew and they are all so dang delicious. I got a great price on Prime day."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"A little daunting to begin using, but the Facebook Instant Pot Group is incredibly helpful.  Once I had learned to use it, I love it and use it all the time.  We are “camping” while the house is being remodeled, and this and the microwave are my only cooking alternatives.  It cooks everything from oatmeal and egggs in the morning, soup for lunch, and 1-Pot stews, pasta, casseroles at night."
5.0 out of 5 stars,Best purchase ever!  Easy to make cold start yogurt and perfect cheesecakes!  Can make every meal in no time! Love this for boiled eggs and baking potatoes and sweet potatoes..  no heat from the oven !  A must have!
1.0 out of 5 stars,I have a pressure cooker since the day I got married 56 years ago. And I loved it! I could make a pot roast in 15/20 minutes. This instant pot takes forever. Returned it and bought regular old fashion one.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"There's nothing not to love about this product. We have been using it nearly daily. Anything you could do in a regular oven, etc. takes 1/2 the time in the IP!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"bought it as a gift for daughter, who really uses it. Like for someone who works, no time and still needs to eat. This allows one to cook several days worth of really good food. Some receipes are multistep and the controls really work through the process with good feed back from the device. Good job you guys."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Wifey and I have been trying to cook more at home.  Problem is, we're still pretty lazy at baseline.The instant pot was recommended to us by numerous friends who swear by it, so we decided to join the club... literally.  On top of hundreds of instant pot recipes on their website: http://instantpot.com/recipes/, there's thousands more online, and even an instant pot facebook page: https://www.facebook.com/instantpot.The unit comes boxed securely and is quite well built and heavy.  The removable pot is stainless steel and very thick, NO non-stick coating, which is better cause the heat and pressure wouldn't be a good idea with teflon-based coatings.  For those who prefer non-stick surfaces, the manufacturer makes them at an option at: https://instantpot.com/store/home.phpThe lid is secure, and pretty easy to wash.  There is a silicone ring on the inside of the lid that should be removed after each session to clean, or food bits and cooking liquids will accumulate.  Settings are pretty self-explanatory and this thing really is set and forget.Lemme say, this thing does a great job and cranks out some tasty food!  You can make true one pot meals with minimal effort.  And not everything you create in this thing has to be stew-like in consistency.  There's settings to saute or brown meats prior to pressure cooking for more flavor and texture.About the only thing I won't make in the instant pot is rice.  While it does an adequate job with rice and grains, my Zojirushi induction rice cooker makes far superior, better tasting, and fluffier rice.  That's okay, the instant pot is a jack of all trades while a dedicated rice cooker excels in one thing.  I'm Asian and VERY picky about my rice, so it's worth it for me to have a separate device for each job.  That said, if you're not real picky about rice, the instant pot will make no fuss rice as well.The price is very reasonable, but the time it'll save for a small family is priceless."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Quick to set up, use, clean up. Soup, chili, pulled pork, stew. One pot start to finish, keeps food warm after the auto shut off. Stainless steel. Made my crock pot and pressure cooker obsolete."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"We like this It's convenient to use w/ instapot. It does seem a little slower than the air fryer we also use w/ toaster oven, but do recommend."
2.0 out of 5 stars,"The device did not work-it would not pressurize.  I worked with customer support at Instant Pot and went through all the steps to ensure it was functioning, but was not successful. The device is not working as expected.  Instant Pot said they would replace it, but it has been three weeks now and we haven't received a replacement. I will work with Amazon to return/replace it. I was looking forward to using it; heard many good things."
5.0 out of 5 stars,I hestitated buying this for a long time. Now that I have it I wish I purchased this years ago. Very easy to understand and use. I have made alot of great meals with this. Looking forward to many more. I highly recommend a instapot for everyone.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"We love this thing.  We use it many times more then the last pressure cooker we had which was stove top.  This is so easy to use and full proof.  One time we put in too little water and it turned off in the middle of cooking.  We thought it might be broken but after looking up the code discovered it senses when the food in the bottom is burning and turns off automatically.  It did it even before anything burned, we just added more water and continued cooking!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love it used twice easy t use and understand. Use to pressure cookers. Highly recommend. Just make sure to clean seal and other pieces each use, when replacing seal make sure correctly inserted. This is not a toy. Highly recommend."
1.0 out of 5 stars,Burn signal keeps coming on. I’ve talked with many other cooks who have no issues with their model of instant pot. I’ve tried for years to get this to work. Finally throwing it in the garbage
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I use it nearly everyday and it's awesome. I haven't  used my oven, pots and pans or crock pot hardly at all since I got this instapot. I would Reccomend the 6 qt. because even if you have a small number to cook for, you never know when a crowd might stop by for a surprise visit at lunchtime. We are a family of 7 and it's just the right size for our family. Works great, and food tastes great. Fast and easy. I love that it stops cooking while your away and keeps food hot until your ready to eat."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"Instant Pot has so many functions. Every night, I use it cooking porridge and press ""warm"" button. When I up in the morning, I can enjoy delicious porridge. It is very useful. But I have to say that it is not very easy to clean. Once being used, there will be some food debris remaining the groove that is pretty difficult to remove. If it is not cleaned very well, it will smell rotten."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've owned many pressure cookers. But this one is the best. It's much safer. I can use it any way I want: slow cooking, pressure cooking, etc. It's easy to clean. The food tastes great in much less time."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I ordered this for my 80 yoa Mom, she is so excited and easy to use for her & easy to clean up, no time consuming on the stove.Thank you so much for selling this Instant pot and also to have it sent to her!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Have only cooked eggs (hard boiled) and chicken (thawed & frozen), and it has performed very well. The instructions are not the greatest, and figuring out certain functions & capabilities is difficult. Looking forward to trying more recipes."
5.0 out of 5 stars,Love it! Easy to use and saves time. I recommend purchasing an extra gasket though. I use 1 gasket for desserts and 1 gasket for regular foods because it seems to hold in food odor that will impart into the dessert. It’s no big deal just to use separate gaskets.  Soaking in Vinegar water does help some but not enough. Other than that it’s great and I use mine all the time!
5.0 out of 5 stars,"So I finally gave in to all the rage and bought one of these things! First meal attempted, Weight Watchers turkey chili and OMG, I am hooked! Took longer to prep the ingredients than to cook it! Amazing and YUMMY! Cannot believe I waited this long to get one. Hubby and I both work and the last thing we want to think about it cooking dinner, but we still want good tasting and healthy meals in the evening. This is the answer!"
4.0 out of 5 stars,"This is a game changer in terms of time savings. You can put all the ingredients in and set it to cook. Most things such as rice cooks in half the time. It does take several minutes for the pressure to lock and then the timer will start. The only challenge is cleaning the lid. There’s a rubber seal and in order to clean it throughly you will need to remove the rubber lining inside the lid and take it apart. This is great for making stew, rice, steamed food, and soups!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This thing is amazing for one pot meals.  Very easy to use and fool proof.  One thing we love to do is ribs.  Season your ribs with your favor seasoning.  Make sure to sprinkle smoked paprika on each rack, both sides, and coil (do not cut ribs) and tie with cotton string or if you prefer butchers string. Not to tight but just enough to hold together.  Cook and enjoy.  You can brown in a hot oven if you like a little more flavor.  But not necessary.  The smoked paprika with make everyone think that the ribs were slow smoked for hours........"
4.0 out of 5 stars,"My only complaint with this is that the controls are a little simplistic and not very user friendly. Making adjustments for cooking the time or temperature are a little annoying if you need to make drastic changes from the last thing you cooked. There's no way to enter favorites or anything, so it's all manual."
5.0 out of 5 stars,New to the instapot and I’m loving it. So easy to use. Instructions were clear. Little tricky to clean but not once you get the hang of it.  Don’t know how I ever lived without it.
3.0 out of 5 stars,We just got ours in the mail today and decided to follow a chicken burrito bowl recipe we found on Pinterest. From start to finish it took about 40 min and the was delicious. The instant pot didn't make any noise when it competed the 10 minute cook time but luckily I was paying attention. I also noticed during clean up that a portion of the lid had melted. I'm left with mixed feelings and hope to resolve the lid issue with the company soon.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Yes, it's true what you've heard: the instant pot will change your life. It's really good with protein. Some of the controls aren't as intuitive as they could be, and I wish there was a way to turn off the sound indicator when your done cooking--it's really loud and can bother my housemates--but it's so good at making proteins of all kinds, soups, broths, etc, that those flaws take it from 6 stars back down to 5. Get one--you'll use it more than you think."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"The vent parts are cumbersome to pry off and clean. But other than that, this is the most used kitchen tool I own. It makes all-day recipes in an hour or two. It can cook DRY beans in about 30 minutes. AMAZING!"
2.0 out of 5 stars,It didn’t cook potatoes a defective one instant pot is the bomb I have 2 the other one being the airfryer duo Awesome!!!!This little one was not good probably a lemon
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Best thing ever! Makes cooking easier and if you hate cooking, the you will love this even more. You can just about do anything in here. Cooking times are cut down and meat comes out tender and yummy. We have cooked hard boiled eggs, steal cut oatmeal, stew, chicken thighs....and so much more."
5.0 out of 5 stars,My old pressure cooker had a removable power cord which made for neater storage. The slow cooker function didn’t seem to get hot enough. I need to do a slow cooker temperature test
2.0 out of 5 stars,I was excited to finally get this. Bought it suppose to be new. But why is there a dent and why does it look like there was sticker on it by the rent. Was it a display. It’s a gift and bought full brand new price. Ugh!!
5.0 out of 5 stars,A little bit different than my old one.  Just wanted a second for back up.. and couldn't pass up at that price.  I'm a big fan of the instant pot.  I have cooked with it for over five years now.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have never used a pressure cooker before.  I liked this one because it does not have to go on the stove.  It is very easy to use and has good directions.  I make rice and/or lentils all the time.  It is almost fool proof.  I have mixed up the time on some recipes and it still came out fine.  It is also easy to clean up.  I prefer browning the meat in a separate pan because of the room' but you don't have to it that way. I like being able to put in the ingredients, pushing one or two buttons and walking away.  Lovely."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Works great.  I am a long-time stove top pressure cooker user with several pots for different uses.  I wanted something that I could walk away from  but was unsure about the electric pressure cooker.  After research, I felt like the Instant Pot would be the best candidate.  I have not been disappointed.  I have pressure cooked everything from potatoes, dried beans (I always pre-soak overnight) and Christmas pudding (a first).  I found that very little time adjustments were needed from my stove top cookers (I am very pleased with these but for things requiring a lot of time cooking can be time consuming).  I would say that I am ""pleasantly surprised""."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love this instant pot. I use it more than I use my stove! Easy to use, loads of great recipes on line. Great quality and a super time saver when making dinner"
3.0 out of 5 stars,"Received damaged, the outside box and shipping box was fine but the instant pot has a dent in the side."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This was purchased as a gift for my boyfriend who does most of the cooking.  WE BOTH LOVE IT!  He's cooked in it for every meal since he received it.  The meat turns out so tender in this pressure cooker, that it just falls apart.  Roasts, chicken breast, Everything comes out amazing, and tastes so much better than cooking off the flavor in pots and pans, or food getting dried out in the oven.  WE recommend this for everyone who cooks!  And make sure to buy the 8 Qt.  We are actually considering getting another one, so we can cook multiple meals at once for the holidays."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"The Instant Pot electric pressure is somewhat easy to use after reading the manual and watched some YouTube videos.One great thing that was unexpected is that in pressure cooking mode, it's silent.  At first, I thought I wasn'tprograming it correctly.  Some of my cons are unlike a stovetop pressure cooker which gives you ratios onall single food items: food + water + cook time, the Instant Pot doesn't.  Instead, it only gives you recipes, which are not familiar nor interesting at all to me."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought this Instant Pot as a replacement for my crockpot.  I wanted all the features of a slow cooker and a pressure cooker without having to make room for yet another kitchen implement.  I thought it would be a simple swap. Not so!  The pressure cooker works as expected.  The slow cooker is a total disappointment.  I made my standard slow cooker roast in this IP, on the same setting (high) for the same amount of time (5.5 hours) as I cook it in my crockpot.  In my crockpot the roast comes out tender enough to cut with a fork.  After 5.5 in the IP the roast was so tough it was inedible.  As it turns out I don't really use the pressure cooker that much.  Wish I had just bought an upgraded crockpot.UPDATE:  I contacted IP about the issue with the slow cooker feature.  They are sending me a new cooker base.  What a response!  Very impressed with their customer service."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Basically an outstanding appliance...I didn't find the instructions for using the device to be the easiest to follow, but am becoming more comfortable with it. I think more photos of each step of the different cooking settings would be appropriate. I know my sister was given one as a gift, and I hear she is somewhat intimidated by it, so simplified instructions would be helpful....something like Instant Pot for Dummies?"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I waited a year to buy this because I didn’t think I would ever use it. Wow, was I wrong! It’s my daily “go to” appliance. I’ve made tons of savory and sweet dishes."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love this thing.  I am vegan and my husband isn't, and thanks to this we can both get a fresh hot meal at dinner.  Everything I have made has come out well, and the stainless steel pot is so much easier to clean than the one in my rice cooker (which is now gathering dust) and my slow cooker - which both can't be washed in the dishwasher, and the instant pot can.  I just wish the recipes in chinese in the book were the same ones in the English side, because they look good!  Best part- I can saute the spices and aromatic veggies first, then dump everything else in and pressure cook, so all the flavor gets in there."
1.0 out of 5 stars,OMG i thought this is gonna be a set that i can cooking right away but it's only a lid!? So i yave to but a pot too!? Why i have to pay a 100 for only a lid!? Since tgey has a little lot of brands that get with full set. Maybe I'm stupid because i wanna buy something that easy to cook since I'm bad at cooking and be dumb with only a lid! With no explanation that you need a pot clearly. Now i waste my Time to return it and get another that come with the full set (cry)
5.0 out of 5 stars,I have used this pressure cooker twice now and I absolutely love it.  I made an entire pot of beef stew tonight in 45 minutes.  It kept the stew warm for hours even while turned off.  At first I thought it wasn't working as it is totally silent but when I released the pressure oh boy did it work.  I love this cooker and if you are in the market for one I would recommend getting this.  It's just what a busy working woman needs.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"We bought this figuring it would be ""handy"" to have. Wrong, we use it 3 to 4 times a week because it is so versatile. This unit has a way to make everything taste SO good. We are more than satisfied with this. We almost bought another brand, but we liked the fact that the Instant Pot has a very good stainless steel pot that the food goes into, rather than a pot that has a non-stick coating that can come off. We highly recommend this unit!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is what I have been missing my entire life. So many things that can made, very quick. Was a little reserved with using a pressure cooker, but use it almost every couple days."
5.0 out of 5 stars,I love my instant pot! I actually used it for portions of Christmas dinner and it was quick and awesome! I should have purchased the ultra so I could actually see the total cooking time! That is the only negative...  can't determine how long it will take to warm up/cool down before it will unlock!
5.0 out of 5 stars,"All in one, its been used as a pressure cooker, slow cooker and to saute already, easy to use, easy to clean, lots of great recipes online for free, experiment and enjoy, just keep your face safely away from the steam vent!  For those of us who hate cleaning multiple pots and pans when one will do, this is a godsend!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"If you do not have an instapot - you're missing out. I can't believe I used a rice cooker before for most of cooking, now I can't even see myself without one. The quality also comes out much better than rice cooker (rice (white/brown), stews, beans, veggies)."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is a Black Friday deal I will never forget. It is an amazing product I've gotten so much use out of. When your able to cook a roast with the same level of flavor and moistness in 30 minutes that would normally take all day, the money you spent will be well worth it. There are so many different features it's unbelievable! Chicken cooks in 10 minutes and you can even steam vegetables within minutes!!!! One of the best purchases ever, the only negative I've come across is the plastic insert within the pot does seem to get a smell quite quickly. Fortunately, replacement parts can be bought.Pros:Design.Great price for value.Multifunctional, numerous ways to use this pot.Cons:Plastic components develop an unpleasant smell quickly, namely the inside ring.Requires a good amount of maintenance, for safe use."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I use my IP almost every day, and sometimes multiple times a day to make bone broth, main dishes and sides for my family of six.  I love it for reducing cooking time and intensifying flavor.  It is also easy to keep clean.  I've had zero problems with food stuck to the stainless steel pot, and I wish that I could wipe off all my stainless steel appliances, smudge free, as easily as my IP.  When I need to make more soup than a 6-qt. pot allows, I cook part of the ingredients in the pressure cooker, then stir them into a larger pot on the stove top.  I am looking forward to the debut of the 8-qt. Instant Pot."
5.0 out of 5 stars,This 8 qt version is absolutely wonderful for cooking for large family meals or just cooking for 2.  I use it consistently 3-4 times per week.  The versatility of this item is exquisite as it is so multi-faceted. I would recommend this product to everyone!
5.0 out of 5 stars,My daughter and daughter in-law love it. I am trying to use it but I have not mastered it. I must not using it correctly. I made ribs and they were falling off the bone. I made Spanish rice and I must have not put enough water and it burned. I am sure it’s the user not using correctly. I am use to just adding my  ingredients without measuring. I am trying to use the book on how to cook different foods. I am sure if and when I master it I will like it.
5.0 out of 5 stars,This thing is great.  Set it and forget it.  I put a whole chicken in my 8qt IP and within 30-45min. I have falling off the bone chicken.  I like cooking chicken in it because it cooks in its own juices; I end up with good chicken stock that I can use for other dishes.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my new kitchen toy. My mom had a pressure cooker and you couldn't talk over it because it was so loud.  This is easy, silent, fast, and everything advertised. You tube is full of recipes and hints for it. I have used it almost every day since receiving it. I've made everything from creme caramel to barbeque ribs. So glad I bought it. It not only pressure cooks but has settings for slow cook, saute, rice, meat, and the 6 qt. stainless steel insert is so easy to clean. Great purchase!!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Since purchasing this, I am able to cook so much faster. And as a result I cook a lot more often. I save money on eating out, and time in the kitchen. I wish I would have bought this sooner."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Most amazing invention ever !  I love that their are so many recipes out there for anything you want to make !  What took me so long to buy one ?!  I love it!  These dials are very sensitive though, but once you get used to it you can really customize cooking temps!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love this product and would buy it again. I love doing ""boiled eggs"" in it. I do 1 dozen with 1 c of water and set it for 5 minutes. You have to keep in mind when cooking anything, it needs time to get to temp, then cool down time. But with eggs, they peel so well!!!!  My husband made ribs in it and they were fantastic!  Love it for quick maco and cheese too."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"The box arrived quickly...and the IP and I spent a few days sizing each other up. I was hesitant, intimidated, suspicious. I google beginner recipies which still didn't comfort me. Everyone raved about this machine and I was frozen in fear. I'm a picky eater and wfpb newbie. It's a bit overwhelming. Also, I'm not one to follow recipies precisely. I like to just dump stuff together and see what happens. Sooo-I threw in 1 cup of jasmine rice, 1 cup water, and 2 cups almond milk and a handful of raisins. Manual 7min. Taadaa! Rice pudding. I'm in love! I can also make soup-all of which starts with 1 cup of Bob's red milk veggie/lentil soup base and veggie broth... adjusted flavor with cans of tomato products or frozen fire roasted veggies. It's working-the kids eat it too! Yay! Go for it! I may even try a recipe!?"
1.0 out of 5 stars,"Just after couple of uses, the coated teflon keeps peeling off - dangerous chemicals can be leaking onto our food. Not recommended."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"For the last several months, this is the go to appliance in our home (largely Indian recipes). Dramatically cuts down time. Supremely versatile. What's more, when we had a problem, Instant Pot responded rapidly to our requests, asked us to take a few pictures, and within a couple of days, we had a new base, and we humming once again. Since this purchase, we bought the mini version as a gift for a college going student, and got another mini for ourselves. Could not be happier."
5.0 out of 5 stars,Has saved my family incredibly valuable time in the kitchen while providing us with quality nutritious food! You can get tips online for recipes and then tweak them to suit your own personal taste. FUN and FAST results!
5.0 out of 5 stars,Love my instant pot duo.  What more can I say.  Replaced our slow cooker with it and have never regretted it.  Lots of cooking videos for this on the web.  Just a great product and I recommend it.
2.0 out of 5 stars,"I don't know if it is me or the machine, but I cannot get it to work properly. It didn't occur to me to return it that it was probably it. I let the time get by me before someone told me it wasn't me, but in fact the machine was faulty. Oh well I am disappointed for sure."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"My Pros Once you've washed and seasoned your meat, you're basically done making your meal (just put it in the pot and forget it!). One the cook time stops, the pot automatically goes to keep warm. I've tried all the preset timers for poultry, meat/ stews. The meat comes out perfectly cooked every time. The con is, it's a pressure cooker, it creates a lot of water. At the end of the cycle, I usually sauté my meats for about 5 mins to thicken the sauce/ gravy (not bad since I probably just saved 2 hrs of stirring had I cooked the conventional way). Poultry cooks soft to the bone in 15 mins. The bone melts in your mouth. Meats/ stews cooks soft in 25-30 mins. If you work, and you like cooked meals that you don't mind sautéing in the same instant pot to get rid of extra water, get this pot!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I got Instant Pot becasue I'm pesco-vegetarian (perfect for steaming fish and vegetables) and now trying to cook without oil. It first the idea of pressure cooking was little bit overwhelming, but when I got to cook for the first time in it ( basmati rice medley ) it was the best rice I ever had. Pasta, eggs, fish. You name it - it will cook for you.All in only one pot.  The multi functional options are waiting for your finger to be pushed. It is so easy to use and to clean. Making meal in 10-20 minutes makes life so much easier and the best part is....the nutritions are still there because time of cooking is so short. I don't know why took me so long to buy this smart device, because now it's my new best friend.;)"
5.0 out of 5 stars,This replaces your pressure cooker and slow cooker. Great appliance used 2-3 times/week for meats and veggies. Easy prep and clean up. Meal in a pot!
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I got the instant pot for Christmas and have already used it several times to make soup, desserts, and even a fresh berry compote to mix in with my yogurt. I've liked it so much that a few of my friends have already went on amazon and purchased their own based on my posts about the instant pot! Highly recommend but definitely be cautious when opening the lid."
5.0 out of 5 stars,Love this!  I've already tried several recipes.  Not very specific directions.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I took the advice of the reviews posted on amazon to make my selection.  They were right on.  It's easy to use and clean.  I bought one for myself and one as a gift.  The person for whom I bought one as a gift uses it 2-4 times per week.  I was always afraid of pressure cookers, but this takes the worry away.  I would recommend this to anyone interested in trying their first pressure cooker.  Food comes out tender, flavorful and just plain yummy.  There is a nice cookbook included with great recipes for all of us novices to try. This product is a good bang for the buck !"

   So happy with my insta pot! Works so good! I made chicken stew in 10 min. I basically just dropped everything (ingredients) inside the pot and sealed.Will update in two months.The only problem I see is “how do you wash the lid?”"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Instant Pot is a wonder - dinner can be ready in 15 - 30 minutes - from FROZEN!!  Whooo hooooo!  I like the timer feature too, I can set this up to start cooking close to the time I'm expected to get home.  Instant Pot does it's thing and keeps the food warm.  Excellent!  This was a gift to myself and I'm so glad I decided to buy this.  Between work, kids, extra-curricular activities and just life in general - busy is not the word.Instant Pot makes cooking easy, healthier and clean up is simple!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I am a vegetarian and this pot makes the best beans, lentils and soups that I have ever had. The flavors of the spices become infused while cooking quickly. You don't get this kind of flavor stove top and the saute feature means that you can prepare everything in just one pot. AMAZING!"
3.0 out of 5 stars,"After three years of trying to like this, I gave up. It took as much time due to buildup release time as regular cooking. Found it hard to store. Found it time consuming to use. The oven works better for me at low heat settings regarding the outcome and the amounts cooked are not limited. It came with silicone gaskets you have to use and replace as necessary. Upkeep. Heavy and hard to clean. Never could figure out the sweet spot and got raw or mush depending on the choices. Just did not make my life easier, or better. My choice. It had to go."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Fabulous cooking product, upgraded to newer model and moved earlier version to summer home, everything from pot roast to soups have come wonderful, easy clean up, one pot cooking"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Instant Pots are AWESOME!There is a learning curve and I had a comfort curve to get over but now I use it with ease. It is so easy and so great for busy families like my own.I already had the 6 qt but when the price dropped on Black Friday, I knew I had to snag the 8 qt one.The bigger size is great."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"LOVE LOVE LOVE!!! Everything that I have made with this has tasted great!!  The only issue I am having is food sticking to the bottom when I sauté and if I dont scrape it off well enough, especially with tomato paste, I get the burn error, but I think that if I add a bit more oil to the pan when sautéing meat and  deglaze better when cooking with tomato paste I would have no issues at all!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I received this item as a gift for Christmas. I absolutely loved it! I used it about 8 times between Jan & March.  It worked great until about a week ago.  I received a C6 error which is a pressure sensor problem.  I called Instant Pot customer service on 3/5/18.  I received an email from Instant Pot customer service within a couple of hours after speaking to them requesting a picture of the serial number, the silver sticker on the back, and the invoice.  I emailed them with the requested info 03/06/2018. I received an email a few hours later stating that they would send me an email with tracking information for my new Instant Pot base.  On 03/09/2018 I received an email with tracking information.  I have tracked it and its in route. I should have it 03/14/18.  Great customer service and great item."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Bought this as a gift for Mom... It is amazing how much time you can save by using a good pressure cooker like this one. It is very easy to use, can auto-sense for certain types of food, and is faster and more efficient than things like a non-pressurized rice cooker. You can use it for all kinds of things, from chili to rice to oatmeal to dry beans. I continue to be impressed at how many different things can be quickly made in this pressure cooker, yet the results have the same flavor and texture as if you cooked them on a stove pot (just in much less time!)"

4.0 out of 5 stars,"Beware when you receive your purchase! You are not missing the anti-block shield! The design has changed and the manual is not updated. The anti-block shield shown in the manual is oval and large enough to cover both the float valve and the pressure release at once but the new design is a smaller, round shield that covers the pressure release only. See update manual here: [...]"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I didn't have a chance to use but gave it to my son when he moved in with his fiance. He uses it at least three times a week and loves it (maybe too much, his fiance gives him dirty looks whenever he starts cooking with it)."
3.0 out of 5 stars,Ask anyone that has a instant pot you just end up using manual mode so the rice function etc you dont even need. Buy a low cost one with the size you need and you'll be fine. Also it is hard to clean the silicone rubber thing so you just end up leaving it in the lid and using soapy water and a rag to clean it and let it air dry! Too hard to remove that ring!
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I wish I would have had this year's ago! What an amazing product. The time it saves is awesome . Frozen chicken breast cooked in 20 minutrs, frozen fish with  rice cooked to perfection in 10 min, dried beans in 45 minutes and homemade yogurt. Saves time and energy. Meals done in a matter of minutes not hours like the crock pot"
5.0 out of 5 stars,Really cooks great lots of recipes and easy to use and clean up.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Don't know why it took so long to purchase. Love this machine. So happy I bought it, remodeling and kitchenette in the make shift laundry room. Best home cooked meal in months. More to come for sure. Highly recommend."
5.0 out of 5 stars,Haven’t used it as much as I thought I would. It is very quick and makes cooking much easier. Most of the meat has come out nice and tender.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have been looking at the Instant Pot for the last 2 years but already having 2 stovetop pressure cookers I thought I didn't really need one.  Well I bought this one on sale and now I wish I would have bought one sooner.  Sautéing in the same pot you are going to cook in, it seems to come up to pressure much quicker than the stovetop models I had, the stainless steel insert and the thing I love the most is you can set it and not have to keep a constant eye on the pressure as it is all automatic and when done cooking is done goes to warm automatically.  I bought the cookbook that they recommended with it plus there are a lot of recipes and helpful hints on YouTube, Facebook, and Pinterest.  I can't recommend it enough.  I would definitely buy it again if something would happen to this one."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great way to extend the use of the Instant Pot. Product works great and as expected. Packaging comes with entirely too much plastic, but that’s not a con on the product itself."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"How did I live so long without an Instant Pot?  I'm obsessed with this thing.  I like to buy kitchen gadgets and this is the best one I've ever purchased!  I'm making my first ever cheese cake in it today and can't wait.  There are many great Instant Pot Facebook Groups and it's very helpful when you have questions and also to share recipes, etc."
5.0 out of 5 stars,This is a great purchase.  I have used it for making hard boiled eggs and the shells just slip right off.  I have also made several pressure cooker meals and it is easy to use and easy to clean up.  I will use more in the winter months when I cook more.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have to say this sat in the box, probably for 5-6 months, before I decided to use it.  My husband bought, and put in panty, where it was quickly forgotten.  I watched my daughter use hers, and I was hooked.  It cooks so quickly, that I don't even have to start dinner until an hr later than usual.  Use it on a weekly basis."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"We love this thing, what more can I say. Fall off the bone ribs in about an hour. Amazing pot roast. If you don’t have one you need one."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"What a functional, time saving fun toy.  It makes everything from pot-roasts to cheese cake.  I gave my crock pot to Goodwill.  Only downside is the odor stays with the pot.  Cleaning is very difficult.  I've soaked the pot in vinegar over night to get rid of the odor and get stains gone.  My issue!  Eating is still great!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,I hesitated for over a year before I finally made the purchase. I’m so happy I did! It cooks amazing!! Takes a little while to heat before you start cooking so it’s not as fast as they make it sound. But it’s wonderful!
5.0 out of 5 stars,Love the Instant Pot brand. Best pressure cooker out there. So many ways to cook your food and safely. I love the way it makes the flavor stay in carrots and other veggies. Now I need another size!
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I like the quick way food can be prepared in less time then stove top cooking. It takes some practice to learn how to used the instant pot,Utube vidios helped with how to use the pot."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"So I've been using this cooker for a couple of months and I love it.  It is great for making stocks, beans, rice, soup, etc.  It is very convenient.  What they advertise as the cooking times is a bit misleading.  It is the ""cooking time under preassure"" not the entire time that the food will be in the pot.  I guess they don't count the preheating as cooking time.  It was troubling at first but the set and forget process of cooking quickly overcame that misleading advertisement."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"We've cooked something every night in it since we received it!  Family is trying to be plant-based, but I am sure there would be far more options if we were omnivores!  We feel it's already paid for itself with what we've used it for!!  My new obsession will be buying accessories for it!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,I usually stay away from kitchen gadgets and gimmicks but I honestly love the Instant Pot. I use it about twice a week. Its essentially an easy to use pressure cooker that cuts braising time from hours to minutes. I think it makes superior stock compared to stove top pots.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Honestly, instant pots are what makes sure food in your refrigerator will always get utilized.Pro-tip: download Yummly and flourish with endless recipes."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I made corn on the cob and potatoes in 10 minutes!  I purchased this to keep from heating up my oven during the summer.  So far I have also made pork chops, a small ham in brown sugar and a few other foods."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I LOVE my Instant Pot and all that I have been able to cook so far. The only problem I continue to have is user error, lol. I have forgotten more than once to set the pressure knob to SEALING, so after I wait and wait and wait it doesn't build pressure, then I realize what I've done (or not done, as it were). NOT a problem with the pot, just something I need to learn to do!  I really could not be more pleased."
5.0 out of 5 stars,Wonderful kitchen tool! FYI- the manual control for time is actually the “pressure cook” button. It took me forever to figure that out. Otherwise the time goes in increments.
4.0 out of 5 stars,"Love this item!  I had an stove top pressure cooker and was always uncertain on how to cook things.  This is wonderful because of the variety of things you can cook in it.  I have made soup, chuck roast, rice, brown meat, beans, etc.  It does tell you not to use it for pasta because the foam from the starch gets into the pressure valve.  I had a rice make and crock pot. and the pressure cooker.  For a small kitchen it was  going from 3 appliances to one.  The removable inner pot is stainless steel.  It cleans up beautifully."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"The instant pot was a Christmas gift to my daughter.  She's a great cook, but spends a great deal of time on many of her meals.  She says the instant pot is one of the best gifts she's ever receive.  She's able to cook any meal she wants and they all cook quickly.  She now has time to enjoy her evenings after a long day at work."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Overall a 5 star rating. It arrived fast and intact. The quality of construction appears high and everything fits together well. The instructions were clear and with pictures to make it easier to understand. The only downside is the seal retains the odors of the last thing that was cool in it. Heard this is common. Also, there are some copycat products that do not hold up."
3.0 out of 5 stars,"Mini description stated 3 qt. pot -adequate for 1-2 persons, BUT instructions warned against filling only 2.3 to 1/2 full when using.  That makes the use of this size pot limited.  I am returning it."

5.0 out of 5 stars,"I can’t give this thing enough praise. Life changing, amazing, can’t imagine living without it again!!! We are a family of 7 so fast large quantity cooking is a must. I can’t even write the many things we’ve made in this pot over the last 2 years in a review but a quick google search of anything you want to cook plus instant pot will show you. And it’s safe to use."
5.0 out of 5 stars,Honestly has cut down cooking time and increased quality family time here.Especially easy to use. Makes meals in minutes and tenderizes our chicken -  FROZEN UNTHAWED CHICKEN- it is short cooking time. Go for it! Very worth the investment.
5.0 out of 5 stars,My wife has used this almost every single day since receiving it as a Christmas gift — sometimes multiple times a day. The food that she cooks in it is really good! My only complaint is that you have to hold the valve open to manually release the pressure/steam. Seems to me that you should be able to turn it and leave it to depressure.
5.0 out of 5 stars,Game changer for meal prep! Especially with frozen chicken or fish! Time saver for sure! My dishes for salmon & chicken have never tasted better! Wow!!
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Definitely a good product.  I got this on sale on prime day.  I do not eat meat  so i cant speak for its ability there.  It cooks a pound of beans start to finish under an hour and they taste just as good.  The veggie steam part works perfect, faster than stove top  and it doesn't heat the house up, That is a huge plus!  It cooks rice just as good as my rice cooker but faster.  I had a traditional pressure pot but i never used it, just to cumbersome.  This makes pressure cooking incredible simple and safe.  Great product."
5.0 out of 5 stars,These were gifts and I myself have one.  LOVE love love it.  It has made cooking some meals healtgier and quicker.  Thank you Fr. Gundry and Plant Paradox for re-introducing me to healthier eating.  The insta pot makes it all a lot easier.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I just barely got my Instant Pot recently and I've already used it for several things. It's so versatile and makes cooking quick dinners so easy. I love making grains, beans and soups in mine. I love that it comes with a recipe booklet to reference quickly for cooking times and ratios. I definitely recommend the 6 qt. as it can handle making plenty of food for 2 or more people. I'm looking forward to trying it out for different things in the near future!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I already loved my instant pot...but this thing made me love it more. So far, we've cooked steak tips numerous times, and beef jerky. The steak tips taste like they just came off the grill, and I'm a grill snob!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have had this for several months now. Simply cannot imagine life without it. Steamed corn in 5-7 minutes from start to finished. Meat directly from the freezer to the table in about 45 minutes, or less. Amazing bone broth in about 3 hours. Hard boiled eggs in 3 minutes cooking time. Wished this had been available when my family was young what a difference it would have made to dinner time stress. It is a time saver food is health, nutritious, and delicious."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have challenged the very integrity of the *Instant Pot* as I continue to be amazed.  ""My Precious"" has been with me since August of 2015, and the only changes are, the silicone rings;  that allow this beauty, to be as illuminating has the day it was forged."

5.0 out of 5 stars,"This ""cooker"" should be called the ""Kitchen Dream Machine""! All seven functions work flawlessly, and the stainless steel insert is incredibly easy to clean, even if you've seared meat prior to slow cooking. The Quick Start Guide will help you to learn how to use the pot, which might seem a bit overwhelming at first. Two shortcomings: Would have liked a much better cook book inside, and a plastic lid for the insert would make life easier for leftovers. Apart from that, this devise quickly became a household necessity; it's worth every penny!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"once you make your first Instant Pot beans recipe, you'll never buy canned beans again. i love this appliance and am so happy we finally pulled the trigger on it. do yourself a favor and get it - it's not just for pot roasts!"

A fall off the bone pork shoulder in 50 min.  4 cups of Jasmine rice in 4 min, spaghetti squash in 7min...... I can keep going on but I think you get the hint that I love this machine. I even ended up by the 8qt.  The other thing is although it is fast the taste of the food is of the highest quality."
5.0 out of 5 stars,I was a little hesitant to get it.  My rice cooker died and I was looking to replace it. This works so well replaced the rice cooker and slow cooker with this.  Works amazing especially when your a busy parent that needs to cook dinner.It seems to be very well made and very safe.The instructions are pretty minimal but the device is pretty easy to use.  Plenty of recipes on the web.  I am very happy with it.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This pot is AMAZING!! I have had it for almost a year and use it 5-6 times a week. There is a learning curve so I recommend doing some research before trying it out. I watched some videos on YouTube and read some blogs on Pinterest. I use it for everything!! Weekly meal prep, breakfast, dinner, desserts, you name it. Definitely a hit with the family and makes weeknight meals quickly."
5.0 out of 5 stars,I honestly do not know why I did not purchase one of these sooner. I love crock pot meals but hate that they take so long and there is always an uncertainty with leaving the food at home but this works so well and cooks so much faster. Completely worth the splurge and will be purchasing a larger Instant Pot in the future!
5.0 out of 5 stars,Was a gift for my daughter. She has been delighted

5.0 out of 5 stars,"Don't worry if you are tight on cupboard space--you won't need it.  You'll never put it away!  I use my Instant Pot nearly every day, sometimes two or three times.  Upgrading to the 8 quart for my family of six was a great decision, and I like the features of the Duo."
1.0 out of 5 stars,"I ordered the Instant Pot slightly used but in good condition. It came with the instant pot and steam rack but did not contain the condensation collector (necessary to use), measuring cup, soup spoon, rice paddle, quick reference guid, recipe book or manual.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have thought about buying a pressure cooker for years but never knew if I would actually use it.  Because it's my first one, I can't compare it to anything, but I love it.  I haven't made a bad meal yet.  The meat is just amazing and so tender.  My biggest concern in using a pressure cooker has always been the safety issue but I am not concerned at all with this one because of the safety features they have.  I would totally recommend it."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"LOVE THIS PRODUCT. Cuts cooking time by hours!! I typically make soups, stews, or braised ribs that can take 3-4 hours. Its down to half an hour with this guy! We even eat hot pot out of it (set to sautee)."

3.0 out of 5 stars,"It’s best feature is definitely the versatility, there are so many dishes it can cook and so many instant pot recipes online. It’s issue is definitely the cleaning. I use dishwasher to clean the inner pot, but it never cleans it perfectly, so I end up hand cleaning it, which is what I was trying to avoid"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Downsizing to move into a tiny house and have thoroughly tested this.  I can happily sacrifice my rice cooker, crockpot, and all my cooking pots.  I'll now only need a couple of pans for the couple of things this can't do.  Pintrest also has some super amazing ideas for recipes and the healthy possibilities are incredible.  My only advice is that anyone that hasn't used one before must be sure the arrows that line up for the lid to close must be perfectly lined up to lock.  I spent a few frustrated minutes sure I was doing everything correctly but unable to close the lid.  I was close, but after discovering the is no wiggle room on this I no longer have any problems.  It's actually quite reassuring how careful they are with every component.  I have every confidence in my safety now, and I've yet to have a problem getting a properly cooked meal.  My meals have been flavorful, meat falls off the bone, veggies cook to perfection every time, and seasoning might actually be better in a pressure cooker.  I speculate that the steam not being released until the cooking cycle is complete is the reason, but that's only an idea of mine.  Regardless I recommend it for anyone that wishes to save time, space, or complexity.  Nearly any level of cooking skill can use this.  My brother-in-law recommended this and he was never a cook until he got this pot.  He made a deconstructed lasagna for us that convinced me that it's easy to use for anyone that is willing to look up a recipe and do the prep work.  The delay function is also amazing if you work all day and don't like to cook when you get home.  The pot will have it ready and hot for you when you get back and no steam loss, means it doesn't dry out, get that skin on the surface, or taste overcooked.  Not sure what else you could want from this."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Best kitchen item for anyone who likes to cook healthy meals and for anyone who likes to cook one pot meals!  Cooking is so easy- literally push a button!  I make yogurt, soups and stews, hot cereals, steamed veggies and meat so tender, it cuts like butter!I especially love the ease of making chili!  I can brown my meat and onions using the saute features and then simply add my remaining ingredients and push the stew button!  Thats it!!!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,Best part about this that differs from the same version 6 quart is that THE CORD IS ATTACHED TO THE MACHINE which is essential AND with the 8 quart version you have to press even less buttons to make it go!  Even MORE convenient!
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love this product.  Where it has taken multiple pieces of cookware to prepare a dish this pot does it all.  Tonight in the same pot I sauted,  I pressure cooked, I used it as a crockpot,  and then as a warmer to keep my white chili ready to serve.  I have used this pot for simple to more complex dishes....I love the results."
5.0 out of 5 stars,Love the Instant Pot.  So much quieter than a conventional pressure cooker.  Recommend it with no reservations.
3.0 out of 5 stars,"Pros: It has many functions or modes for cooking, good for pressure cooking lentils and pulses quickly, which generally take lot of time in regular cookers.Cons: you have to set time manually, not useful for cooking rice,  difficult to clean, not easy to use."
5.0 out of 5 stars,You can find sooooo many recipes online to make for dinner and everything turns out lovely once you get the hang of it! Messed up a couple meals due to not reading recipe instructions correctly regarding pressure level. 10/10 recommend!
5.0 out of 5 stars,Everyone should have one of these in your kitchen! Whether you’re too busy to cook or like to just keep things simple while still eating a great meal- this is for you! So many good recipes and uses. The best part is it is SUPER EASY to clean! Most meals you can do in just this one pot and it cleans up in just minutes!
4.0 out of 5 stars,"It was cheaper than at CostXX, I have a 12 yo SS pressure cooker that I no longer use cuz my new Insta Pot does it quicker, easy'er, and with less heat dumped into the kitchen. Last I can do so much more with the Insta Pot .  Con: pot still takes good scrubbing to clean, probably due to hard water."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"So far, we have loved almost everything we have cooked in this unit and have had no issues, but the gaskets seem to retain the last thing cooked in them and they are hard to clean the smell from."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have joined the ranks of Instant Pot lovers. This is a great pressure cooker! There are tons of recipes out there on the Internet, as well as tons of how-to videos on YouTube. There is also a Facebook group for IP users. Although many foods can be made more quickly in the Instant Pot (ex: black bean soup), not everything is faster. However, almost everything is BETTER in the IP. IP cheesecake alone makes this worthwhile! :)"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Fabulous new appliance!  Steamed eggs right from under the chicken - perfectly hard steamed and super easy to peel.  Made 3 cheesecakes so far all came out perfectly.  Cooked ribs, both pork and beef, made bean soup (did not soak the beans prior), rice and other grains.  Sauté function and all others very easy to use and most efficient.  I can't be happier.  The stovetop though feels neglected.  It's not been used much. :-)"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've had all of these appliances (rice cooker, pressure cooker, slow cooker, etc) at one point but this truly is handy to have an all-in-one appliance to take all their place."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I don’t know what I did before without this! Love my instant pot! Can meal prep quickly, and have been able to make such a variety of delicious meals in such a short amount of time!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,I like it but it takes some getting use to and cleaning should be done right after so it doesn't stain.  I have cooked meat and pasta meals it tastes better than using traditional methods.  I can't wait to try  a dessert in it.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Once you know all the controls you are on your way to being a great chef. each model is different plus some of the recipes guide you with controls on their model. Yes , we love it so go get one"
1.0 out of 5 stars,"For me, this product has not met my expectations. I had to return one, it was replaced in a very timely manner, However, I am now experiencing trouble. It is not operating the way it was advertized.  Even cooking hard boiled eggs!  They didn't cook!It does not build up the pressure the way it is supposed to.  I'm very unhappy with it. I have purchased many accessories as I planned to use it alot, but now, for the second time, it has proved to be a bad product for me."
1.0 out of 5 stars,"It takes forever to cook what ever I cook even if its on high pressure.  It doesnt deposit the water it makes in the little plastic container it brings. I constantly have touch the vent air button and hold it so ir can let the air out because if you don't , you can't open the lid ."
1.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought this for the purpose of making yogurt.  I've been making yogurt for more than 30 years without a dedicated yogurt maker, but I thought, from the reviews, that this would be easier, since lately I've been having a bit of trouble keeping the incubation temperature consistent.  I also thought it might permit me to get rid of my large rice cooker, which I seldom use, and my old style non-electric pressure cooker, which I also rarely use.I followed the yogurt instructions exactly.  As instructed, I pressed the yogurt setting, after placing the milk in the interior pan and closing the unit.  The yogurt did heat to the 180 F temperature.  After many many hours, it cooled to the 115 F temperature, and I added the culture, as per instructions.  After the appropriate number of hours, I opened it.  The milk was brown, and cooked onto the bottom of the pot.  I took its temperature, and it had heated to 143 degrees F, even though it had been at 115 when I added the culture.  Obviously, the overheating killed the culture.If you want to make yogurt, I do not recommend this product. I cannot speak to its other uses, as I am returning it today."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I am having a lot of fun using my instapot. I cook a whole chicken once a week  for sandwich meat and the poultry setting cooks the frozen chicken to juicy perfection without having to add any oils or butter. I also love the saute feature because for my stews and sauces, I like to brown up the onions and garlic before I add liquids. With the instapot, I save time and dishes doing everything in just one appliance. It also helps me keep my kitchen cooler than cooking on the stove. Love this purchase. 😁"
5.0 out of 5 stars,I've been giving these as gifts and finally got one myself. I've used it twice but both times were great and a dinner saver. The app with the recipes makes it easy for new user to delve right in and begin cooking.
2.0 out of 5 stars,I bought an instant pot for my daughter a few months ago. She didn’t open it until after the return time closed. It was broken. The upper black rim was cracked to the point of there being some small pieces in the box.Good news- I contacted Instant Pot and they responded immediately and are sending me a new pot.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought it once before, and I was very satisfied after using it. This is the second one, and I bought it as a gift."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Just. Love. It. Favorite thing to make: add the bones from a rotisserie chicken and water. Pressure cook for a few hours, and you got chicken stock! Rice is perfect every time, white or brown. Yogurt is perfect, and soooooo much easier than stovetop. Even made congee/ rice porridge perfectly just like at a Chinese restaurant. Made gelatinous turkey stock from the leftover Thanksgiving turkey carcass. So many options!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Wow! So well made and fun to use. I work long days so to be able to come home, load the ingredients, set the program and have a wonderful meal in the time it takes to read mail, change clothes and throw a load of wash in is great. Recipes are easy to find. Only one pot to clean as the IP only needs one pot to prepare meals in. I live it,"
5.0 out of 5 stars,At first I was afraid of this Instant Pot but then did the initial setup and then I made some macaroni & cheese and everyone seemed to like it.  I am very pleased with how easy it was to use and there were NO injuries.  It will take some practice but I'm excited to experiment and cook!
1.0 out of 5 stars,"The inner pot is somewhat flat making the instant pot unable to seal properly.  So can't use it for much.  Not sure how I can rectify that. Also it is very very tiny.  I knew that buying it, but to actually see how small. Good for cooking only for 1 or 2.  Tried to reach out to anybody or any department from amazon to replace the inner pot and have  not  received any response at all.  i'd be glad to return inner  pot  for replacement."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"We bought this instapot at the suggestion of our daughter. My wife has used this many times since we received it and loves it. The recipies we have made has turned out very well. It reduces cook time and its versatility makes it a hit. As far as ease of use, its really a matter of getting use to cooking with it. We love our instapot!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,We absolutely love our instant pot. We have made several different types of meals in it and are amazed at how well everything turns out. The best part is only having to clean one pot when we're done with dinner!
5.0 out of 5 stars,"All I can say is that I love this thing! I was quite skeptical and leary of the thing. Then, I got cooking. Soooo easy!! Everything comes out perfect and in the blink of an eye. My rice is fluffy, my beans are creamy, and my venison roast is tender and juicy. I can see that I will be using my Instant Pot several days a week. Oh yeah, clean up is a breeze. I rinse and wipe out the lid and wash the inset- done. Love it!!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've had this product for over two years. It's excellent! I recommend everyone have at least one.(Not for canning!I'm all for canning our own foods, but please use the old-fashioned stovetop pressure cookers for that. Electric pressure cookers are not guaranteed to stay at the constant high temperature that canning requires.)"
1.0 out of 5 stars,"We received the instant pot in one day BUT with no cooking pot!  Just the ones in this picture. It is a weekend and if they make this right on Monday when I called then I might change my review, but this is such a HUGE missing part."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"So far we've used it twice. First as a slow cooker to make a very tender new year's eve beef curry in 9 hours while we were out visiting. Second as a pressure cooker to make 3 pounds of excellent pot roast in about 1 1/2 hours from browning to slicing (otherwise more like 4 to 5 hours). I was skeptical about all the hype, but now I'm convinced."
5.0 out of 5 stars,Great cooking pot that save me lots of time in cooking for foods! It is great for soup and stew dishes! Havent tried other cuisines such as porridge or steam foods. Whatever the foods cooked from the pots can last me few days and i can simple store the inner pot with foods in the fridge. Not sure about cleaning because i always let dish washer to do it.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"My husband and I are in love with this! We’ve used it almost every other day and it’s a life saver on time (and clean up)! We couldn’t believe how little time we spent preparing our meals bc you can literally throw your ingredients in, add water, push your setting and boom before you realize it the meal is ready. Amazing & Highly recommended!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,I love it. Have used it for dry beans with ham. I should  have put one more  cup of water as a few beans were not completely  covered and the top was under cooked so be sure to add plenty  of liquid.  I also cooked a smallish chicken from rock hard frozen to just right tender. For both things I used used the preset times.
5.0 out of 5 stars,Everything I expected and more.  Who knew you could make hard boiled eggs in a pressure cooker! So much easier and quicker.  I have made fall apart tender roast and potatoes in under an hour.  That is great after working all day.  Well packaged for shipping.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"The technology on this pressure cooker is amazing. Every time I cook something, it is better than when I cook it in a pot or pot. I used to have another pressure cooker, but it broke, so I decided to spend more money and I am very satisfied with my purchase. Worth the extra money. I am not a big food, but I cook broccoli and green beans here, and found them to be great, and I find myself eating a lot now. Recommended"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is the first pressure cooker I've owned and I love it.  I initially purchased it on Cyber Monday when I saw it come up as a lightning deal.  At the time, I was looking to replace my slow cooker and saw that this had other modes like rice cooking and pressure cooking which I felt would be useful.  I've had it for about 2 months and use it all the time.  We make rice with it at least once a week and we have used it for soup, Italian beef, mashed potatoes, stew, etc.  It handles pretty much anything you throw at it and it's user friendly.  At first I was a little nervous about making sure I vented it properly, but it's very simple.  It's become one of the most heavily used items in our kitchen."
2.0 out of 5 stars,Don't have a clue if it works good or not was a gift for a relative. Was going to order another one but the price was $30 more and would not pay the extra. The add said order again ????????
1.0 out of 5 stars,"If I could give this a half star I would.  I was so excited to use this and save all this time on cooking and I literally used it twice.  The third time I was cooking ribs and it was barely cooked them and it was on for an hour.  I figured maybe I had to the wrong settings but as soon as I went to turn it back on, it just died and stopped working.  Maybe it's a defective one or maybe it just sucks.  Also, do not be fooled by the time.  If something takes 20 minutes cooking, add the additional 20 minutes for the pressure setting to heat up so that's really 40 minutes all together.  So much for cutting corners."
1.0 out of 5 stars,Cord was cut when arrived. Still works but I don't expect it to last
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Yes get this. A friend suggested this. I hate gadgets. And things that take up room on my counter. But wow! I can cook flavorful healthy meals with less watching and washing dishes. Your meals will still take time. But instead of standing over a stove I can turn it on and do other things. And most meals take a cutting board, a knife, and the instant pot pan. That's all I have to wash. After I get home from work, it's so nice to get a bunch of stuff together and throw in a pot. Even uncooked pasta and frozen meat."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"The best thing since sliced bread. I love my instant pot. I have actually gifted several and also own a 6qt. I was excited to get an 8qt so I could make larger quantities of food for my family and make sides in my 6qt. This thing is amazing. Makes beans from dry, not soaking in less than hour. Cooks a frozen roast that is tender and shreddable in under an hour."
5.0 out of 5 stars,I wanted an air fryer but didn't want another kitchen appliance.  This is great!  love the two tier!  Makes the best french fries and chicken wings!
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Ease of cooking just went up a 100% with this magnificent kitchen gadget... For a good lover that loves to cook various cuisines, the Insta-Pot is the best kitchen helper that doesn’t burn my food!!!"
3.0 out of 5 stars,"Although the cooker itself is very nice, I find the documentation disappointing. The five language manual has what features do, but nothing on how to USE the cooker. The recipe book included has a few meals that look appealing, but same thing, it doesn't tell you how to use the unit, just put stuff in the pot and push a couple buttons. For roughly twice what a comparable cooker would cost, I expected more."
2.0 out of 5 stars,"Personally, I found it too small. I made a chicken and rice soup, but had to make it in two batches. I mean, for that instance...It was okay, as I took the first batch to my father, then when I got home I made the second half of the recipe for myself.I bought it, thinking it was a great size for limited storage, and one or two people.I'm now the proud owner of the ninja foodi instead, and MUCH happier."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love this! The ability to make tasty, nutritious dinners and only dirty one pot is amazing. The first thing I made was a pot roast, something I have never made—it turned out beautifully. We mostly eat chicken, however, and this did an excellent job on that, too. I’ve even been doing some Indian dishes in it and all have been superb. Can not recommend enough!"
1.0 out of 5 stars,"Sauteeing was too hot, even on low, the pressure cooker hardly worked; an artichoke, after 15 minutes was not even near ready, and slow cooking ribs for 4 hours on high should have had them ""falling off the bone."" NOT! They were half done..."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This has been a very fun purchase. I also bought several pressure cookbooks and am enjoying trying various recipes.  Cooking in a pressure cooker really takes less time and the results are delicious.  If you want to cook using bain-marie (water bath) in your pressure cooker, I would recommend getting 

  
Flanera Flan Maker 1.4-quart Stainless Steel Recipes Included (2 Pack)









  
  
    
  .  Two of the pans fit into the pressure cooker at one time.  Besides main dishes like pot roasts and chicken, custards and flans turn out wonderful in the pressure cooker."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"My rice cooker died.  I wanted to get something more versatile.  Instant Pot fits that bill.  I use it to make brown rice. Still a bit of fine tuning but turns out good.  I also steam veggies, excellent and quick.  That's it for now."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great appliance. Beware of knock offs with Teflon that peels off after the first use and lack of instruction. I have used this pot many times already and have no issues. It was missing the cookbook, but I found a digital copy on the Instant Pot website. I am happy with my purchase."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Easy, quality, fast.  Prepared every thing in minutes, threw it  in the pot, went for a bike ride.  35 minutes later was eating great stew.  Way better than the old pressure cooker."
1.0 out of 5 stars,Failed within three weeks. Instant Pot Customer Service is terrible. Buyers beware.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love my instant pot and can not say enough good things about it!!  I use it daily.  I make apple sauce, chicken, hard boiled eggs, one pot meals, there's a million books and Pinterest posts for anyone's needs!! I highly recommend this to anyone trying to save time in the kitchen.  I love it so much I'm thinking of buying the bigger pot as well"
3.0 out of 5 stars,I was excited to get my pressure cooker except that metal was bent on the side.  Not worth going to the hassle of returning and waiting for another one to be shipped.
4.0 out of 5 stars,i’ve had this pressure cooker for three months now. The product works great but the other night I was making stew and somehow around the control panel the plastic started melting when I checked in.  its honestly a shame.  I really enjoyed making several recipes with this pressure cooker.  it’s been three months now so I can’t return it or get a new one so I have to go through the company support to get a new one...
1.0 out of 5 stars,I order an Instapot from Amazon on Dec 1 2017.  I tried to use it today and it's broken.  Do mot buy this product.  The quality is poor. One year's life for a product that is rarely used is teripple
5.0 out of 5 stars,Great for people who are crunched for time. Cooks very quickly. Clean up is a breeze since the inner bowl is removable. Happy with the purchase.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"with this cooker. Made Beef Stew, using same meat an veges from her slow cooker (4hours of cooking). took an hour. Came out very very good! love the one hour cooking time.  Plus we got it during the Amazon Big Sale. 6qt, half price!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"My Mom cooked with a pressure cooker all the time, the one on the stove and I was always afraid of it when I was a kid. I never even thoughtof owning one on my own, truly had no desire. Then one night I saw one that was electric and it was nothing like the one my Mom had so Ibought that...Low and behold, easy peasy...I am now enjoying a quick cooked pot roast, Spaghetti and meatballs in a jiffy...not the spaghetti the meatballs and sauce though...spare ribs to die for...yummy...and so much more...buy one you'll like it, and not be afraid!"
4.0 out of 5 stars,"This thing is great! Makes almost anything you can think of in a fraction of a time. I wish presume release valve is released by pushing it away rather than pushing it toward you as it could be a little less likely of getting hurt by super hot pressurized steem. Other than that, this thing is awesome!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Been hearing everyone talk about their instant pot... I was not disappointed. Since I've bought this 3 weeks ago I've used it for almost every meal! Love it! There was a little learning curve to how to use it, but if you watch youtube videos people explain it very well."
5.0 out of 5 stars,So far so good..still creating dishes..
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I can cook a so many dishes quickly and easily with this cooker.  I have made soups, ribs, cornish hens and quick spaghetti and meatball dinners.  Clean up is easy. I even accidently burned on my first use and the bottom cleaned easily with a standard kitchen scub brush.  I recommend this size cooker if you are cooking for a family but for an individual the smaller pot would be sufficient."
4.0 out of 5 stars,Love the versatility.  We'd give five stars if they gave a way to lift the tray out to flip the lower level stuff at the mid point.  Otherwise very cool.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This cooker has been outstanding so far. Very easy to use and the cook book is a nice addition to start meals right away. Easy clean up, attractive looking, an around winner. We also bought a strainer basket for steaming veggies."
5.0 out of 5 stars,Whoever came up with this is a genius and my only complaint is on me for ordering the biggest one they had thinking i needed one that big when actually i probably needed one half the size. That being said its a time saver and the food i make is amazing and roasts fall apart like i have never seen before. Love It!
5.0 out of 5 stars,Could I give this 10 stars?  Unbelievable how much I use this almost everyday.  I am now choosing to skip picking up dinner because I can make it at home faster.  Best kitchen appliance I have added to my kitchen in years.
5.0 out of 5 stars,So far I have cooked lentil stew and ribs. The saute feature saves quite a bit of time and makes for fewer pots and pans that need cleaning. Browning everything first before just closing the lid and pressure cooking is amazing. I don't think I'll be using my old slow cooker or oven for quite some time.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"So far so good.  Just cooked my first batch of french fries and they were crispy!  After first use, I'm loving it.  Clean up is minimal."
1.0 out of 5 stars,"90 days and still doesn’t work correctly! I’m not convinced yet that I really like this. I cannot get the steam valve to seal. I’ve watched several YouTube videos to try to figure it out but have not fixed it.  I cooked a roast  and although it did cook the roast, it was tough as leather.  Not sure if I will keep it."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"I've cooked only four meals so far, all have come out excellent!  Recipes using this cooker are everywhere on the internet.  Seems that whatever is in the bottom of the pot when pressure cooking will burn and stick to the bottom of the pot making it very difficult to clean. Using the trivet helps with this issue, but not for mac-n-cheese!"
4.0 out of 5 stars,Does not work as a crock pot. I get 10 min of use under the crock pot setting. Saute feature is wonderful.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This thing makes making a delicious meal ridiculously easy! I've made spaghetti from sauteing the beef to slow cooking the sauce in it. Pulled pork cooked over 12 hours, stews, soups, rice, chicken of various kinds, Moroccan chicken tagine. So many delicious meals and it is so easy to use! Pressure cooking frozen chicken with a bit of water and onions and garlic and other spices in about 15 minutes is amazing for a quick and easy delicious meal!"
1.0 out of 5 stars,"I have had this product for less than two days and have only used it once to cook rice as per the exact directions in the provided cook book.  The rice turned out great, but on the second use, all of its lights are flashing, the device now is beeping, and the display reads  ""C1.""  After googling this, I read a product forum stating this is a relatively common error having to do with a broken temperature sensor.This is very disappointing."
5.0 out of 5 stars,I'm not sure how I lived without it now that I have it!  It's become a staple in our kitchen and I definitely use it at least once a day. I might need to get more!
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have had this product now for several weeks have used it at least 10 times mostly as a pressure cooker it works flawlessly. I have used it to make yogurt and my only recommendation is to extend the time it Cooks up to 10 hours rather than the recommended 8. The extended time will allow the yogurt to firm up a bit better. The only drawback I find with this product is the remaining smell left on the gasket but it doesn't seem to affect the taste of any of the Foods cooked in it, I make a lot of turkey necks and ribs in this cooker and the sauce smell  stays in the gasket. Highly recommend this product and for the first time buyers of this product it is normal for the lid to be loose when in the locked position."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"Works well but only in very, very small amounts. The basket is very small as compared to larger, oven type models.But did work and crisps up the foods nicely.Quite heavy though."
5.0 out of 5 stars,This is so easy to use.  I love it.  I bought the 6 qt size because it's only me at my apartment and it makes so many different meals in such a short amount of time.
4.0 out of 5 stars,"Better Instructions. Bought on a recommendation of a friend. I had to iTunes how to properly use it. Once I figured out how it works, I enjoyed using it"
5.0 out of 5 stars,Great Instant Pot add on.  I also have their sous vide stick.  Great value.  Easy to use and clean.  Perfect size for cooking for 2.
5.0 out of 5 stars,I had owned another style. i took a chance to order this pressure cooker. I love the stainless steel. It doesn’t stick like the other brand. i have used it for a month. My prior cooking skills were terrible.  I have cooked everynighy using this. I created my own YouTube cooking channel. I love it. I is by far one of the best investment I have made. My weight loss is -15 from cooking healthy. My food budget is 1/2 of what it was. I don’t eat fast food. This was a win win for me.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is one item everyone should own. A little bit of a learning curve at first, but there are so many YouTube videos and recipes that make it really easy. If you have an RV, this is an absolute must! 1 pot meals that are so tasty! The pot is so easy to clean..  I don't know how it works, but I am a huge fan!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Quinoa in 1 minute? Frozen chicken in 20? For a busy single person who doesn't love to cook, I'm just mad I didn't get this years ago!"
4.0 out of 5 stars,"My wife loves this appliance. I was hesitant to add another kitchen appliance to our collection, but she likes it because it is kind of a ""set it and forget it"" product. The food that it makes taste good. I wouldn't recommend this to people with no storage or counter space as it is pretty large. I think there are suitable alternatives in most kitchens that don't justify the purchase if you don't have space. Overall, I do like the product and haven't had any issues this far."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I’m late to the instant pot game, but this has definitely made me an instant pot fan. I use it to proof bread dough and make dinners quickly. Having this device has given me more freedom to be creative with meals and get them served more quickly. It’s also very easy to clean. I definitely don’t regret having this appliance on the counter, and I was worried about having something taking up more space."
2.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought this in July 2017.  I've only used it about 10 times.  The ""manual"" button stopped working for timed items.  I contacted the customer service, they had me do a factory reset which didn't work.  I am glad so many people have had good luck with these, but I would not recommend."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"The Instant Pot is an amazing product.  You can do so many things in it.  We are getting rid of our crockpot, and rotisserie, at least right now.  We have only had it a couple of weeks and absolutely love it."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This has been a life saver for me! You throw all your ingredients into one pot and let it cook and all done, no hassle. In a time crunch this has really saved me, it cooked the food fast and clean up was extremely easy! I love it!!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have been very happy with this purchase. The 6 Qt size is perfect for a two person household. Very versatile, from meats to beans and veggies. Very quick cooking, easy operation, and quick clean up."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"The thing that really bothers me about this thing is how brightly it says ""OFF"" the entire time you're not using it, making it worth unplugging.  I'd like this changed to just leave the display blank when it's off, like everything else.  Or if they really want to, leave it saying ""OFF"" for a few minutes, before shutting off the display.Other than that, it's great."
5.0 out of 5 stars,Best thing I've bought lately. My son uses it frequently to make a meal for one. Adds lots of quick fix choices to our menu without taking up the space of an additional appliance.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought this because my doctor told me i had to give up canned foods.  Living alone and working crazy hours, canned soup was my go-to dinner.  Doc said too much sodium, and i said I bought the low-sodium kind; she said check the sodium level.  OMG.  A couple of my friends have this and I thought I would try it.  My boyfriend said the 6qt would be too big, but it's not as big as he thinks it is.  I have bought a ton of containers so i can freeze things (just look at the sodium content in a freezer dinner --- wow) and now i have good, healthy choices for lunch and dinner that take almost no time to make.  AND the doctor says i have lost 5 pounds since my last appointment.I don't leave a lot of reviews, but this is one of the best purchases i have ever made...seriously!You need this.  Buy it now!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I use this thing so often.  The programmable feature is nice but i dont use it anymore.  All it does is set a predetermined time for certain things.  Once you get the hang of it, you dont even use it.  The one thing i wish they did was move the nozzle of the release.  it is positioned in the back and i place it under the cabinet.  When release it puts condensation all over my cabinet doors.  The base doesnt fit flat on my stove so that rules it out."
5.0 out of 5 stars,The Insta pot is very good and makes them me very tender. I just don’t like how when you release the air pressure there is a lot of “smoke“ that could possibly turn a smoke detector off. But other then that came on time in a nice big box.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I wasn't sure what all the craze was on this thing, but it really is quite amazing. Perfect for the working mother that wants a home cooked meal in minutes. You literally can make a roast that would typically take me all day in a crock pot in 75 mins in this thing!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,It's everything everyone says it is! I love this thing!!! Life is so much easier with it.
5.0 out of 5 stars,This thing is my new best friend! I've always been terrified of my traditional pressure cooker. I have used the Instant Pot almost every day since it arrived and I'm not scared at all. You cannot go wrong with this item! It enables you to get a great dinner on the table quickly!
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Instructions are kind of strange.  I had a problem trying to figure out how to operate the Instant pot, there are a lot of buttons to choose from. However it does cook well.  It takes 10 minutes to heat up and get up to the high pressure, then the cooking time starts.  I made pulled pork and turkey legs in it so far.  Only have had it for a month.  Good thing you can sign up online and they send you recipes.,"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have had this pressure cooker for about 6 months now and I can't believe how well it works.Chili in 20 minutesPulled pork and under 2 hoursroasts, chicken, stews all come out great and I don't have to start a slow cooker at 4AM when I wake up all groggy so I can have a slow cooked meal when I get home.Just a great time saver.I also highly recommend  you get 'Great Food Fast (Best of the Best Presents) Bob Warden's Ultimate Pressure Cooker Recipes' cookbook. Lots of great stuff in there."
2.0 out of 5 stars,"The unit that we got from InstantPot seems to be faulty - it does not build up pressure on certain recipes! We have repeatedly had the same uncooked food as a result. These recipes are exact copies from other fans of the product, so it has been quite disappointing. More incredibly, the customer support from Instant Pot is giving us a runaround by requiring a science experiment to be performed before they can tell what could be wrong. That is really frustrating. I am giving it two stars only because of the huge fan following for this product and their support has been guiding us to solve the problem."

5.0 out of 5 stars,"We've only had this pot one week and already I am a huge fan! Seems very well made and so useful in the kitchen! It was a life saver on Christmas day when we needed to make multiple side dishes ahead of time, quickly! This is going to be a great time saver in the camper this  summer!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"We recently moved to Colorado and we're surprised that it took three hours to boil potatoes.  The instant pot does the job in 20 minutes.  Basically. Set it and forget it, my favorite type of cooking.  I read the book, but followed directions on the website One good thing.  I will try other things as the need arises, but for potatoes, hard boiled eggs or rice, this is great."
1.0 out of 5 stars,"This item has a technical issue with burning food.  Just look around the internet to see everyone complaining.  I tried mine first day....did everything I could to try to not get burn message...to no avail.  Amazon was awesome and refunded my money, no question.  Thank you Amazon.  Instapot, you have a problem."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"So far I love my instant pot.  It works just like I expected even though I was a little nervous to use it at first.  As long as you read the directions on how to use the steam control valve you will be fine.  I have several people at work that have these and we love to compare recipes and are learning new things.  I think my favorite thing to do are the hard boiled eggs they turn out perfect every time, we also love making Spaghetti & meatballs and meatloaf.  So far everyone in my family has loved everything we have tried."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"Good fitting parts. LOTS of instructions making it kind of difficult to use without instruction booklet in hand. I have used it twice and food was prepared well. Chicken breasts were moist and tender. Salmon from “freezer to plate” was a little underdone, so we needed to add a little cooking time in a cast iron skillet."
1.0 out of 5 stars,"I was so excited for it but the lid stinks from the food we made the first time. And it got a crack in it within the first week of having it.Other than the lid, it seems like it could be a good product."
4.0 out of 5 stars,It takes almost as much time to bring it up to pressure as it would to cook in a regular pot.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have a culinary degree and have worked in restaurants for 15 years. So I normally hate most kitchen gadget. Just give me a stove and a pot and I’m normally much happier. But I love this thing. So quick and easy. I do a lot of stroganoff, pot roast, beans, all kinds of things in it."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've really enjoyed my instapot! Last night I pulled frozen chicken legs out, put them in the IP, seasoned them, added a little water and 30 min later they were done! I've always cooked potatoes in 15 min as well as a few other time saving things. It was intimidating trying to read the instructing manual as I'm a visual learner but my husband taught me and now I'm comfortable."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I’ve used my insta pot nearly 2 dozen times since purchasing 2months ago. I started my first diet, a 21 day challenge and the recipes sometimes used It. My meals are so yummy! What a great investment."
