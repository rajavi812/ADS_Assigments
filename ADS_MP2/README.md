Web-Scraping and Sentimental Analysis on AmazonÂ Reviews

Abstract 

This assignnment includes web-scrapinng of data from a website - amazon.com. After creating the dataset, pre-processing is done and it is fed into the models built, Naive Bayes Classifier, Logistic Regression Classifier, XGBoost, Random Forest Classifier and KNN, which trains on this pre processed data and testing is done on the testing set and accuracy is calculated. To validate the accuracy, validation set is then fed into the models to see if accuracy is appropriate.

Dataset:

Dataset contains 2 columns:

Ratings - Ratings given by the customer to the product

Comments - Reviews of the customers on the product

Conclusion: Conclusion: After analysing the above models, we come to a conclusion that XGBoost model gives the best accuracy when compared with the other models at 89.00%. Followed by Random Forest at 88.13%, Multinomial NB at 87.93% and Logistic Regression at 86.47%. The least accuracy is given by KNN at 63.53%. But for the validation set, Multinomial NB given the highest accuracy at 89.57% followed by XGBoost at 87.97%. Random Forest Classifier and Logistic Regression is almost same at 86.96% and 86.77% respectively. The lowest accuracy for the validation set is given by KNN at 81.96%
